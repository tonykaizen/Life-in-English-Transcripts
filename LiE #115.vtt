What's up, everybody?

00:00:00.859 --> 00:00:03.310
You're listening to another episode of Life in English.

00:00:03.349 --> 00:00:05.919
I'm your host, Tony Kaizen.

00:00:06.349 --> 00:00:09.709
And this episode should be short and sweet because I just got a simple tip for you.

00:00:10.009 --> 00:00:14.269
A simple tip to help you understand and learn more English.

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:16.280
Roll the intro.

00:00:47.084 --> 00:00:54.434
A very common problem that many English learners have is that they can't understand native speakers when we talk.

00:00:54.704 --> 00:01:02.714
Mainly because we speak really fast or we use lots of expressions and slang and just things that you don't necessarily learn in school.

00:01:03.074 --> 00:01:08.034
So a lot of times in conversation, English learners find themselves just lost.

00:01:08.414 --> 00:01:12.944
They don't really know what to say or how to react or how to move the conversation forward and things like that.

00:01:13.274 --> 00:01:19.004
So many times English learners will enter a conversation in defense mode, you know?

00:01:19.004 --> 00:01:22.994
Like in a game of football or soccer, basketball, whatever you have offense and defense.

00:01:23.204 --> 00:01:25.364
When you're on offense, you're attacking, you're trying to score.

00:01:25.574 --> 00:01:29.284
When you're on defense, you're defending and you're trying to stop the other team from scoring.

00:01:29.934 --> 00:01:32.459
So I'm going to use that analogy kind of, to explain what I mean.

00:01:33.089 --> 00:01:36.629
So a lot of learners of English, they go into a conversation playing defense.

00:01:36.749 --> 00:01:38.429
They're just trying not to lose the game.

00:01:39.059 --> 00:01:41.219
They're just trying not to ruin the conversation.

00:01:41.429 --> 00:01:45.029
They're trying not to sound like an idiot, or get lost, or whatever it is.

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:48.659
And although I can understand that, I just don't think it's the right mentality to have.

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:53.129
Because most English learners in a conversation with somebody,

00:01:53.789 --> 00:02:00.179
whether it's a native or not, they find themselves in a situation where they don't understand what's being said.

00:02:00.209 --> 00:02:05.159
They miss a word or an entire expression, or they just don't get the idea of what's being said.

00:02:05.523 --> 00:02:11.268
And then a situation where most peopledo is pretend that they understand what's going on.

00:02:12.498 --> 00:02:16.578
So if I say something to you and there's a few words that you've never heard,

00:02:16.578 --> 00:02:22.038
you don't understand, you don't get the idea, you'll just let me keep talking and talking and talking,

00:02:22.068 --> 00:02:24.768
even though you have no idea what the fuck I'm talking about.

00:02:25.428 --> 00:02:31.128
Because you don't want to be rude and interrupt me, or you don't want to seem stupid for not understanding what I'm saying.

00:02:31.368 --> 00:02:37.218
You don't want to feel uncomfortable by asking me to repeat myself, especially more than once.

00:02:37.218 --> 00:02:38.448
Things like that, right.

00:02:39.138 --> 00:02:44.598
And then in situations where it's your turn to express yourself and you don't know how to say what you want to say,

00:02:44.758 --> 00:02:49.863
what most people do in that situation is simply try to skip over what they were trying to say.

00:02:50.393 --> 00:02:52.053
They just say, oh, nevermind, forget it.

00:02:52.293 --> 00:02:56.943
Or they'll completely skip that idea and just keep talking without actually explaining themselves.

00:02:58.893 --> 00:03:00.573
And to me that just doesn't make any sense, man.

00:03:00.573 --> 00:03:07.503
The point of doing a language exchange or talking to real people in English is to learn more.

00:03:07.533 --> 00:03:12.623
So if you're doing everything you can to avoid those difficult situations, you're not learning anything.

00:03:14.583 --> 00:03:15.208
You're not learning.

00:03:15.598 --> 00:03:19.048
So my recommendation to you is to go on the offensive.

00:03:19.108 --> 00:03:20.158
Stop playing defense.

00:03:20.158 --> 00:03:27.328
Stop being worried about ruining the conversation or seeming stupid or asking somebody to repeat themselves or explain themselves.

00:03:27.718 --> 00:03:30.828
Stop worrying about the consequence of doing those things.

00:03:30.858 --> 00:03:35.008
It makes absolutely no sense because if you don't do those things, you won't learn.

00:03:35.218 --> 00:03:39.118
And when it's your turn to talk, stop worrying about the fact that you don't know a particular word

00:03:39.328 --> 00:03:42.078
or you can't express the idea exactly the way you would like to.

00:03:43.308 --> 00:03:46.638
Because, unless you try to do those things, you'll never learn.

00:03:48.248 --> 00:03:49.008
That's just how it works.

00:03:49.008 --> 00:03:52.458
You have to allow yourself to be helped.

00:03:53.178 --> 00:03:55.248
Somebody can't help you if you won't let them help you.

00:03:55.488 --> 00:03:58.218
And somebody can't help you if they don't know you need help.

00:03:58.878 --> 00:03:59.478
You see what I'm saying?

00:03:59.508 --> 00:04:03.858
So the simple tip I have for you, like I said, is to go on the offensive

00:04:03.858 --> 00:04:07.278
and what I mean when I say that is to be intentional with your conversations.

00:04:07.788 --> 00:04:12.573
So in the context of you listening to somebody, if somebody says a word that you don't understand,

00:04:13.293 --> 00:04:17.343
stop them and ask them, "what does that mean?"

00:04:17.903 --> 00:04:19.023
Four simple words.

00:04:19.233 --> 00:04:19.953
"What does that mean?"

00:04:21.913 --> 00:04:23.563
And guess what happens when you do that?

00:04:24.463 --> 00:04:26.743
They explain to you what it means.

00:04:27.613 --> 00:04:28.063
Bam.

00:04:28.393 --> 00:04:29.413
You just learned a new word.

00:04:30.073 --> 00:04:36.523
If somebody uses an expression that you've never heard before, that's kind of confusing, stop them and ask them, "What does it mean?"

00:04:37.543 --> 00:04:41.523
'Cause so many people like, especially me, cause I've been teaching English for a couple of years now,

00:04:42.243 --> 00:04:45.153
I've had so many conversations with people who are learning English

00:04:45.663 --> 00:04:49.533
and especially if we're speaking face to face or on a video call or something like that,

00:04:49.533 --> 00:04:52.293
I can see in your face you don't understand what I'm saying.

00:04:52.533 --> 00:04:55.173
I can see in your face I said something that confused you.

00:04:55.383 --> 00:04:59.703
I can hear based on your response, you didn't really understand what I said.

00:05:00.453 --> 00:05:05.343
So what's the point in trying to hide the fact that you misunderstood or that you're lost in the conversation?

00:05:06.693 --> 00:05:11.973
That guarantees you're going to make yourself look stupid because now you're going to say something that has nothing to do with what I just said,

00:05:12.183 --> 00:05:17.553
or now you're going to completely miss something I said and lose the meaning of the conversation.

00:05:17.553 --> 00:05:20.823
And then we just have these unnecessary misunderstandings.

00:05:21.123 --> 00:05:22.773
And then you don't learn, you don't grow.

00:05:22.983 --> 00:05:29.613
And we don't connect the way that we could have if we had simply taken the time to find common understanding between us.

00:05:30.633 --> 00:05:31.203
You see what I'm saying?

00:05:31.853 --> 00:05:32.393
So it's like...

00:05:34.133 --> 00:05:36.878
Don't be afraid to ask somebody, "what does that mean?"

00:05:37.688 --> 00:05:44.378
That's exactly how you learn what something means, and the best part about it is you're learning it in the context of conversation.

00:05:44.618 --> 00:05:49.808
So you have context to add to the word, which means you're more likely to remember it.

00:05:50.018 --> 00:05:52.848
You're more likely to use it naturally, just like that native speaker.

00:05:52.848 --> 00:05:55.148
You see what I'm saying?

00:05:55.328 --> 00:06:00.488
There's nothing wrong with asking somebody to repeat themselves, even multiple times.

00:06:02.693 --> 00:06:04.523
It's, like, you're learning English.

00:06:04.553 --> 00:06:07.613
Of course you're not going to understand everything the first time perfectly.

00:06:07.613 --> 00:06:08.963
Maybe not even the second time.

00:06:09.983 --> 00:06:13.313
That's why it's important to find a teacher or a language exchange partner that has the time,

00:06:13.613 --> 00:06:17.603
the patience, and the interest in helping you, you know?

00:06:17.963 --> 00:06:18.923
That's why it's so important.

00:06:18.923 --> 00:06:23.243
Because once you have that, you should be asking hundreds, millions of questions.

00:06:23.243 --> 00:06:26.163
Ask them anything that comes to mind, you know?

00:06:26.368 --> 00:06:30.598
Don't let somebody say a word or a phrase that you don't understand and just continue the conversation.

00:06:30.868 --> 00:06:32.008
That makes no sense.

00:06:33.658 --> 00:06:34.348
No sense.

00:06:34.498 --> 00:06:40.978
And it's the same thing when you're speaking, if you don't know how to say something, ask them how you say it.

00:06:41.038 --> 00:06:45.063
Just describe the idea, and ask them, "Is there a word to describe that?"

00:06:45.333 --> 00:06:47.223
"Is there an expression to describe that?"

00:06:47.553 --> 00:06:51.573
And then once they tell you, you can even go further and say, "Is that formal or informal?

00:06:51.753 --> 00:06:52.863
Is that considered slang?

00:06:53.043 --> 00:06:54.543
In which context can I use that?

00:06:54.783 --> 00:06:56.523
Are there any other meanings to this word?

00:06:57.003 --> 00:06:57.813
Is that rude?"

00:06:58.293 --> 00:07:00.213
You know, stuff like that.

00:07:00.813 --> 00:07:07.503
So the simple, I said a lot, but the simple tip in, in its essence is ask more questions.

00:07:08.883 --> 00:07:09.723
Ask more questions.

00:07:09.723 --> 00:07:10.743
There's nothing wrong with that.

00:07:10.743 --> 00:07:12.093
If you don't ask, you will never know.

00:07:13.373 --> 00:07:13.908
You know what I'm saying?

00:07:15.108 --> 00:07:22.878
So many people make that mistake because they're just so afraid of what the other
person's going to think, or the effect is going to have on the conversation.

00:07:22.878 --> 00:07:26.208
But when you're asking questions, that means you are interested.

00:07:27.288 --> 00:07:33.498
And I've never seen somebody get upset or irritated because somebody was interested in them or what they had to say.

00:07:33.738 --> 00:07:34.548
That's a good thing.

00:07:34.578 --> 00:07:35.448
That means you're listening.

00:07:35.628 --> 00:07:36.678
That means you're paying attention,

00:07:36.828 --> 00:07:38.508
which makes the other person feel good.

00:07:39.018 --> 00:07:40.288
It makes them want to talk to you more.

00:07:40.998 --> 00:07:41.583
You see what I'm saying?

00:07:41.793 --> 00:07:44.973
When you pretend like you understand everything that's going on,

00:07:46.503 --> 00:07:49.683
you're only increasing the chance that you're actually going to ruin the conversation,

00:07:49.683 --> 00:07:50.823
which is what you don't want.

00:07:51.903 --> 00:07:52.463
You see what I'm saying?

00:07:53.433 --> 00:07:57.003
You pretend that you understand, you don't learn the things that you should be learning,

00:07:57.003 --> 00:07:58.533
you don't understand the other person.

00:07:59.943 --> 00:08:00.723
What's the point of that?

00:08:02.733 --> 00:08:03.013
You know?

00:08:03.943 --> 00:08:06.373
So stop being so afraid.

00:08:06.823 --> 00:08:11.943
I mean, you can't control how you feel, but stop letting your fear influence all of your decisions.

00:08:12.163 --> 00:08:16.683
It's normal to be anxious or afraid, or get nervous when speaking to somebody in a foreign language

00:08:16.683 --> 00:08:19.743
and you don't know how to express yourself, it's frustrating at times.

00:08:20.433 --> 00:08:21.393
But so what?

00:08:21.723 --> 00:08:22.653
It's part of the process.

00:08:24.063 --> 00:08:24.513
You feel me?

00:08:25.546 --> 00:08:27.496
Everybody goes through it, you know?

00:08:27.556 --> 00:08:34.946
But it's the ones that understand, "If I don't ask, if I don't try, if I don't make the mistake and get corrected, I'll never learn."

00:08:36.516 --> 00:08:37.646
It really is that simple.

00:08:37.826 --> 00:08:42.536
And it's the same thing with speaking and I'm being redundant at this point, I think.

00:08:42.536 --> 00:08:46.076
I'm saying the same thing again and again, but it really is the same thing with speaking.

00:08:46.256 --> 00:08:53.426
If you don't ask somebody how you can express a particular idea or feeling, and in which context and things like that, you're not going to learn.

00:08:54.986 --> 00:08:55.586
That simple.

00:08:55.586 --> 00:09:01.076
So you want to understand more natives, ask them questions when they're speaking, ask them, what do they mean by that?

00:09:04.966 --> 00:09:05.656
What do you mean?

00:09:06.616 --> 00:09:07.606
What does that expression mean?

00:09:07.606 --> 00:09:12.256
Or if you hear a sound or a word just politely, "Oh, excuse me, one second.

00:09:12.586 --> 00:09:14.566
You said this, this and this.

00:09:14.926 --> 00:09:15.616
What does that mean?

00:09:16.666 --> 00:09:17.566
What do you mean by that?

00:09:18.916 --> 00:09:20.806
Oh, oh, I understand.

00:09:21.076 --> 00:09:21.946
So is that slang?

00:09:21.946 --> 00:09:22.816
Is that informal?

00:09:23.026 --> 00:09:23.986
When can I use that?

00:09:24.976 --> 00:09:26.686
Is there another way to say the same thing?"

00:09:26.896 --> 00:09:27.646
Stuff like that.

00:09:28.396 --> 00:09:28.966
That's good.

00:09:29.746 --> 00:09:30.576
That's positive.

00:09:31.201 --> 00:09:37.201
That's going to help you learn and understand more when you're listening to natives and when you're speaking.

00:09:37.861 --> 00:09:46.081
So hopefully you can get the idea I'm trying to express here, and hopefully you actually take the advice and start to apply it.

00:09:46.081 --> 00:09:54.001
Because every day, man, so many people like my English students, people have done language exchanges with, it's like...

00:09:55.821 --> 00:09:56.216
The same way.

00:09:56.216 --> 00:10:00.536
People think just watching Netflix is going to make them fluent in English, which is not,

00:10:00.836 --> 00:10:03.896
people also think, "If I just talk to people, then I become fluent."

00:10:03.896 --> 00:10:05.126
But it's not that simple.

00:10:05.846 --> 00:10:08.336
You have to be intentional with your actions.

00:10:08.336 --> 00:10:12.746
You have to have a game plan, a method to the madness.

00:10:12.866 --> 00:10:13.466
You see what I'm saying?

00:10:13.466 --> 00:10:15.986
Just talking, of course, you'll, pick up on things here and there.

00:10:16.436 --> 00:10:21.961
But asking intentional questions, searching for understanding, making sure you understand every single thing.

00:10:22.141 --> 00:10:26.671
Now that you have the human in front of you, why wouldn't you ask them everything that's in your mind?

00:10:28.591 --> 00:10:35.101
Like, people pay teachers for that and you have a language exchange partner and you're not even using them correctly.

00:10:36.721 --> 00:10:37.351
You see what I'm saying?

00:10:38.554 --> 00:10:40.204
I don't know, just a simple tip, man.

00:10:40.204 --> 00:10:41.674
I don't want to take any more of your time.

00:10:42.064 --> 00:10:43.924
I think I got my point across.

00:10:44.669 --> 00:10:46.589
Pretty sure you understand what I'm trying to say.

00:10:46.829 --> 00:10:50.909
So if you haven't done this already, if you're not doing this at the moment, just give it a try, man.

00:10:51.239 --> 00:10:52.829
Ask more questions.

00:10:53.659 --> 00:10:58.109
'Cause that leads to more understanding, that leads to better conversations, deeper connections.

00:10:58.679 --> 00:11:01.019
Everybody wins in that situation.

00:11:01.169 --> 00:11:07.679
You will never go wrong genuinely and honestly, and respectfully searching for understanding.

00:11:09.089 --> 00:11:10.209
How could there be a bad thing?

00:11:11.799 --> 00:11:12.339
You know what I mean?

00:11:12.369 --> 00:11:17.169
But so many people try to avoid it to protect their egos, to avoid uncomfortable situations,

00:11:17.169 --> 00:11:22.449
to avoid looking like an idiot or ruining the conversation, whatever it is.

00:11:22.479 --> 00:11:29.109
So many people try to avoid it, which is why they don't learn, or it takes them forever to learn simple things.

00:11:30.219 --> 00:11:32.049
So you want to know more?

00:11:32.079 --> 00:11:33.189
You want to understand more?

00:11:33.819 --> 00:11:36.629
Ask more questions and ask better questions.

00:11:37.969 --> 00:11:38.429
That's it.

00:11:39.929 --> 00:11:40.209
Peace.

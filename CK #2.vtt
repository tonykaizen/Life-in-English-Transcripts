Tony Kaizen:
Tell that bitch to be quiet! Good morning, good afternoon or
good evening, depending on where you are

2
00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:25.500
in the world at the moment and what time are you listening
to this transmission. Here in the U.S. right now, it's about

3
00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:30.040
8 o'clock in the morning, Friday, August 13th, 2021.

4
00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:37.880
Now, it's Friday right now but you'd be listening to this
most likely on Monday morning. So good morning to you. Or

5
00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:42.480
afternoon or evening, like I said, I don't know what time it
is where you are, but it's probably Monday because this

6
00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:48.650
episode comes out on Monday, you know what I'm saying? But
anyway, happy to be here with you enjoying my morning cup of

7
00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:54.250
coffee. I don't know if I said this already, but this is
Coffee with Kaizen episode two and you can check this out on

8
00:00:54.250 --> 00:01:00.990
YouTube if you want, youtube.com/lifeinenglish , alright?

9
00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:08.800
So, let's get into today's episode. Now, if you don't know
who Jocko Willink is, you definitely need to. He's a former

10
00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:16.350
US Navy SEAL and now he is an author, a podcaster, a
businessman and an all around badass. And one thing that

11
00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:22.920
Jocko preaches a lot and teaches a lot is this idea, this
philosophy or this concept that he has called extreme

12
00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:30.970
ownership, which essentially is taking responsibility and
having accountability for who you are and everything that

13
00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:37.110
you do, everything that goes wrong, you know, taking
responsibility for all that for yourself and for your life.

14
00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:44.890
Now, having fought in wars and trained many men to do the
same thing over the years, I think it's safe to say that

15
00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:51.590
Jocko has had to overcome many different battles, both
internal and external. But the battle that we're talking

16
00:01:51.590 --> 00:02:00.740
about today is the battle between you and yourself, the
internal battle, the battle between who you are and who you

17
00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:07.200
could be. So let's take a quick minute to hear what Jocko
has to say about it.

18
00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:11.510
Jocko Willink:
Shut that down. Do not listen to that little voice.

19
00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:21.810
Instead, go through the motions, lift the weights, sprint
the hill, work on the project, get out of

20
00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:25.390
bed. But don't take today off.

21
00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:29.820
Not today. Wait until tomorrow. Don't.

22
00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:37.230
Don't give in to the immediate gratification that is
whispering in your ear.

23
00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:42.790
Don't really wanna get up and get out of bed? Yeah.

24
00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:45.650
I'd get up and get out of bed.

25
00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:54.650
Tony Kaizen:
Alright. Jacko is referring to that little bitch that we all
have inside of us. And when I use the word "bitch", I'm not

26
00:02:54.650 --> 00:03:00.510
talking about the ladies, not talking about women, females,
girls, none of that, alright? Because I'm sure you know or

27
00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:08.620
hope you know, that the word "bitch" is used in most cases
or in some cases as a derogatory term for women. But you can

28
00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:14.220
use that word many different ways, there's multiple meanings
just depending on the context. So in this context, when I

29
00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:20.900
say "bitch", the meaning of that word is more like weak
little coward. That's the way you can think of it. And in

30
00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:26.810
this context, it's used more with men than it is with women.
So if you call a man a "bitch", you're essentially calling

31
00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:32.930
him a weak little coward. He's scared. He's a punk, he's a
coward, he's a bitch. You know what I'm saying? So that's

32
00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:38.320
the meaning in this context, just so that's clear for the
rest of this episode. So, really what Jacko was talking

33
00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:43.660
about is that little bitch that we all have inside of us,
that little us in the back of our minds, somewhere in our

34
00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:51.560
soul or in our hearts, wherever it is that just is afraid of
who you could be. You know what I'm saying? It's afraid of

35
00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:58.200
change. It's afraid of hard work. It's afraid of sacrifice.
It's afraid of the pain that one must go through to become a

36
00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:05.100
better version of oneself, you know? So you always hear that
little voice saying, "I'm not good enough." "I could never

37
00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:13.990
do that." "I'm not ready." "No, don't go over there." "Don't
do that." "I'm too weak." "She doesn't like me." "He doesn't

38
00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:20.670
pay attention to me." "I could never this, I could never
that." "Oh, you just woke up this morning? Hit the snooze

39
00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:22.110
button. Yeah?

40
00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:29.260
It's only 5 minutes. It's only 8 minutes. Hit the snooze
button one more time. Yeah, yeah, yeah. We're not good

41
00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:35.230
enough to conquer the day anyway. We're not good enough to
do good at work. Not good enough to get a promotion, start a

42
00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:38.320
business, study, be a better person.

43
00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:47.690
Nah. Let's just stay in bed, hit the snooze button. Even
better. What's on Netflix? Grab your phone. Yeah. Get on

44
00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:56.320
TikTok, get on Instagram. Yeah. Hmmm, that bed feels good,
doesn't it? Yeah. Let's just stay here all day and do

45
00:04:56.320 --> 00:05:04.260
nothing with our lives. Yeah. Yeah, it feels good. It feels
good." That's the little bitch that's inside your head,

46
00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:10.200
trying to keep you from where you need to be. Because you
know where you need to be, you know what I'm saying? Most

47
00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:17.430
people that say they don't know what they want to do, they
actually do. A lot of people know what they want. They just

48
00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:21.460
don't know how to get it. And I think there's a difference
between those two things. So a lot of times when you get

49
00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:26.100
stuck in this position where you have an idea of what you
want, or maybe you're crystal clear about what it is you

50
00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:32.270
want, but you have no earthly idea how you're gonna get it.
A lot of times --myself included, this has happened to me--

51
00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:38.230
that little bitch in your head convinces you to just sit
there and do nothing. There's nothing you can do. "I...I

52
00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:44.450
don't know. I don't know. I don't know what to do." That's
not you talking, that's the little bitch. So when I say,

53
00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:49.450
"Tell that bitch to be quiet.", that's exactly what I'm
talking about. First thing in the morning, you hear that

54
00:05:49.450 --> 00:05:56.850
voice telling you, "Oh, let's just stay in bed. Yeah, let's
be lazy. Let's skip work. Let's skip the gym today. I worked

55
00:05:56.850 --> 00:06:06.050
out yesterday. Yeah, let's skip study today. I studied
yesterday. I can do it tomorrow. No big deal. Yeah, it's all

56
00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:14.550
good, right?" I'm telling you to tell that bitch to be quiet
because you got things to do. You got a whole lot of things

57
00:06:14.550 --> 00:06:21.550
to do. For example, become fluent in English, right? For
example, become a better version of yourself. And that's

58
00:06:21.550 --> 00:06:29.280
going to take work. That's going to take sweat, tears, pain,
you know, discomfort, awkwardness, all of that. And you

59
00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:33.820
can't have no little bitch inside you telling you that
you're not good enough, that you can't do it, that you're

60
00:06:33.820 --> 00:06:41.830
not ready, that you don't know this, that and third, you
can't have that going on... all that bullshit in your ear

61
00:06:41.970 --> 00:06:47.970
every single day. Because eventually, the crazy thing about
it is you start to believe it, you start listening to that

62
00:06:47.970 --> 00:06:56.970
voice -if you never tell it to shut the fuck up. It'll just
get louder and louder and louder and louder until it's all

63
00:06:56.970 --> 00:07:04.140
you can hear. And then all you are is this walking bag of
self-doubt. You don't believe in yourself and nobody else

64
00:07:04.140 --> 00:07:09.230
believes in you. Or even if somebody else does believe in
you, you don't believe in yourself because the inner bitch

65
00:07:10.040 --> 00:07:15.920
has conquered you. So as soon as you notice it, maybe you
never noticed it before. Maybe you thought that was you. The

66
00:07:15.920 --> 00:07:21.110
next time you notice it, you wake up tomorrow morning,
whatever it is and you hear that little bitch just..."Yeah,

67
00:07:22.520 --> 00:07:30.140
we're not good enough." "We can't do it." "We're not smart
enough." "No, we don't feel good. Let's try tomorrow or the

68
00:07:30.140 --> 00:07:35.350
next day. Or tomorrow." Tell that bitch to be quiet.

69
00:07:37.480 --> 00:07:37.770
Peace.

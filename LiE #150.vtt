00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:05.370
Speaker1:
So the first question for you is if you had to listen to
three albums for the rest of your life and only three. Which

2
00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:06.240
albums would they be?

3
00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:16.080
Speaker2:
That's a hard one. I listen to a lot of people, but a whole
album. Let's do listen to Beyonce. So I'm bringing all the

4
00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:24.420
way back to maybe Dangerously in Love. I can listen to that
that whole album. Right, right, right. Classic. Classic. Who

5
00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:29.070
else? Drake. Take care. Who else?

6
00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:33.710
Let's see one more and I'll throw out a name.

7
00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:34.680
Throw out a name?

8
00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:38.050
Speaker1:
Name? Kendrick.

9
00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:39.210
Kirk. Franklin.

10
00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:42.720
Speaker2:
Kirk. What album was that?

11
00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:51.840
If we want to bring in gospel, the album with melodies of
melodies from heaven know that's all to listen to a lot of,

12
00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:55.200
like, old stuff, like old CDs. Nothing really new.

13
00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:56.040
Speaker1:
But that's good, though.

14
00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:56.930
Speaker2:
Those would be my three.

15
00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:00.000
Speaker1:
Nice choice. Okay, so what are three things that you can't
live without?

16
00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:08.340
Speaker2:
Music. Even I could barely name three albums. I listen to a
lot of music, so I'll say music. I love working out

17
00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:17.190
my puppies. I have two dogs. What kind of dog? One is
Chihuahua. I'm picking Pekinese. And then the other one I

18
00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:23.730
just adopted. He's so cute. I just think to Milo. I've only
had him for, like, two weeks, so I don't know what he is,

19
00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:28.230
though. They didn't really tell me, but I think he's like
Chihuahua and Terrier. But I'm not too sure.

20
00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:29.520
Speaker1:
You dropped him from, like, a shelter.

21
00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:35.550
Speaker2:
Or something. So, Fulton County, I don't know if you guys
live here in Atlanta, but they're in need of people to adopt

22
00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:42.240
the dogs. They had like five dogs in each cage, but it's
gone down to like two or three per cage. But if you need a

23
00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:45.510
dog, please go adopt because yeah, they need homes.

24
00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:51.870
Speaker1:
Okay, well, next question is, if all jobs and professions
paid the same amount of money and you could do any of them,

25
00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:52.830
which one would you do?

26
00:01:53.900 --> 00:02:01.530
Speaker2:
Oh, to be honest with you, I would love to just give back to
people. Like if I can get paid to just give back or have

27
00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:06.300
like a non-profit where you actually get paid for it. I
would do that because that's really all I want to do is just

28
00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:07.530
give back and help people.

29
00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:13.620
Speaker1:
Now, when you think of giving, what do you mean? Like, is it
time or possessions, money? What's your favorite way to

30
00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:13.830
give?

31
00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:19.830
Speaker2:
I would say money. I would also say possessions as well.

32
00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:26.970
And it can be like food, like food, clothing. If I could
give shelter, I mean shelter to the homeless, I would do

33
00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:33.210
that because a lot of times, like, you know, how people like
have extra clothes and like things like that, like all

34
00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:37.860
literally, like pull over and be like, you need something.
I'll have like a trunk full of stuff. I know my friends

35
00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:42.720
would be like, What are you doing? Just land them in your
trunk. But yeah, yeah. Interesting. I know. Right.

36
00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:47.280
Speaker1:
Where does where does that desire to just give come from? Is
it always been like that since you were a kid or was that

37
00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:48.570
instilled in you by someone?

38
00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:57.420
Speaker2:
I honestly feel like we can't. There's things in life that
will happen to us that we can't control sometimes. And I

39
00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:05.070
feel like we should still treat everybody, you know, the
same with love. So I feel like I've kind of always been this

40
00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:11.520
way. I don't think anything, like, really happened for me to
feel this way. But yeah, I just like giving back to people,

41
00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:13.560
and I want people to be happy.

42
00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:15.340
Speaker1:
Your parents, are they the same way?

43
00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:22.260
Speaker2:
Yes, my mom. My mom is very, very giving. Like she'll give
you the shirt off her back. If there wasn't so much crime,

44
00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:27.510
we would actually allow people to, like, stay with us and do
things like that. But, you know, some people, you know, you

45
00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:28.590
just don't know. So.

46
00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:29.870
Speaker1:
Yeah, especially these days, right?

47
00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:32.400
Speaker2:
Yeah. It can be crazy.

48
00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:36.660
Speaker1:
And speaking of that, have you ever found yourself in a
situation where you were giving just out of the goodness of

49
00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:39.300
your heart and people end up trying to take advantage of
that?

50
00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:42.240
Speaker2:
Oh, that's a good one.

51
00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:50.430
I'm not going to tell a story. But I will say people that
are closer to me or friends where you kind of give or let

52
00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:56.370
them have things, but they don't really reciprocate,
reciprocate it. And I had to learn that people know what

53
00:03:56.370 --> 00:04:00.240
they're doing. Like sometimes they're like, Oh, well, I used
to give people the benefit of the doubt. Like, No, she

54
00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:04.980
wouldn't do that. Or No, she's not just trying to take from
me, but there are people that do do that and that will just

55
00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:10.890
keep taking, take and taking, not giving. Or when they
borrow money from you and you want that, you know, you're

56
00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:15.120
just like, okay, when you can pay me back and I'm like, I'll
get to what I get to do. When you borrow money from them or

57
00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:21.390
need something, it's like, Okay, where's my money? Yeah,
exactly. I'm like, Oh, my goodness. Like what? So yeah, it

58
00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:22.470
can be tricky sometimes.

59
00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:27.900
Speaker1:
But how do you react in those situations? Because at least
in my mind, if you're giving at least the right way to give,

60
00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:31.920
it's like you don't really expect anything in return. You're
just doing it because you want to. So when people try to

61
00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:34.620
take advantage of your willingness to give, how does that
make you feel?

62
00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:44.000
Speaker2:
Honestly, it makes me feel it's so it makes me feel taken
advantage of.

63
00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:53.520
It just depends. I feel like you learn people. So although
I'm not wanting anything in return, it's still like

64
00:04:53.940 --> 00:05:00.780
or something that are ungrateful. I'll say it's more like an
ungrateful thing. So I think grad. To kind of goes a long

65
00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:07.080
way for me. There's some people that may not care but me.
I'm like, okay, thank you. I'll be nice. I appreciate it.

66
00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:11.700
Yeah. Just know you appreciate it because if you don't
appreciate it, then I don't have to do it. You know, I can

67
00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:13.310
help someone else. That does appreciate it.

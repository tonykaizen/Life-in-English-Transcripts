00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:03.740
We were on Discord last night having a fascinating conversation, and at some point,

2
00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:09.750
We ended up talking about those four famous words that everyone struggles to pronounce like a native English speaker.

3
00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:17.290
Beach, bitch, sheet, and shit. How do you pronounce these words correctly?

4
00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:23.550
Well, I'm going to show you a simple exercise that'll teach you how to pronounce these words perfectly right now.

5
00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:26.850
Well, after the intro. Roll that!

6
00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:34.740
All right. Now, I hope I didn't get your hopes up with that intro,

7
00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:38.130
Because what I'm about to show you is nothing revolutionary or groundbreaking.

8
00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:42.910
But I do believe it will help you to truly hear the difference between the way these words sound.

9
00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:46.640
So grab a pen and a piece of paper because I'm about to learn you something.

10
00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:51.240
So let's get started with the first word. I'm going to spell it in and no matter where you are,

11
00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:55.720
No matter what you are doing right now, I want you to say the word out loud. Okay?

12
00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:05.090
So here we go. B E A C H. Beach. Exactly.

13
00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:06.550
I'm sure you got that one right because you're smart.

14
00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:15.120
B E A C H spells 'beach', right? La playa, a praia, la plage, la Spiaggia one, please.

15
00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:18.140
Hey motherfucker! This is life in English, man.

16
00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:23.690
Oh, yeah, my bad. But who doesn't love the beach, man? I mean, what is there not to love?

17
00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:29.050
You got the beautiful blue ocean, the sound of the waves crashing on the shore,

18
00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:34.200
The sand between your toes, some dudes selling whole coconuts for you to drink out of.

19
00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.630
And of course, hundreds of pretty ladies in bikinis or, you know,

20
00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:43.240
Shirtless dudes showing off the triceps, lats, and pecs or, you know, skinny,

21
00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:47.590
Shirtless dudes with slightly toned muscles and great personalities.

22
00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:54.950
On a side note, isn't it funny that women are totally fine walking around like, half-naked at the beach,

23
00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:58.720
But they wouldn't dare let a stranger see them in some lingerie or something like that?

24
00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:04.950
I always thought that was so funny. You know, like imagine if you order a package or something like that,

25
00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:09.200
they leave the package on the door and you have to go get it from your front door and bring it inside.

26
00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:14.380
And you just got on lingerie, maybe you were getting dressed or you just got undressed, whatever.

27
00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:17.850
You go to get the package, the delivery man is still standing on the porch,

28
00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:22.600
And just naturally, you would want to cover yourself. Oh, don't look. Oh, sorry. Right?

29
00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:25.970
But at the beach it's like, Fuck it, let it all hang out. Who gives a shit?

30
00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:30.450
Like, literally a shoestring just holding up a little piece of cloth, you know,

31
00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:35.760
Just covering certain parts of the skin. A small fraction of the skin.

32
00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:39.570
But fuck it, let it hang out. It's the beach. That's just funny to me.

33
00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:41.940
Like, the beach is maybe the only,

34
00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:45.810
One of the only places where women feel totally comfortable just walking around half-naked.

35
00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:49.030
Well, the beach and Instagram.

36
00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:52.390
But anyway, when you go to the beach, right?

37
00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:57.340
You might see a baddie, you might see a beauty, you might see a baby, you might see a dime.

38
00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:00.940
And let's say you, you're feeling confident that day, right?

39
00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:05.050
You've been hitting the gym all winter so you could get that beach body ready for the summer.

40
00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:10.060
You got that fresh haircut, right? You got on your super slick Speedo so you can show off your...

41
00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:15.250
Anyway, the beach is a public place, right?

42
00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:20.590
So you see nothing wrong with approaching this young lady to see if y'all have chemistry, right?

43
00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:25.770
But before you can even open up your mouth to spit that game you've been working on for the past three years,

44
00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:30.810
She takes one look at your super slick Speedo, and she just about laughs you off the beach.

45
00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:39.400
That's painful stuff, bud. But the good thing is, there will always be more fish in the sea.

46
00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:42.050
That's an idiom if you didn't know. All right?

47
00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:44.250
Now, let me show you really quick the exercise.

48
00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:48.690
Let me show you the exercise really quick so that you can see...

49
00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:50.770
You already know how to pronounce this word correctly.

50
00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:53.940
You just have to hear the same sound in different words. Okay?

51
00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:58.270
So now I'm going to spell four words. I'm going to spell them one at a time.

52
00:03:58.710 --> 00:04:02.490
And each time I finish spelling a word, I want you to say it out loud, okay?

53
00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:13.850
So here we go. Number one. T E A C H. Teach. Exactly. T E A C H is teach.

54
00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:29.940
Next word. R E A C H. Reach. Very good. Next word. S P E E C H. Speech. Okay?

55
00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:41.500
Teach, reach, speech. Last word. B E A C H. Beach, right? Teach, reach, speech, beach.

56
00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:47.530
All right. Let's move on to the word that so many people fear saying when they're talking about the beach. Ok?

57
00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:56.870
I'm going to spell it and then you say it. B I T C H. Bitch. That's exactly right.

58
00:04:57.200 --> 00:04:58.830
B I T C H spells 'bitch'.

59
00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:02.570
Now, I'm not going to give you a master class on how to use the word bitch in this episode,

60
00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:07.580
But I will expeditiously explain seven ridiculously common ways to use this word.

61
00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:11.150
But remember, this is considered a curse word or a bad word.

62
00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:14.870
So just be careful when and where you use the word. All right?

63
00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:21.360
So here are seven ways to use the English word 'bitch'. Number one, a female canine animal,

64
00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:25.840
Especially a dog, or a word that refers to a female canine, especially a dog.

65
00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:29.560
That might sound weird, but technically the word bitch does mean female dog.

66
00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:33.000
And that might give you some insight into why we use it in other ways. Right?

67
00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:39.550
But in casual conversation, we don't say 'bitch' when we're talking about an actual dog unless we're maybe trying to be funny.

68
00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:42.010
Like, "Yeah, that's my bitch" when they're talking about their dog.

69
00:05:42.010 --> 00:05:46.450
But we wouldn't really use the word bitch to talk about or to refer to

70
00:05:46.450 --> 00:05:50.080
Or describe a female dog in casual speech, just so you know. All right?

71
00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:54.180
So number two, an offensive word that describes a very mean,

72
00:05:54.250 --> 00:05:57.880
Overbearing or contemptible woman with a bad attitude, you know,

73
00:05:57.960 --> 00:06:02.930
So the same way you might call a guy an asshole or a jerk or a dick because he's really rude

74
00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:07.140
And mean and inconsiderate, you would maybe call a woman 'bitch' and you'd have like the same...

75
00:06:08.130 --> 00:06:10.380
You'd be expressing the same idea more or less. Okay?

76
00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:14.400
So number three is like vulgar slang for a prostitute, right?

77
00:06:14.770 --> 00:06:21.880
Because you have a pimp who has multiple prostitutes and he can refer to those women or those women can be referred to as his bitches.

78
00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:25.940
I didn't invent the language or the definitions, I'm just telling you what they mean. All right?

79
00:06:26.250 --> 00:06:28.310
So what is that, number three? So number four, okay?

80
00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:35.080
Also vulgar slang is when we say "bitch" we're using it to refer to somebody who is submissive to another person.

81
00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:39.680
So if you submit to somebody in this context, you are their bitch.

82
00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:42.030
Or if you make someone submit to you, they are your bitch.

83
00:06:42.030 --> 00:06:44.820
And this is slang and it's vulgar, right? But you know, if you say,

84
00:06:44.820 --> 00:06:47.520
I'm going to make you my bitch, it means I'm going to make you submit to me.

85
00:06:48.280 --> 00:06:52.570
I will dominate, you will submit, in whatever way you take that. You know what I'm saying?

86
00:06:52.570 --> 00:06:55.780
It could be physically, mentally, like just submit in general.

87
00:06:56.230 --> 00:07:00.380
Or it's also common to say, like, I'm going to make Monday my bitch.

88
00:07:01.450 --> 00:07:05.170
Now, Monday is not a person, right? But Monday is a thing. It's a day.

89
00:07:05.510 --> 00:07:10.270
So if I say "Monday is going to be my bitch" I'm going to conquer Monday because everybody hates Mondays, right?

90
00:07:10.270 --> 00:07:13.880
You hate getting up early on Monday morning after the weekend.

91
00:07:13.880 --> 00:07:17.340
So normally Monday ends up beating people down. Monday conquers people.

92
00:07:17.640 --> 00:07:21.360
But if you say, "I'm going to make Monday my bitch" means I'm going to conquer the day.

93
00:07:21.390 --> 00:07:24.920
I'm going to be successful, I'm going to be productive. Monday is my bitch.

94
00:07:24.920 --> 00:07:28.090
I'm in control. That's the idea. I'm sure you understand.

95
00:07:28.090 --> 00:07:34.500
So number five, also vulgar slang. And we use this word to refer to a weak, cowardly, contemptible man.

96
00:07:35.180 --> 00:07:38.460
I talked about that, I think, in episode 125 so check that out if you want.

97
00:07:38.980 --> 00:07:43.350
But a dude who's like, a weak coward, we refer to him as a bitch like,

98
00:07:43.410 --> 00:07:45.860
Man, he's a bitch. He's weak. You see what I'm saying?

99
00:07:46.290 --> 00:07:49.520
And we don't just mean physically, it's more of a mental thing that makes you a bitch.

100
00:07:49.520 --> 00:07:54.120
It's not your physical stature. We mean weak in terms of spirit, character and,

101
00:07:54.240 --> 00:07:56.470
You know, mentality. Hopefully, that makes sense.

102
00:07:58.400 --> 00:08:03.370
Number six is also slang and we use the word to refer to something that's like,

103
00:08:04.380 --> 00:08:06.330
Unpleasant or really, really difficult.

104
00:08:06.810 --> 00:08:10.030
Like, maybe your car breaks down and you have to fix it yourself.

105
00:08:10.520 --> 00:08:13.790
And I could ask you like, Hey, how's it going with the car? Are you making any progress?

106
00:08:13.790 --> 00:08:17.400
And he's like... You could say, Man, it's turned out to be a real bitch.

107
00:08:17.400 --> 00:08:21.930
It's like, the car, the process of fixing the car is a real bitch,

108
00:08:21.930 --> 00:08:24.280
Which just means it's really, really difficult and unpleasant.

109
00:08:24.280 --> 00:08:27.340
I'm not enjoying this shit at all. It's a very difficult task.

110
00:08:27.340 --> 00:08:29.430
It's a bitch. Okay? Hopefully, that makes sense.

111
00:08:29.670 --> 00:08:32.370
And number seven, the last one on my list is a verb.

112
00:08:32.440 --> 00:08:37.180
We use the word bitch as a verb in this case, and it just means to complain or to grumble,

113
00:08:37.180 --> 00:08:40.040
Which is kind of like a less common word to say complain.

114
00:08:40.740 --> 00:08:45.190
And you're just complaining about a bunch of stuff that most likely you could change if you really wanted to,

115
00:08:45.190 --> 00:08:48.520
But instead, you're just complaining like, Oh my God, it's so hot.

116
00:08:48.790 --> 00:08:54.190
Why are you doing that? Somebody turn on the... Like, you're bitching. You know?

117
00:08:55.980 --> 00:08:57.750
It's like classified as weak behavior.

118
00:08:58.060 --> 00:09:02.080
And that's why we call it bitching when you're just complaining, complaining all the time.

119
00:09:02.080 --> 00:09:06.420
So somebody might say "Quit your bitching". Like "bitching and moaning" is another expression.

120
00:09:06.420 --> 00:09:11.280
If somebody is just bitching and moaning, they're like, Oh God, all the time.

121
00:09:11.660 --> 00:09:16.820
Just bitching, acting like a bitch. You know what I'm saying? I'm sure you get the point.

122
00:09:16.820 --> 00:09:19.490
Those are seven quick and easy ways to use the English word 'bitch'.

123
00:09:19.490 --> 00:09:23.380
If you've got any questions, leave them in the comments or hit me up on Discord. You know what to do.

124
00:09:23.820 --> 00:09:27.780
So now, here comes the exercise. I'm going to spell four words, one by one.

125
00:09:27.910 --> 00:09:31.380
And each time I finish spelling the word, I want you to say it out loud.

126
00:09:31.430 --> 00:09:35.250
And remember, pay close attention to the way the words sound. All right?

127
00:09:35.250 --> 00:09:45.770
So here we go. Word number one. G L I T C H. Glitch. Excellent.

128
00:09:46.170 --> 00:09:53.960
Number two. S T I T C H. Stitch.

129
00:09:55.010 --> 00:10:02.580
Number three. W H I C H. Which. Excellent.

130
00:10:02.860 --> 00:10:06.650
So we have glitch, stitch and which. Ok?

131
00:10:06.810 --> 00:10:14.020
Last word. B I T C H. Bitch. That's exactly right.

132
00:10:14.220 --> 00:10:17.380
Glitch, Stitch, which, and bitch.

133
00:10:17.380 --> 00:10:20.940
It's not glitch, stitch, which, and beach. Right?

134
00:10:20.940 --> 00:10:24.700
It's glitch, stitch, which, and bitch.

135
00:10:25.150 --> 00:10:26.460
And I'm like, Bitch, I don't know.

136
00:10:26.460 --> 00:10:27.720
I'm like, Bitch, I'm growing.

137
00:10:27.950 --> 00:10:29.660
The resting bitch face kind of throws them off.

138
00:10:29.930 --> 00:10:30.730
I'm a bitch.

139
00:10:30.940 --> 00:10:33.390
Bitch is an offensive word to women. Don't use it.

140
00:10:33.570 --> 00:10:36.140
Bitch is an empowering word to women. Use it.

141
00:10:36.360 --> 00:10:38.050
Total compassionate bitch.

142
00:10:38.240 --> 00:10:38.960
Yo, bitch.

143
00:10:39.330 --> 00:10:41.100
Don't be a bitch. You got this.

144
00:10:41.100 --> 00:10:44.480
Chapter one is really a bitch but hey it gets better in chapter number two.

145
00:10:44.820 --> 00:10:48.300
There's a smart son of a bitch on the other side of every trade.

146
00:10:48.440 --> 00:10:50.210
You're a no-good son of a bitch.

147
00:10:50.660 --> 00:10:51.800
Science, bitch!

148
00:10:52.150 --> 00:10:55.490
Bill Langer is a son of a bitch, but he's our son of a bitch.

149
00:10:56.130 --> 00:10:57.600
I want my money, bitch.

150
00:10:57.600 --> 00:10:59.400
Don't call me bitch. I'm a grown man.

151
00:10:59.610 --> 00:11:03.400
Why else will we be reading this for the character development, bitch? Where?

152

Get it together, bitch.

153
00:11:04.480 --> 00:11:05.870
Wow, what a bitch!

162
00:11:37.790 --> 00:11:42.100
But now let's get back to the next set of words. Sheet and shit.

163
00:11:42.100 --> 00:11:46.000
We've done "beach and bitch" and we've heard the difference between E and I, right?

164
00:11:46.810 --> 00:11:49.620
Same concept here. Just two different words that people have trouble with.

165
00:11:49.620 --> 00:11:54.050
So sheet, I've already said it, but I still want you to say it after I spell it. Right?

166
00:11:54.360 --> 00:12:03.000
S H E E T. Sheet. Sheet. Holy sheet, right? Sheet.

167
00:12:03.390 --> 00:12:09.890
When you hear the word 'sheet' you probably think of that piece of linen that we put on our beds in between the mattress and the blanket.

168
00:12:10.640 --> 00:12:12.740
That's the sheet. But there's more than one type of sheet.

169
00:12:13.300 --> 00:12:15.990
So we have the traditional bed sheet, right?

170
00:12:16.350 --> 00:12:19.020
But you also have, I think what's called the fitted sheet,

171
00:12:19.370 --> 00:12:23.800
Which is kind of like that stretchy one that you put in between the mattress and the regular sheet.

172
00:12:23.940 --> 00:12:28.390
I don't know what you would call it. And they're always so fucking hard to put on the bed like,

173
00:12:28.390 --> 00:12:31.130
You put on one end and you try to stretch it across.

174
00:12:31.130 --> 00:12:32.680
You have to get on the other side of the bed.

175
00:12:32.680 --> 00:12:36.390
And when you pull that one and get it in its position, the other side comes off.

176
00:12:36.390 --> 00:12:38.480
You know what I'm talking about? Those fucking things.

177
00:12:39.700 --> 00:12:42.090
Anyway, those are bed sheets, different kinds of bed sheets.

178
00:12:42.090 --> 00:12:46.280
Now, I don't know if you've heard the song by the Isley Brothers "In Between the Sheets",

179
00:12:46.680 --> 00:12:48.790
But those are the sheets they were referring to in that song.

180
00:12:48.790 --> 00:12:53.480
And just in case you didn't know, in between the sheets is like a poetic way of saying 'in bed'.

181
00:12:54.160 --> 00:12:58.990
And they were using that phrase as a way of talking about some romantic activities that take place in the bed,

182
00:12:59.320 --> 00:13:00.800
If you catch my drift. Right?

183
00:13:01.550 --> 00:13:06.000
Now, in my experience in between the sheets isn't something we actually say in casual conversation, though.

184
00:13:06.630 --> 00:13:11.390
But if you want different ways to refer to sexual activity, you can say things like "In the bedroom".

185
00:13:12.130 --> 00:13:16.230
For example, what my partner and I do in the bedroom is nobody's business.

186
00:13:16.810 --> 00:13:18.150
And that's the same thing as saying like,

187
00:13:18.570 --> 00:13:25.200
The sexual activities that my partner and I participate in together are nobody's business but ours. You understand?

188
00:13:25.200 --> 00:13:29.180
So what we do in the bedroom, what we do sexually is only our business. That's the idea.

189
00:13:29.650 --> 00:13:35.970
Or you could say, I've got to buy new sheets because of what my partner and I did in the bedroom last night. Right?

190
00:13:36.110 --> 00:13:39.180
Or you could say something like "behind closed doors". It's the same thing.

191
00:13:39.400 --> 00:13:42.690
Like, what my partner and I do behind closed doors is nobody's business.

192
00:13:43.130 --> 00:13:45.340
Now, behind closed doors isn't always a sexual thing.

193
00:13:45.570 --> 00:13:49.120
Because you can talk with somebody behind closed doors and it really just means in private,

194
00:13:49.660 --> 00:13:52.430
That's what behind closed doors means. But depending on the context,

195
00:13:52.430 --> 00:13:57.340
You can say behind closed doors and imply you're talking about sexual activity. You see what I'm saying?

196
00:13:57.560 --> 00:13:59.850
Now, I told you there's more than one type of sheet.

197
00:13:59.850 --> 00:14:04.110
So another sheet that you might come across at some point in time is a sheet of paper.

198
00:14:04.110 --> 00:14:10.140
And it's kind of like the same idea, this long, thin piece of material in this case, paper. Right?

199
00:14:10.430 --> 00:14:13.690
Now, you can also say a piece of paper like, do you have a piece of paper?

200
00:14:13.690 --> 00:14:19.370
Or can I borrow a piece of paper? I don't know how you borrow a piece of paper, but you get the idea.

201
00:14:19.740 --> 00:14:24.440
You also have a sheet of metal and as you can see, it looks like a sheet of paper.

202
00:14:24.440 --> 00:14:30.600
So you can tell it's the shape of the object that makes it a sheet, not necessarily the material. Okay?

203
00:14:31.540 --> 00:14:36.120
So here's the exercise again. Four words, one by one, and you say each word as I spell them.

204
00:14:36.760 --> 00:14:44.000
Let's do it. The first one. B E A T. Beat. Excellent.

205
00:14:44.290 --> 00:14:50.420
Number two. M E E T. Meet. Very good.

206
00:14:50.700 --> 00:14:57.890
Number three. G R E E T. Greet. Excellent.

207
00:14:57.920 --> 00:15:04.620
Last word. S H E E T. Sheet.

208
00:15:05.120 --> 00:15:12.510
So you have beat, meet, greet, sheet. Beat. Meet. Greet. Sheet. Yay.

209
00:15:13.140 --> 00:15:16.890
All right, so again, it's that E sound. Meet, greet, sheet, heat, T...

210
00:15:17.500 --> 00:15:19.260
"T" I don't think is a word, but you get the point.

211
00:15:19.400 --> 00:15:23.120
So let's move on to the opposite word, which sounds very different to us.

212
00:15:23.150 --> 00:15:27.690
But I know it's trouble for you guys and that word is S H I T.

213
00:15:28.050 --> 00:15:34.220
Say it out loud. What is it? Shit. Exactly. S H I T spells shit.

214
00:15:34.470 --> 00:15:39.220
Now, this word, much like the word bitch, has many different meanings and uses in the English language.

215
00:15:39.440 --> 00:15:40.990
So let me share a few with you real quick.

216
00:15:41.290 --> 00:15:45.580
Number one, we can use the word shit to refer to stuff or things.

217
00:15:45.900 --> 00:15:48.430
For example, I could say, I've got a lot of shit to do,

218
00:15:49.410 --> 00:15:53.570
And that's just another way of saying I have a lot of things to do, I have a lot of stuff to do.

219
00:15:53.570 --> 00:15:58.540
And by the way, a lot of English learners think that things and stuffs is the equivalent

220
00:15:58.540 --> 00:16:02.130
Because you have one thing or many things, one stuff or many stuffs.

221
00:16:02.350 --> 00:16:06.910
But that's not how it works. Stuff is like an uncountable now and you can't have stuffs.

222
00:16:07.180 --> 00:16:09.550
Stuff just means things. So if I say stuff,

223
00:16:09.550 --> 00:16:12.960
It's implicit that we're talking about more than one thing. I just wanted to make that clear.

224
00:16:13.310 --> 00:16:15.910
So I have a lot of things to do or have a lot of stuff to do.

225
00:16:15.910 --> 00:16:20.060
I got a lot of shit to do. Or I might say something like, Don't touch my shit.

226
00:16:20.880 --> 00:16:23.610
Which simply means don't touch my things, don't touch my possessions, you know?

227
00:16:23.610 --> 00:16:29.180
All right, another way we can use this word is to talk about things like problems or drama or annoyances.

228
00:16:29.450 --> 00:16:33.580
For example, I could be talking to you and say, You know what? I'm tired of dealing with your shit.

229
00:16:34.480 --> 00:16:37.050
Which means I'm tired of dealing with your drama, your problems,

230
00:16:37.570 --> 00:16:39.000
The things that you do that annoy me.

231
00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:44.320
All of your shit, all that negativity, all that bullshit. I'm tired of it. You see?

232
00:16:44.800 --> 00:16:47.980
Or I could say something like, Listen, bro, don't get me involved in your shit.

233
00:16:49.050 --> 00:16:50.660
I do not want to be involved in your shit.

234
00:16:50.690 --> 00:16:54.040
I don't want to be involved in your problems, your drama, your nonsense. You understand?

235
00:16:54.530 --> 00:16:59.120
Or somebody could say, Get your shit together. Get your shit together.

236
00:16:59.120 --> 00:17:02.410
And what that means is like, get your life under control.

237
00:17:02.410 --> 00:17:06.110
All these problems and drama and nonsense you got going on in your life, get it under control.

238
00:17:06.620 --> 00:17:10.800
Get it together. Get your shit together, bro. You see what I'm saying?

239
00:17:11.280 --> 00:17:15.770
All right. Number three is a noun. The word 'shit' is a noun in this case and it just means poop.

240
00:17:16.230 --> 00:17:22.360
Fecal matter. Feces, right? Everybody poops. So I'm sure you know what I'm talking about.

241
00:17:22.360 --> 00:17:27.530
And another word for poop is shit. So somebody might say, like, I have to take a shit.

242
00:17:28.620 --> 00:17:32.680
It's a vulgar way of saying, I have to go number two. I have to defecate, you know?

243
00:17:32.680 --> 00:17:37.080
And there's also a verb. Number four, another way you can use it is as a verb like,

244
00:17:37.380 --> 00:17:43.840
My dog shit on my new carpet. My dog defecated or pooped, went number two on my new carpet.

245
00:17:44.110 --> 00:17:46.750
Or I can't believe he shit his pants at the wedding,

246
00:17:47.470 --> 00:17:51.470
Which means he pooped in his pants at the wedding. He shit in his pants.

247
00:17:51.470 --> 00:17:55.090
You see what I'm saying? So I'm sure you get the point. Right?

248
00:17:55.090 --> 00:17:59.420
But some other ways that you can use the word 'shit' is in a word shitstorm.

249
00:18:00.150 --> 00:18:04.170
That's another way to use the word. And a shitstorm kind of going back to usage number two,

250
00:18:04.170 --> 00:18:07.550
Which is just like problems and drama, if you're experiencing a shitstorm,

251
00:18:07.550 --> 00:18:12.040
It just means like a lot of chaos and drama and problems are happening at the same time. You know?

252
00:18:12.040 --> 00:18:16.860
Like 2020 was a shitstorm, so to speak. Hopefully, you get the idea.

253
00:18:17.090 --> 00:18:22.020
It's a storm of shit, bad things, problems, something you don't want. You see what I'm saying?

254
00:18:22.780 --> 00:18:28.250
Or somebody could be full of shit. If somebody is full of shit that means that they're lying.

255
00:18:28.970 --> 00:18:31.750
They're making up things or inventing things. They don't know what they're talking about.

256
00:18:32.290 --> 00:18:35.130
And I'm sure you've heard somebody like that before. You're listening to them and it's like,

257
00:18:35.590 --> 00:18:39.710
Clear they have no idea what the fuck they're talking about and they're just making it up as they go along.

258
00:18:40.010 --> 00:18:46.030
They're full of shit. Literally full of poop, feces, nonsense, idiocy.

259
00:18:46.030 --> 00:18:49.580
They're full of shit. No bueno. You know what I'm saying?

260
00:18:50.020 --> 00:18:53.700
Or if somebody could be talking shit, somebody could be talking shit.

261
00:18:53.700 --> 00:19:03.140
So to talk shit just means, like, to say reckless, offensive, nonsensical things to somebody else, you know?

262
00:19:03.140 --> 00:19:05.340
So somebody might be popping off at the mouth.

263
00:19:05.340 --> 00:19:07.940
Talking and talking and talking about how they're going to physically hurt you,

264
00:19:08.550 --> 00:19:09.990
How they're going to do this to you and that to you.

265
00:19:09.990 --> 00:19:12.210
They're just talking shit, but they're not doing anything.

266
00:19:12.610 --> 00:19:16.190
Or somebody might be making jokes about your appearance,

267
00:19:16.190 --> 00:19:19.210
Saying you're ugly, saying you're stupid, whatever. They're talking shit.

268
00:19:19.210 --> 00:19:23.980
Saying a bunch of negative things that don't help you in any way. It's nonsense.

269
00:19:23.980 --> 00:19:28.550
It's negativity. It's hurtful in some way. It's just not good.

270
00:19:28.550 --> 00:19:32.400
You don't want it. Kind of like actual shit. You know what I'm saying?

271
00:19:32.890 --> 00:19:36.470
So hopefully you can get the idea of the way we use the word 'shit' in many cases, right?

272
00:19:36.470 --> 00:19:40.290
So those are some ways that we use them in casual speech on a daily basis.

273
00:19:40.310 --> 00:19:42.870
So finally, here's the exercise. Here we go.

274
00:19:43.330 --> 00:19:49.980
First word. B I T. How do you say that? Bit. Excellent.

275
00:19:50.120 --> 00:19:55.800
Number two. H I T. Hit. All right.

276
00:19:55.960 --> 00:20:02.500
Number three. S P I T. Spit. Very good.

277
00:20:02.720 --> 00:20:08.240
Last one. S H I T. Shit.

278
00:20:08.740 --> 00:20:13.420
That's also another way you can use 'shit' is like an exclamation when somebody does something cool or impressive.

279
00:20:14.040 --> 00:20:21.190
Like, Shit! Holy shit! Oh, shit! That was crazy shit! Sheesh!

280
00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:24.050
You know what I'm saying? That's another way you can use it.

281
00:20:24.070 --> 00:20:31.120
But back to the exercise. Bit, hit, spit and shit. It's not beat, heat, speet, and sheet.

282
00:20:31.720 --> 00:20:37.080
Holy shit. That's not how we pronounce that word. It's an 'ih' sound.

283
00:20:37.310 --> 00:20:39.310
And I got, you know, all the weird shit.

284
00:20:39.680 --> 00:20:41.570
My mother was a chair, you piece of shit. Fuck, what?

285
00:20:41.570 --> 00:20:46.440
Dates back to 2400 B.C.? Holy shit!

286
00:20:46.950 --> 00:20:47.930
That doesn't mean shit.

287
00:20:48.040 --> 00:20:49.800
Enough listening, start doing shit.

288
00:20:50.200 --> 00:20:52.780
I don't give a shit what they say. I'll be dead.

289
00:20:53.080 --> 00:20:56.400
Earlier this week, I found out you were coming, and I was just like, Oh, shit.

290
00:20:56.480 --> 00:20:58.220
Well, shit!

291
00:20:58.380 --> 00:21:00.010
Fuck your Hollywood shit.

292
00:21:00.220 --> 00:21:02.620
I sat down beside this white guy. He almost shit his pants.

293
00:21:02.740 --> 00:21:06.110
Until the day you wake up and realize, Holy shit, Jeff was right.

294
00:21:06.290 --> 00:21:08.720
So they stopped watching me, and then they go watch worse shit.

295
00:21:09.040 --> 00:21:12.720
Then quit, you slimy fucking walrus-looking piece of shit!

296
00:21:13.140 --> 00:21:17.160
Okay, so just a review. Here are the four sets of words that you can use to train yourself

297
00:21:17.160 --> 00:21:20.560
To notice the difference between the sounds we make in English.

298
00:21:20.820 --> 00:21:26.250
Set number one. Teach, Reach, Speech, and Beach.

299
00:21:26.250 --> 00:21:28.640
Write those words down and say them again, again and again.

300
00:21:28.880 --> 00:21:32.080
Put them into Google. You can actually go on Google and type in how to pronounce

301
00:21:32.510 --> 00:21:35.620
And then enter the word and a robot will show you how to pronounce it.

302
00:21:35.620 --> 00:21:36.800
And it's obviously a robot,

303
00:21:36.800 --> 00:21:40.220
But it's better than nothing if you really need to hear how the word is pronounced, right?

304
00:21:40.220 --> 00:21:43.140
So that's set number one. Teach, reach, speech and beach.

305
00:21:43.410 --> 00:21:48.880
Number two. Glitch, stitch, which, and bitch. Okay?

306
00:21:49.120 --> 00:21:53.940
Number three. Beat, meet, greet, and sheet.

307
00:21:54.270 --> 00:22:01.520
And number four. Bit, hit, spit, and shit. Okay? Those are the four sets of words.

308
00:22:01.520 --> 00:22:06.710
Write them down and practice them until you have mastered the English pronunciation. You got me?

309
00:22:07.250 --> 00:22:07.920
But that's it, my friend.

310
00:22:07.920 --> 00:22:09.510
Thank you so much for your time and your attention.

311
00:22:09.510 --> 00:22:14.390
I really hope this episode was helpful to you and I'll definitely talk to you soon. Peace!

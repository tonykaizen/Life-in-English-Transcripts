00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:00.960
Tony Kaizen:
Alright, Brandon, right?

2
00:00:01.140 --> 00:00:01.490
Brandon:
Yes.

3
00:00:01.490 --> 00:00:05.670
Tony Kaizen:
Alright, Brandon. So if you had to listen to three albums
for the rest of your life, which albums would they be?

4
00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:15.630
Brandon:
I'm going to say LANY by LANY, which is a self-titled album.
Umm, Come Home The Kids Miss You by Jack Harlow, umm...and

5
00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:18.040
then, Continuum by John Mayer.

6
00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:20.680
Tony Kaizen:
LANY is the name of the artist, right?

7
00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:21.780
Brandon:
Yeah, it's a band. Yeah.

8
00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:23.050
Tony Kaizen:
Okay. What type of music is that?

9
00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:24.680
Brandon:
It's like alternative pop from California.

10
00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:28.610
Tony Kaizen:
Okay. LANY. Nice. Alright, so what are three things that you
can't live without?

11
00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:34.820
Brandon:
Food. My cat.

12
00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:39.010
And validation from the internet.

13
00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:42.880
Tony Kaizen:
Ooh. Validation from the internet.

14
00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:44.360
Brandon:
It's a real thing.

15
00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:46.030
Tony Kaizen:
It is, man. You really feel like you can't live without it?

16
00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:51.570
Brandon:
Even...Even...Even in saying that you don't want it or
saying that you want a break, I feel like people are like,

17
00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:56.130
"Oh, I'm going to be off of Instagram." They want...they
want you to be like, "Why?" They want you to check on them,

18
00:00:56.310 --> 00:00:56.430
you know?

19
00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:57.590
Tony Kaizen:
Hmm, interesting.

20
00:00:57.950 --> 00:01:02.670
Brandon:
So I think we're...I think it's...yeah. The biggest drug our
generation probably has a problem with is validation...

21
00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:03.160
Tony Kaizen:
Validation.

22
00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:04.860
Brandon:
...yeah. So...

23
00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:08.700
Tony Kaizen:
I have to agree with that, unfortunately, man. Do you post
online and stuff like that?

24
00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:12.670
Brandon:
Yeah. Yeah. Cos I make music so like I have to.

25
00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:13.070
Tony Kaizen:
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

26
00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.290
Brandon:
And then Tik Tok, I like...I like posting there, too.

27
00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:17.740
Tony Kaizen:
What type of music you make?

28
00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:18.710
Brandon:
Alternative pop.

29
00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.970
Tony Kaizen:
Okay, nice. After, Imma get your your handle so I can check
it out.

30
00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:22.780
Brandon:
Yeah, yeah, for sure.

31
00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:28.070
Tony Kaizen:
Alright. So I think we kind of got an idea of what you like
to do, but I'm still gonna ask you, if all jobs paid the

32
00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:30.610
same and you could do any job, what job would you do?

33
00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:36.830
Brandon:
Umm...I'd probably tour. I'd probably go on music...go on
tour playing music.

34
00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:39.300
Tony Kaizen:
Hmm. Do you make music by yourself? You're in a band or?

35
00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:43.230
Brandon:
I'm a solo artist, but I have, like, a producer and a band,
so. Yeah.

36
00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:48.390
Tony Kaizen:
Nice. Okay. What is it about music that that gets you going?
Why would you choose that job specifically?

37
00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:55.920
Brandon:
Umm, it's like therapy, I think, like, writing something. I
like writing. And then it transpiring into like something

38
00:01:56.580 --> 00:02:01.670
that you can hear and then something visual and something
that people can feel when they're seeing you play. It's a

39
00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:05.620
cool form of therapy and then giving to people, giving
energy.

40
00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:09.400
Tony Kaizen:
I like that. The energy exchange part, right? Especially
when you're touring live.

41
00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:15.900
Brandon:
For sure. Yeah. Yeah. I've gotten to play a few shows here
and that's just been cool. So I want to go other places.

42
00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:19.300
Tony Kaizen:
That's interesting too, because you said you make
alternative pop as the genre, right?

43
00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:19.420
Brandon:
Yeah. Yeah.

44
00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:26.270
Tony Kaizen:
In a city like Atlanta, which is kind of like Black Mecca,
let's call it. How's the reception been when people see you

45
00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:27.590
making pop music?

46
00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:33.380
Brandon:
It's different. I mean, you feel like you have to win people
over in some ways, but it's also an advantage. It's almost

47
00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:35.090
like being like a white rapper, I feel like.

48
00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:36.510
Tony Kaizen:
Hmm. That's interesting.

49
00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:43.970
Brandon:
You're trying to break into a market where, I mean, it's a
little bit easier for me, I guess, because the market is so

50
00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:51.260
inclusive where I feel like rap is more gatekept. This is
more like, you know, there's wild cards like Khalid and

51
00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:54.530
stuff like that, that find their way into the genre. So.

52
00:02:54.990 --> 00:03:00.260
Tony Kaizen:
Why do you think that is though? So like specifically hip
hop. It's almost like a "members only club" where you have

53
00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:01.920
to fit into the box to be accepted.

54
00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:09.270
Brandon:
I think it's gatekeeping umm...and I...and I think it's
valid too because we...Black culture feels like they've been

55
00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:14.010
excluded from so many things and it's like this is finally
something that we've had and we've established and it's

56
00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:20.270
like, people don't want a Jack Harlow in it. And I think if
someone pays the respect enough to our community and our

57
00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:25.040
culture, and they should be able to, you know, partake,
especially if they're good at it. So.

58
00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:30.540
Tony Kaizen:
Definitely. But let's imagine that somebody really didn't
have any appreciation or even knowledge of the history, and

59
00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:34.900
the culture, and the art form, do you think that's like a
requisite or you think that'd be totally fine, too?

60
00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:41.980
Brandon:
No, I think...I think you have to...your rite of passage is
embracing the culture, not profiting off of it, and not

61
00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:44.730
embracing it is, I think, disrespectful.

62
00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:45.560
Tony Kaizen:
Interesting.

63
00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:46.360
Brandon:
So yeah.

64
00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:50.610
Tony Kaizen:
Okay. So now I'm going to switch gears a little bit. Out of
curiosity, how many languages do you speak?

65
00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:52.770
Brandon:
Two, fluently.

66
00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:53.170
Tony Kaizen:
Really?

67
00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:56.790
Brandon:
Yeah, just umm...sign language and English.

68
00:03:57.230 --> 00:03:57.340
Tony Kaizen:
Okay.

69
00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:00.570
Brandon:
Yeah, but I'm going to Europe this summer, so I want to
learn a little bit of French.

70
00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:03.610
Tony Kaizen:
French? Yeah. Okay. So if you could learn any language, it
would be French?

71
00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:04.080
Brandon:
French. Yeah.

72
00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:04.440
Tony Kaizen:
Okay.

73
00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:06.470
Brandon:
I think it's just like, it rolls off the tongue nicely.

74
00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:08.310
Tony Kaizen:
It does sound nice.

75
00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:08.430
Brandon:
Yeah.

76
00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:11.820
Tony Kaizen:
Yeah, I like it. So if you could visit any country, would it
be France or another one?

77
00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:19.020
Brandon:
France. Yeah, I'm going to London, umm...And then...or yeah,
I don't know. The UK. Is that a country? Yeah, the UK, and

78
00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:23.670
then France. But I'm most excited for France because I feel
like the UK is going to be the most similar to the United

79
00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:27.630
States cos we're like a spinoff of them. So it's like, yeah.

80
00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:28.910
Tony Kaizen:
The remix, right?

81
00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:31.050
Brandon:
Yeah, the remix, the spicy version.

82
00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:31.610
Tony Kaizen:
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I dig it.

83
00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:32.880
Brandon:
Yeah, chaotic, but yeah.

84
00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:34.610
Tony Kaizen:
Okay, cool, man. Brandon, right?

85
00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:35.040
Brandon:
Yes.

86
00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:35.930
Tony Kaizen:
That's cool. Appreciate you, man.

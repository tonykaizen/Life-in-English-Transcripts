Do you see the world through your eyes or through your culture?

00:00:09.613 --> 00:00:12.823
Do you see the world through your eyes or through your culture?

00:00:12.823 --> 00:00:19.093
This is a question that I've thought about from time to time whenever I had an interaction with someone from another country.

00:00:19.993 --> 00:00:22.893
I've talked to people from every continent from various walks of life,

00:00:23.333 --> 00:00:26.633
and a lot of those people had these preconceived ideas of what the U.S.

00:00:26.653 --> 00:00:27.123
is like,

00:00:27.403 --> 00:00:30.163
and what Americans are like, and what we think and believe.

00:00:30.933 --> 00:00:35.383
Most of the time they were partially correct and partially incorrect in their assumptions,

00:00:35.923 --> 00:00:40.363
but that's always the case when you're making general statements about hundreds of millions of people, right?

00:00:41.563 --> 00:00:43.543
And that's true for every country, I suppose.

00:00:44.383 --> 00:00:50.243
We have reputations that we've created for ourselves and reputations that other people have given us as well.

00:00:51.153 --> 00:00:53.193
None of them ever tell the whole story, though.

00:00:54.453 --> 00:01:01.123
We, as humans have this tendency to look for patterns and then make
generalizations about everyone and everything based on those patterns.

00:01:01.933 --> 00:01:07.183
Although this helps us say time when trying to find the answers to our questions or come to conclusions,

00:01:07.483 --> 00:01:12.583
it doesn't mean that we will always find the right answers to our questions or come to the right conclusions.

00:01:13.483 --> 00:01:18.843
Most of the time, the generalizations we make are based on observations that were made without context,

00:01:19.193 --> 00:01:23.188
which only increases the chances that our generalizations will be inaccurate.

00:01:24.328 --> 00:01:25.918
Maybe I'm not making a lot of sense here.

00:01:26.218 --> 00:01:27.388
So let me give you an example.

00:01:28.678 --> 00:01:33.238
People from Latin America have reputation for being very warm and friendly people.

00:01:34.108 --> 00:01:38.008
The people seem happier and enjoy life more in Latin American countries.

00:01:38.458 --> 00:01:44.308
It's easier to make friends in a Latin American country, or at least that's what they say.

00:01:45.348 --> 00:01:47.713
I've talked to hundreds of people from Latin America,

00:01:47.713 --> 00:01:49.543
and most of them have told me the same thing,

00:01:50.563 --> 00:01:53.443
"Americans are so much colder than we are."

00:01:54.193 --> 00:01:56.593
"You Americans are so serious all the time."

00:01:57.913 --> 00:02:00.163
Although I think that's a question of opinion,

00:02:00.733 --> 00:02:04.063
I still think there may be some truth to that depending on the situation.

00:02:04.573 --> 00:02:05.803
But there are a few problems here.

00:02:06.643 --> 00:02:09.763
Number one, not all Americans are the same.

00:02:11.053 --> 00:02:12.983
We have to acknowledge the fact that the U.S.

00:02:13.003 --> 00:02:15.013
is a gigantic country.

00:02:16.033 --> 00:02:20.533
There are over 300 million people in this country.

00:02:21.253 --> 00:02:24.793
And within that group of 300 million, there are many sub-groups.

00:02:25.383 --> 00:02:29.803
Black people, white people, Africans, Latinos, Asians, Europeans,

00:02:30.043 --> 00:02:34.183
and within those subgroups, there are many more subgroups, right?

00:02:34.363 --> 00:02:36.223
The rich blacks, the poor blacks,

00:02:36.403 --> 00:02:38.593
blacks from the south blacks from up north,

00:02:38.863 --> 00:02:40.513
the rich whites, the poor whites,

00:02:40.633 --> 00:02:42.673
the liberal whites, the conservative whites,

00:02:42.883 --> 00:02:45.223
African-Americans, foreign Africans,

00:02:45.223 --> 00:02:47.743
Ethiopians, Kenyans, Moroccans, Egyptians,

00:02:47.953 --> 00:02:50.323
American Latinos, foreign Latinos,

00:02:50.503 --> 00:02:53.223
Hondurans, Colombians, Mexicans, Nicaraguans,

00:02:53.508 --> 00:02:55.578
American Asians, foreign Asians,

00:02:55.578 --> 00:02:58.608
the Chinese, the Japanese, Korean, Filipino, Vietnamese.

00:02:58.788 --> 00:03:01.578
And let's not forget the native Americans, right?

00:03:02.718 --> 00:03:06.498
All of these people in all of these groups are a part of the United States of America.

00:03:07.218 --> 00:03:10.218
And all of these people come from different walks of life.

00:03:11.598 --> 00:03:16.218
All these people were raised inside their own version of American culture.

00:03:17.928 --> 00:03:21.218
For example, there are many types of black Americans culture.

00:03:22.198 --> 00:03:24.803
There are many types of white American culture,

00:03:25.073 --> 00:03:26.573
as well as African-American,

00:03:26.723 --> 00:03:29.093
which is not the same thing as black American,

00:03:29.513 --> 00:03:31.793
also Latino American, and Asian-American.

00:03:33.323 --> 00:03:35.933
We're all the same and yet completely different,

00:03:36.653 --> 00:03:39.443
just like everyone else from every other country in the world.

00:03:40.883 --> 00:03:44.403
So when you say, "Americans are so bah, bah, bah..."

00:03:45.383 --> 00:03:47.253
to which Americans are you really referring?

00:03:48.493 --> 00:03:49.243
Do you even know?

00:03:50.913 --> 00:03:54.743
Most of the time, it's the Americans that you see on TV and social media.

00:03:55.203 --> 00:03:59.213
It's the pop culture stars, the actors, the politicians, the athletes,

00:03:59.363 --> 00:04:01.373
the YouTube and TikTok influencers.

00:04:02.363 --> 00:04:09.263
But that relatively small group of people can not and will not ever represent the entire United States of America.

00:04:10.433 --> 00:04:13.313
Such a minority could never represent the majority.

00:04:15.053 --> 00:04:19.133
Problem number two, 'cold' is a subjective word.

00:04:20.233 --> 00:04:24.578
Another thing we must take into consideration is that the word cold is subjective.

00:04:25.598 --> 00:04:28.268
What's cold to me, may not be cold to you.

00:04:29.348 --> 00:04:33.818
As a Latin American, you might think you're being very warm, friendly, and funny

00:04:34.028 --> 00:04:37.448
while I, as an American might think you're being fake as fuck.

00:04:39.388 --> 00:04:42.178
I might think that you're just smiling and acting like my friend

00:04:42.418 --> 00:04:46.728
because you're trying to give me a certain impression of who you are or because you want something from me.

00:04:47.788 --> 00:04:51.658
I might think you're trying to force the feeling of friendship and connection onto me.

00:04:53.358 --> 00:04:55.258
There are many ways to interpret the same behavior,

00:04:55.438 --> 00:05:00.988
and many times we interpret other people's behavior through the lens of how we would behave.

00:05:01.888 --> 00:05:07.588
That's not always a good idea because we are not other people and other people are not us.

00:05:08.818 --> 00:05:12.238
And you might think Americans are extremely cold and unapproachable,

00:05:12.358 --> 00:05:15.558
but I think that the people you're referring to are not cold.

00:05:16.138 --> 00:05:17.323
They simply are not fake.

00:05:18.943 --> 00:05:24.343
We're just not the type of people to meet someone for the first time and immediately act like we've known them for years.

00:05:25.483 --> 00:05:30.613
Now, in this case, when I say 'we' I'm talking about myself and the people in some of the places where I grew up.

00:05:31.273 --> 00:05:34.123
However, I've also grown up in places where people are,

00:05:34.123 --> 00:05:37.843
what you might think of as really nice and friendly,

00:05:37.993 --> 00:05:41.243
when in reality they're just fake and they only care about appearances.

00:05:42.413 --> 00:05:47.468
It's something that's hard to explain to someone who isn't from here because of the difference of culture.

00:05:48.668 --> 00:05:51.278
Just like in your country or state or city,

00:05:51.458 --> 00:05:55.688
I'm sure that you're aware of cultural behaviors that I would never notice as a foreigner

00:05:56.018 --> 00:05:59.738
because I'd be seeing your world through the lens of my culture.

00:06:00.608 --> 00:06:01.478
That's just the way it is.

00:06:02.138 --> 00:06:07.848
And when I say culture, I'm really talking about my history as a human being, all of my life experiences.

00:06:08.703 --> 00:06:11.973
Those are the things that create and mold my perspective.

00:06:13.143 --> 00:06:17.343
Another example of people who have a reputation for being cold is Russian people.

00:06:18.303 --> 00:06:20.973
So many people from around the world, including Americans,

00:06:21.273 --> 00:06:26.703
have told me that they think Russians are crazy, extremely cold and difficult to approach.

00:06:27.633 --> 00:06:32.193
However, my experience with Russian people has been the exact opposite.

00:06:33.183 --> 00:06:35.823
I've never met a Russian person that I did not like...

00:06:36.833 --> 00:06:37.163
ever.

00:06:38.283 --> 00:06:42.053
I've never met a Russian person and felt like they were cold at all.

00:06:43.163 --> 00:06:46.673
The Russian people I've met are some of the coolest people on the planet actually.

00:06:47.363 --> 00:06:51.863
However, another person from another country might interpret their behavior as cold,

00:06:52.163 --> 00:06:55.043
and it would be hard for them to make friends with those same Russian people.

00:06:56.003 --> 00:07:00.203
So I think part of your interactions with people depends on how you perceive the people.

00:07:01.313 --> 00:07:05.138
If you enter the situation with preconceived notions about who these people are,

00:07:05.348 --> 00:07:10.298
it will inevitably have some effect on the way you interpret their actions and the way you treat them.

00:07:11.318 --> 00:07:12.968
This is what I call projecting.

00:07:13.928 --> 00:07:18.008
You're taking your internal vision of who someone is and putting it on them,

00:07:18.368 --> 00:07:22.168
instead of letting them show you who they actually are without being judged.

00:07:23.968 --> 00:07:31.543
When you do this, you're likely to misinterpret all kinds of things
and reinforce all kinds of inaccurate beliefs that you already have.

00:07:32.593 --> 00:07:38.803
However, if you would've just taken the time to understand their culture and behavior just a little bit better,

00:07:39.043 --> 00:07:41.263
not from your perspective, but from theirs,

00:07:41.653 --> 00:07:44.113
you might see that they aren't cold at all.

00:07:44.893 --> 00:07:48.193
They just have a different way of communicating and forming relationships.

00:07:50.243 --> 00:07:50.983
Problem number three.

00:07:51.988 --> 00:07:55.888
Maybe, if you understood the reason for the difference in cultural behavior,

00:07:56.098 --> 00:08:02.128
you would find a way to adapt and still make great friendships with the people you thought were cold and unapproachable.

00:08:02.308 --> 00:08:03.868
Now, technically that's not a problem.

00:08:04.138 --> 00:08:04.978
That's a statement.

00:08:05.248 --> 00:08:08.908
But subject number three or observation, number three, let's say it that way.

00:08:10.468 --> 00:08:14.158
You need to understand the culture and the mindset of the people you're communicating with.

00:08:15.148 --> 00:08:20.238
I'm not saying you must adopt the culture or the mindset of those people, but you need to understand it.

00:08:21.148 --> 00:08:25.423
Your understanding of things dictates your perceptions and behavior, right?

00:08:26.233 --> 00:08:31.033
So the better, your understanding of people is, the better your interactions with those people will be.

00:08:31.663 --> 00:08:34.093
And I am, of course, speaking in general terms.

00:08:35.203 --> 00:08:38.983
People spend so much time focused on the technical aspects of language,

00:08:38.983 --> 00:08:43.273
like grammar, vocabulary, words, pronunciation, et cetera.

00:08:43.693 --> 00:08:47.113
Now, of course, those things are really important when you're trying to learn a language.

00:08:47.763 --> 00:08:55.903
However, it seems to me that a lot of people don't understand that it's culture that dictates how the language is used.

00:08:56.563 --> 00:09:01.933
So if you want to sound like a native or make friends with natives, work with natives,

00:09:02.383 --> 00:09:06.283
you must understand how their culture influences their communication style.

00:09:07.633 --> 00:09:10.663
You don't have to change who you are just to make friends or be understood,

00:09:10.893 --> 00:09:17.893
but being able to adapt your communication style to the current situation is a very valuable skill to have.

00:09:20.283 --> 00:09:20.913
Number four...

00:09:21.813 --> 00:09:22.263
I think.

00:09:23.523 --> 00:09:27.003
Maybe these people that you see as cold and unapproachable,

00:09:27.603 --> 00:09:31.733
maybe, just maybe they don't like you.

00:09:33.873 --> 00:09:36.183
You have to agree that it's a possibility, right?

00:09:36.363 --> 00:09:41.583
All those people that you think are super cold and rude or mean, or whatever it is,

00:09:41.613 --> 00:09:45.483
maybe they don't like you, maybe it's just, you.

00:09:46.803 --> 00:09:47.373
It's possible.

00:09:48.663 --> 00:09:50.703
I remember I was talking to this girl from Ecuador,

00:09:51.213 --> 00:09:55.023
and she was helping me with my Spanish and I was helping her with her English.

00:09:55.443 --> 00:10:00.633
And when we first started talking, everything she said was like, so full of energy and emotion.

00:10:00.633 --> 00:10:04.018
It was actually quite intoxicating at first, you know, I liked it.

00:10:04.348 --> 00:10:09.238
It was a pleasure to talk to someone who seemed to be so full of life and so charismatic, you know?

00:10:09.988 --> 00:10:12.178
It didn't really feel fake or forced at all.

00:10:12.958 --> 00:10:17.878
However, after a day or two, I noticed that she was like that all the time.

00:10:19.493 --> 00:10:25.073
Putting so much energy and emotion into every word exaggerating at times,

00:10:25.283 --> 00:10:30.983
you know, making the most mundane sentences and ideas sound extraordinary and extremely important.

00:10:32.213 --> 00:10:35.453
After a while, it started to feel very fake and very forced.

00:10:36.953 --> 00:10:39.173
"There's no way she's like this all the time."

00:10:39.413 --> 00:10:40.313
I thought to myself.

00:10:41.783 --> 00:10:43.703
The problem was that I simply didn't know.

00:10:44.503 --> 00:10:50.143
I hadn't had much experience with Ecuadorian people and I hadn't had much experience with her, the individual.

00:10:50.803 --> 00:10:55.873
So I really couldn't come to any conclusions about who she was or why she behaved the way she did.

00:10:57.013 --> 00:11:02.063
Then we had our first video call and she had that same over-the-top,

00:11:02.083 --> 00:11:06.733
always excited, always joking, always happy to be here, type of energy, you know?

00:11:07.903 --> 00:11:12.143
And that smile, that type of smile that looked forced to me, you know what I'm saying?

00:11:12.843 --> 00:11:18.718
And she was trying to like tell jokes and create a friendly atmosphere in the first few minutes of the call and things like that.

00:11:19.108 --> 00:11:23.578
And although I see nothing wrong with that, it's just not the way I do things, you know?

00:11:24.088 --> 00:11:33.328
I'm not the type of person to force a relationship or go out of my way to
show someone that I'm happy, engaged, approachable, or anything like that.

00:11:34.588 --> 00:11:37.498
If something isn't funny, I'm not going to laugh.

00:11:38.398 --> 00:11:41.278
If I don't have a reason to smile, I don't smile.

00:11:42.313 --> 00:11:45.553
If I don't have anything to say, then I don't speak.

00:11:46.723 --> 00:11:47.593
That's just the way I am.

00:11:48.703 --> 00:11:53.323
So after this girl tried to make a few jokes, she noticed this about me and she said,

00:11:53.953 --> 00:11:56.003
"Man, you Americans are really serious no?"

00:11:57.163 --> 00:12:00.673
And I responded, "No, you're just not funny."

00:12:02.093 --> 00:12:05.043
I could see in her face that she wasn't expecting me to say something like that.

00:12:05.253 --> 00:12:07.023
And maybe it hurt her feelings, I'm not sure.

00:12:07.353 --> 00:12:16.893
But the reason I told you that story is to illustrate the point that we were two very different
people from two very different countries, and we both interpreted our behavior in different ways.

00:12:17.793 --> 00:12:21.633
I'm not saying which interpretation was right or wrong or better or worse.

00:12:21.903 --> 00:12:25.143
I'm just saying that she thought I was being cold and serious,

00:12:25.293 --> 00:12:26.593
and I thought she was being fake.

00:12:28.133 --> 00:12:30.748
The truth is most likely that neither of those things were true.

00:12:31.468 --> 00:12:33.748
It was probably just a cultural misunderstanding

00:12:33.898 --> 00:12:38.188
or maybe an individual misunderstanding that had nothing to do with our culture.

00:12:39.568 --> 00:12:45.178
It's the type of misunderstanding that happens every day when we don't take the time to understand that people were talking to,

00:12:45.658 --> 00:12:49.958
and instead we simply make assumptions based on what we think we already know.

00:12:51.483 --> 00:12:54.693
Then we see the entire world through this lens of our assumptions,

00:12:54.843 --> 00:12:57.303
which only reinforces the assumptions we've made,

00:12:57.453 --> 00:12:59.943
because when you're looking for something, you're going to find it.

00:13:01.023 --> 00:13:04.803
In other words, if you believe that all people from a certain place are this way,

00:13:05.253 --> 00:13:10.053
you're naturally going to look for examples that confirm and reinforce that belief

00:13:10.503 --> 00:13:13.203
and ignore the cases that contradict that belief.

00:13:14.343 --> 00:13:17.973
And that's what I mean by making observations without context.

00:13:19.283 --> 00:13:23.058
We all have these ideas about the way the world works and the way people are,

00:13:23.358 --> 00:13:30.138
but most of the time, our ideas are just assumptions, not conclusions based on context or facts.

00:13:31.818 --> 00:13:36.378
All of these assumptions affect the way we talk, the way we interact, the places we go,

00:13:36.378 --> 00:13:42.078
the things we believe, the fears and insecurities we have, they affect everything we think and do.

00:13:43.308 --> 00:13:45.588
So I challenge you to take a moment and ask yourself:

00:13:47.073 --> 00:13:50.373
Are you seeing the world through your eyes or through your culture?

1
00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:05.300
I'm not sure if you know this or not, but weed is now legal in the state of Georgia.

2
00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:09.220
And I'm not talking about the weed we buy in the street from our local drug dealers.

3
00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:12.530
I'm talking about something called Delta-8 THC.

4
00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:17.040
For those of you that don't know, let me quickly explain what THC is.

5
00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:27.460
THC stands for Tetrahydrocannabinol or Delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol or simply Delta-9 THC.

6
00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:33.110
However, most people know it as THC. And this is the main active ingredient in marijuana.

7
00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:36.810
And it's known... Excuse me, it's most famous for getting people high.

8
00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:41.890
So when you hear THC, just think the chemical in marijuana that gets you high.

9
00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:49.530
In the last year or two another form of THC, Delta-8 not Delta-9,

10
00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:53.720
But Delta-8 has become very popular due to a loophole in legislation

11
00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:58.170
Regarding the cultivation and sale of the cannabis or marijuana plant.

12
00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:02.720
Now I found an article that perfectly sums up what Delta-8 THC is,

13
00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:06.310
How it's different from the classic Delta-9, why it's legal,

14
00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:09.450
And even where you can buy it. So I'm going to read that article to you now.

15
00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:13.100
If you're watching this on YouTube, you can read along with me if you like.

16
00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:18.190
And I'll also put a link to the article in the description of this episode. All right?

17
00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:25.030
So here we go. I got this article from cfah.org and if I'm not mistaken,

18
00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:30.050
CFAH stands for Center for Advancing Health. All right? And the ti...

19
00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:32.770
Excuse me, the title of the article is.

20
00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:38.520
"What is Delta-8 THC? Everything you need to know about this cannabinoid". All right?

21
00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.880
So here we go. I'm not going to read the whole article.

22
00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:45.180
I'm going to skip certain parts that aren't really relevant to this episode or what I'm trying to tell you.

23
00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:50.260
So just so you're not confused if you're actually watching this on YouTube. All right? But here we go.

24
00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:57.100
When you hear people talking about THC, they usually mean the Delta-9 version,

25
00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:00.560
Which is the main intoxicating compound in cannabis plants.

26
00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:04.500
But it's not the only type of THC that the cannabis plant can make.

27
00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:10.940
In fact, there are several different analogs of Delta-9. One of them being Delta-8 THC.

28
00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:16.180
Now, really quickly, just in case you don't know the word 'analog' is referring to a person

29
00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:21.480
Or a thing seen as comparable to another, something that's similar to something else.

30
00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:26.430
So an analog of Delta-9 is something comparable or similar to Delta-9.

31
00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:29.360
And in this case, that would be Delta-8 THC. Ok?

32
00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:35.700
So this newer, trendier cannabinoid is known for a milder psychoactive experience

33
00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:39.700
On top of providing many similar health benefits to its more potent cousin.

34
00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:46.600
Just like most cannabis products, Delta-8 THC can be found in tinctures, gummies, vapes, and concentrates.

35
00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:52.260
In this article, you'll learn everything there is to know about the latest trend in the cannabis space.

36
00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:59.710
So what exactly is Delta-8 THC? Delta-8 THC is an analog of the Delta-9 compound.

37
00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:04.520
These molecules are built similarly, but the arrangement of their atomic bonds is different,

38
00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:06.650
Which also causes them to have different properties.

39
00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:13.410
In recent months, Delta-8 THC has made big headlines in the industry's press as the "legal high".

40
00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:20.100
It's also been dubbed as "diet weed" or "cannabis lite" due to less potent cognitive effects.

41
00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:25.780
The strength of Delta-8 THC is about half as high as the one of Delta-9.

42
00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:29.690
The compound is also less likely to cause anxiety and paranoia.

43
00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:34.420
Two of the side effects of taking two high doses of THC-rich weed strains.

44
00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:40.500
Delta-8 THC comes in many forms, just like CBD and Delta-9 THC.

45
00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:43.090
Now, for those of you that are wondering what CBD is,

46
00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:49.820
I'll explain that really quickly as well. So according to health.harvard.edu CBD

47
00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:55.240
Or cannabidiol is the second most prevalent active ingredient in cannabis or marijuana.

48
00:03:55.870 --> 00:04:01.470
While CBD is an essential component of medical marijuana, it is derived directly from the hemp plant.

49
00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:06.700
A cousin of marijuana. Or manufactured in a laboratory.

50
00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:12.810
One of hundreds of components in marijuana, CBD does not cause a high by itself.

51
00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:17.320
According to a report from the World Health Organization, which can not be trusted,

52
00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:23.250
In humans, CBD exhibits no effects indicative of any abuse or dependence potential.

53
00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:31.210
To date or up until this point, there is no evidence of public health-related problems associated with the use of pure CBD.

54
00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:36.660
So in summary, CBD is another component of the marijuana plant or the hemp plant,

55
00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:40.450
in this case, That doesn't get you high but still has many health benefits.

56
00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:44.680
So just consuming CBD isn't going to get you high. All right? That's the idea.

57
00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:53.890
So back to the article. Delta-8 THC comes in many forms, just like CBD and Delta-9 THC.

58
00:04:54.400 --> 00:05:00.770
You can find it in vapes, tinctures, gummies, capsules, concentrates, distillates, and even pre-rolled joints.

59
00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:06.760
Some of the health benefits of Delta-8 THC are reduced stress and anxiety, deeper sleep,

60
00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:11.980
Lower pain and inflammation, less nausea and vomiting, elevated mood,

61
00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:16.410
Neuroprotective properties, whatever that means. Boost of appetite,

62
00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:21.150
And anti-cancer properties, whatever the hell that means. I mean, I know what they mean.

63
00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:24.190
Neuroprotective properties are things that protect something in your brain.

64
00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:27.480
When you hear 'neuro' you can think brain, but I don't know what those properties are

65
00:05:27.890 --> 00:05:29.390
Or what exactly they mean when they say that.

66
00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:33.240
Anti-cancer properties, I imagine, are things that help prevent cancer.

67
00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:35.760
But I don't know if that's true. I don't know how that works.

68
00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:41.240
So I can't say for sure if Delta-8 THC actually helps prevent cancer.

69
00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:44.100
But that's what the article says. So we'll leave it like that. All right?

70
00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:51.330
Now, what does Delta-8 THC feel like? The effects of Delta-8 THC are less trippy,

71
00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:55.160
More clearheaded, and lightweight compared to Delta-9 THC.

72
00:05:55.950 --> 00:05:58.610
The effects aren't as cerebral as with normal weed.

73
00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:02.450
The high rather focuses on the body rather than the head.

74
00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:07.020
Now, I don't know who wrote this article or who wrote it like that for this reason,

75
00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:10.670
But to have the word 'rather' twice in that sentence sounds strange to me.

76
00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:14.760
I wouldn't say "the high rather focuses on the body rather than the head".

77
00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:19.620
It's redundant to me. I would say "the high focuses on the body rather than the head".

78
00:06:19.620 --> 00:06:23.010
That's totally fine. But just so you know, okay? So let's continue.

79
00:06:24.090 --> 00:06:30.180
The strength of the cognitive effects provided by Delta THC or excuse me, Delta-8 THC is dose dependent.

80
00:06:30.870 --> 00:06:35.050
Lower doses such as five milligrams or ten milligrams are mildly stimulating

81
00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:38.990
And help boost energy on top of enhancing focus and elevating mood.

82
00:06:39.700 --> 00:06:46.270
Those who take Delta-8 THC, I said Delta H. I meant Delta eight. It's hard to say. Delta-8 THC.

83
00:06:47.850 --> 00:06:55.630
Anyway, those who take Delta-8 THC in low amounts also report improved stress response and lower anxiety levels.

84
00:06:56.340 --> 00:07:01.450
Higher doses, ten milligrams to thirty milligrams can trigger mild intoxication.

85
00:07:02.310 --> 00:07:06.060
Anything upwards is likely to induce sedation and make you feel drowsy.

86
00:07:06.940 --> 00:07:11.150
The high from Delta-8 THC is often described as bland when taken alone.

87
00:07:11.900 --> 00:07:14.810
You feel the buzz, but it gets you in no particular direction,

88
00:07:15.060 --> 00:07:20.220
Which is why most users take it alongside CBD or other cannabinoid and terpenes.

89
00:07:20.650 --> 00:07:24.680
Now this word 'terpenes', I did some research before I started recording this

90
00:07:25.540 --> 00:07:28.150
And I still don't totally understand what they are.

91
00:07:28.150 --> 00:07:34.920
But what I do understand from my research is that terpenes in marijuana, in this plant are what give the plant its smell.

92
00:07:35.270 --> 00:07:39.650
So if you're familiar with weed at all, you might know that there are many different strains of weed.

93
00:07:39.650 --> 00:07:42.320
It's not just weed, there are many different kinds that you can smoke.

94
00:07:42.320 --> 00:07:44.550
And they all have different effects and different smells.

95
00:07:44.850 --> 00:07:49.200
And the terpenes are what give each particular strain of weed its particular smell.

96
00:07:49.860 --> 00:07:53.940
That's what I understood, but I don't know if that's 100% true, so don't quote me on that. Okay?

97
00:07:54.600 --> 00:08:00.360
So let's continue. Other possible ways of incorporating... I can't talk today, bro. What the fuck?

98
00:08:00.870 --> 00:08:07.510
Other possible ways of incorporating Delta-8 THC into your daily routine is to mix it with tea

99
00:08:07.820 --> 00:08:13.040
Or coffee to enhance focus or with melatonin to boost sleep. All right?

100
00:08:13.790 --> 00:08:17.490
Now I'm going to skip over the highlights on the effects of Delta-8 THC.

101
00:08:18.050 --> 00:08:22.110
And then it starts to talk about the best places you can buy Delta-8 THC.

102
00:08:22.110 --> 00:08:28.640
I'm going to skip over that as well and go to "Is Delta-8 THC legal?".

103
00:08:29.420 --> 00:08:35.000
Now, in theory, Delta-8 THC is legal on the federal level thanks to the 2018 Farm Bill.

104
00:08:35.540 --> 00:08:40.280
But the actual legal status of Delta-8 products remains in a bit of a legal gray area.

105
00:08:40.330 --> 00:08:43.670
So there are two things I want to explain. The first one is gray area.

106
00:08:44.680 --> 00:08:50.120
A gray area is an area in which things are not very clear, things are open to interpretation.

107
00:08:50.450 --> 00:08:54.290
Because... This is how you can think about it. You have, let's say,

108
00:08:54.290 --> 00:08:59.610
A black square and a white square right next to each other. Black and white,

109
00:08:59.880 --> 00:09:02.650
If you think about it, are exact opposites. So if you put them next to each other,

110
00:09:02.650 --> 00:09:05.420
It's easy to see where black stops and where white starts.

111
00:09:05.810 --> 00:09:10.190
There's a clear distinction between the two. But if I let those two squares overlap,

112
00:09:11.650 --> 00:09:15.630
The part where they overlap is going to be gray because black plus white is gray. You see what I'm saying?

113
00:09:15.630 --> 00:09:18.260
So it's clear where black is. It's clear where white is.

114
00:09:18.300 --> 00:09:21.680
But right there in the middle, it's not very clear where black starts and white stops.

115
00:09:22.220 --> 00:09:26.960
That's the gray area where things aren't very clear. They're not black and white, as we say sometimes.

116
00:09:27.370 --> 00:09:32.870
So back into the context of legislation, legality, law, and stuff like that.

117
00:09:33.540 --> 00:09:36.920
The legal gray area is that area when you're interpreting a law,

118
00:09:37.470 --> 00:09:40.410
It's not exactly clear what's legal and illegal.

119
00:09:40.920 --> 00:09:44.220
Because you can interpret the language of the law in many different ways.

120
00:09:44.220 --> 00:09:48.320
So maybe this thing is legal, but if I do it in this way over here,

121
00:09:48.320 --> 00:09:53.450
It's not necessarily illegal anymore. You see what I'm saying? Because it's in that gray area.

122
00:09:53.830 --> 00:09:57.590
You could do it a couple of different ways. You could find a loophole, right?

123
00:09:58.410 --> 00:10:03.550
In the law that allows you to still do this technically illegal thing in a way that's technically not illegal.

124
00:10:04.330 --> 00:10:05.990
Ok, that was a long explanation. But hopefully,

125
00:10:05.990 --> 00:10:10.880
Now you understand what someone means to say when they refer to what we call "The gray area".

126
00:10:11.250 --> 00:10:14.670
Now, the second thing I wanted to explain was the 2018 Farm Bill.

127
00:10:14.670 --> 00:10:18.210
So let me pull that up really quick. Here we go.

128
00:10:19.940 --> 00:10:24.260
The Farm Bill is a package of legislation passed roughly once every five years

129
00:10:24.260 --> 00:10:28.340
That has a tremendous impact on farming livelihoods, how food is grown,

130
00:10:28.370 --> 00:10:33.300
And what kind of foods are grown. So now I'm going to go to fda.gov.

131
00:10:34.300 --> 00:10:39.770
And according to this website, it says, In December of 2018, the 2018 Farm Bill was signed into law,

132
00:10:40.280 --> 00:10:47.500
it removed hemp, defined as cannabis and derivatives of cannabis with extremely low concentrations of

133
00:10:47.500 --> 00:10:52.140
THC from the definition of marijuana in the Controlled Substances Act.

134
00:10:52.410 --> 00:10:57.160
So in plain English, what that means is, back in 2018 president Trump signed a bill,

135
00:10:57.560 --> 00:11:00.960
The 2018 Farm Bill, that changed the definition of marijuana.

136
00:11:00.960 --> 00:11:04.340
Because marijuana is illegal, but since he changed the definition,

137
00:11:05.210 --> 00:11:11.280
Products that are derived from the hemp plant that have less than 0.3% active THC which gets you high,

138
00:11:11.280 --> 00:11:14.920
Are not considered illegal anymore. That's a very important distinction

139
00:11:14.920 --> 00:11:20.690
And that's why people can sell Delta-8 THC products. That's the idea. Okay?

140
00:11:21.680 --> 00:11:27.990
So back to the article. No federal agency has explicitly prohibited Delta-8 THC,

141
00:11:28.400 --> 00:11:33.630
But current manufacturing methods leave enough space for interpretation of its legality. Like I was saying earlier.

142
00:11:34.610 --> 00:11:38.390
So here are some key points on the legality of Delta-8 THC.

143
00:11:38.970 --> 00:11:44.860
The first one, Delta-9 is clearly banned as an illegal substance under federal regulations.

144
00:11:45.460 --> 00:11:50.390
That being said, individual states can regulate THC and cannabis products on their own.

145
00:11:50.970 --> 00:11:55.380
And currently, Delta-8 THC is legal in 16 states for recreational use.

146
00:11:55.640 --> 00:11:59.130
So in plain English, the classic Delta-9 is federally illegal.

147
00:11:59.390 --> 00:12:06.440
However, in the U.S., each of the 50 states reserved the right to decide how they want to handle this law,

148
00:12:06.510 --> 00:12:09.270
Which is why you can go to a state like Colorado or California,

149
00:12:09.710 --> 00:12:13.940
Smoke as much weed as you want as long as you're 21. The same thing as buying a beer, right?

150
00:12:13.940 --> 00:12:20.100
But in Texas or Alabama or something like that, if you get caught smoking weed in public, you are going to jail.

151
00:12:20.350 --> 00:12:23.750
You understand? It's black and white in these places. You see what I'm saying?

152
00:12:23.750 --> 00:12:26.090
So it depends... Federally, it's illegal.

153
00:12:26.090 --> 00:12:31.390
But on the state level, sometimes it is, sometimes it's not. It's a little confusing, right?

154
00:12:32.200 --> 00:12:39.450
So Delta-8 THC is federally legal, but some states have banned the sale of Delta-8 THC products.

155
00:12:40.420 --> 00:12:45.650
Delta-8 is usually extracted from hemp, the plant, which is legal in all 50 states,

156
00:12:45.650 --> 00:12:49.530
Provided that it contains no more than 0.3% of THC.

157
00:12:50.200 --> 00:12:53.240
So hemp-derived products are legal in all 50 states.

158
00:12:54.440 --> 00:13:00.840
Delta-8 THC is made by converting CBD into Delta-9 and then into Delta-8.

159
00:13:01.940 --> 00:13:05.560
According to this article. I haven't confirmed that. So don't quote me on that. Okay?

160
00:13:06.300 --> 00:13:12.340
Now, synthetic extraction of THC is considered illegal, which may or may not affect the legal status of

161
00:13:12.380 --> 00:13:18.410
Delta-8 THC products that use chemical processes on their way to converting Delta-9 into Delta-8.

162
00:13:18.920 --> 00:13:22.440
Now, all of this might start to sound a little confusing if you know nothing about weed

163
00:13:22.440 --> 00:13:25.320
And you're not interested in the chemical compounds and how it works.

164
00:13:26.250 --> 00:13:31.520
But just understand that really this whole THC thing that I'm explaining now isn't even the point of the episode,

165
00:13:31.520 --> 00:13:33.300
But I am telling you for a reason. Ok?

166
00:13:33.300 --> 00:13:37.690
So just continue to follow me and you'll see why I'm telling you this very shortly. All right?

167
00:13:38.600 --> 00:13:43.090
So as I said before, President Trump signed the amended Farm Bill in 2018,

168
00:13:43.090 --> 00:13:46.150
Which legalized hemp and its derivatives in all 50 states,

169
00:13:46.200 --> 00:13:50.420
As long as they contain less than 0.3% of Delta-9 THC. Okay?

170
00:13:50.920 --> 00:13:56.220
Any product with the THC content higher than that figure is considered marijuana and federally illegal.

171
00:13:56.570 --> 00:14:01.170
Although as mentioned, individual states can have their own laws regarding marijuana.

172
00:14:02.100 --> 00:14:05.430
However, none of these laws mentioned Delta-8 THC.

173
00:14:05.810 --> 00:14:08.760
Here in the article, it says Delta-9, but I'm pretty sure they meant Delta-8.

174
00:14:09.630 --> 00:14:16.790
So hemp-derived Delta-8 THC products remain in compliance with the guidelines outlined in the 2018 Farm Bill,

175
00:14:16.790 --> 00:14:21.030
So they should be legal in all 50 states. But similarly to marijuana laws,

176
00:14:21.200 --> 00:14:26.550
Individual states may refuse to fully accept the federal regulations establishing their own rules.

177
00:14:27.280 --> 00:14:30.920
To date, 14 states have passed bills that have specifically banned

178
00:14:31.340 --> 00:14:38.440
Or prohibited Delta-8 THC products including Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, Colorado, Delaware,

179
00:14:38.660 --> 00:14:45.700
Idaho, Iowa, Kentucky, Mississippi, Montana, New York, Vermont, Rhode Island, and Utah.

180
00:14:46.010 --> 00:14:48.470
God damn, we got a lot of states in this country, man.

181
00:14:48.840 --> 00:14:53.360
14 states have specifically banned Delta-8 THC. That's the idea.

182
00:14:53.850 --> 00:14:56.980
So then the article goes on to talk about how much you should take. I'm skipping that.

183
00:14:57.750 --> 00:15:01.550
The different dosage recommendations for different weight groups. So I'm skipping that too.

184
00:15:02.560 --> 00:15:05.010
Can you build a tolerance to Delta eight? I'm skipping that.

185
00:15:05.500 --> 00:15:09.960
Now, the last thing I believe in this article I wanted to show you was the Delta-8 THC products.

186
00:15:09.960 --> 00:15:14.480
How can you consume Delta-8 and not Delta-9? So here we go.

187
00:15:15.300 --> 00:15:19.450
Scientists have been investigating the effects of Delta-8 THC since the '70s

188
00:15:19.910 --> 00:15:24.320
But only in recent months the cannabinoid has received so much attention from the hemp industry.

189
00:15:24.980 --> 00:15:28.220
This mostly happened thanks to the advancements in extraction technologies,

190
00:15:28.430 --> 00:15:33.160
Which now make it possible for manufacturers to extract Delta-8 THC from hemp plants.

191
00:15:33.860 --> 00:15:41.160
Products sourced from marijuana strains that have... I read that wrong, give me a second. Ah okay. Okay.

192
00:15:41.470 --> 00:15:44.940
Products sourced from marijuana aren't a good fit for everyone.

193
00:15:45.570 --> 00:15:49.680
Many people who are sensitive to its intoxicating effects find the high too heavy,

194
00:15:50.100 --> 00:15:51.920
Especially when it comes to cerebral effects.

195
00:15:52.560 --> 00:15:57.100
Some users may experience anxiety and paranoia on top of confusion and dizziness.

196
00:15:57.870 --> 00:16:03.580
These are the most common reasons why some cannabis aficionados choose to avoid high THC products.

197
00:16:04.510 --> 00:16:09.470
The sudden emergence of Delta-8 in the market has provided the answer to their prayers.

198
00:16:10.340 --> 00:16:15.100
Delta-8 THC products are available in similar categories to all cannabis products,

199
00:16:15.140 --> 00:16:19.150
Including tinctures, edibles, vapes, concentrates, capsules, and more.

200
00:16:19.560 --> 00:16:22.810
So here we break down the five most common Delta-8 formats.

201
00:16:23.090 --> 00:16:26.400
Number one, Delta-8 THC tinctures.

202
00:16:27.430 --> 00:16:32.070
So what is a tincture? What is a tincture, Tony? Good question.

203
00:16:35.760 --> 00:16:38.810
For most people, cannabis tinctures equal CBD oil.

204
00:16:39.410 --> 00:16:44.000
The hemp-derived extract used by people who want to reap the benefits from cannabis but without getting high.

205
00:16:44.740 --> 00:16:47.390
Delta-8 THC is available in the same convenient form.

206
00:16:48.070 --> 00:16:52.500
The advantages of this format include precise dosing, high bioavailability,

207
00:16:52.500 --> 00:16:55.920
Fast onset, and relatively long duration of effects.

208
00:16:56.440 --> 00:17:00.030
Now, it wasn't my plan to get deep into what each of these things are.

209
00:17:00.030 --> 00:17:03.770
Like, I really had no knowledge of tinctures before I started doing research today,

210
00:17:04.240 --> 00:17:06.940
But let me just show you a picture because that's much easier.

211
00:17:07.510 --> 00:17:14.000
So delta eight. I think it's this one. No, that's not it. Here we go.

212
00:17:14.060 --> 00:17:17.710
If you're watching this on YouTube, you can see a picture now of a Delta-8 tincture.

213
00:17:17.710 --> 00:17:20.950
It's some kind of oil and to be honest, I'm not sure what you do with it.

214
00:17:21.260 --> 00:17:25.870
I'm not sure if you consume it like, you put drops on your tongue or you put it in something else.

215
00:17:26.450 --> 00:17:28.410
I really don't know. I would have to do research,

216
00:17:28.430 --> 00:17:32.400
But at least you can see what they're referring to when they use the word 'tincture'.

217
00:17:32.400 --> 00:17:33.740
It's some kind of oil, ok?

218
00:17:33.740 --> 00:17:38.530
Let's move on to the next product, which is Delta-8 THC gummies.

219
00:17:39.400 --> 00:17:42.420
Edibles are another common group of Delta-8 THC products,

220
00:17:42.740 --> 00:17:46.290
And the most popular form of Delta-8 THC edibles is gummies.

221
00:17:46.340 --> 00:17:52.130
So now you can see here on the screen a perfect example of Delta-8 THC gummies.

222
00:17:52.150 --> 00:17:55.860
So these little pieces of candy right here, if you eat enough of them, will get you high as fuck,

223
00:17:56.420 --> 00:17:59.120
Just like you're smoking a joint or something like that.

224
00:17:59.610 --> 00:18:03.910
I know it looks safe like candy, but if you eat it like candy, you will regret it. Okay?

225
00:18:04.560 --> 00:18:09.250
But at least now you can see what they are, and now you know that it exists. That's the whole point.

226
00:18:09.990 --> 00:18:14.890
The next thing on the list is Delta-8 THC vapes. So let me pull up that picture really quick.

227
00:18:14.890 --> 00:18:17.720
As you can see here, a picture of a little vape pen.

228
00:18:18.040 --> 00:18:22.650
And the same way you have the vapes that just have like nicotine and a good flavor, they look the same,

229
00:18:22.650 --> 00:18:26.260
They function the same and everything, except they have Delta-8 THC in them.

230
00:18:26.260 --> 00:18:32.070
So when you're vaping you will get high just like you were smoking Delta-8 THC flower. You see what I'm saying?

231
00:18:33.550 --> 00:18:38.020
Next, what was on the list? Concentrates. Delta-8 THC concentrates,

232
00:18:38.020 --> 00:18:40.390
Which is something like what you see on the screen now.

233
00:18:40.390 --> 00:18:45.090
Now, I've never used concentrates myself or I've never bought them.

234
00:18:45.090 --> 00:18:48.920
I believe I've used them once or twice. And it's something like a wax.

235
00:18:49.580 --> 00:18:51.710
To be honest, I'm not sure if it's the same thing as wax.

236
00:18:51.710 --> 00:18:56.420
But this concentrate that you see here, if I'm not mistaken,

237
00:18:56.420 --> 00:18:58.800
Can be smoked but just using a different apparatus.

238
00:18:58.800 --> 00:19:02.910
But don't quote me on that because I didn't do the research before this episode and I probably should have.

239
00:19:02.910 --> 00:19:05.850
But again, at least you can see it, right?

240
00:19:06.220 --> 00:19:10.380
And like I said before, we're almost to the real point of this episode.

241
00:19:10.570 --> 00:19:13.320
I just wanted to show you this and teach you something new

242
00:19:13.320 --> 00:19:18.200
Because it leads directly into the story I'm going to tell you in just a minute. All right?

243
00:19:18.710 --> 00:19:23.480
So the last thing is Delta-8 THC flower. I don't believe I have a picture of that.

244
00:19:23.480 --> 00:19:27.260
Yes, I do. And as you can see, it looks just like your typical marijuana plant.

245
00:19:27.620 --> 00:19:29.910
Except the chemical compounds are a little bit different.

246
00:19:30.120 --> 00:19:35.010
Now, I've never smoked Delta-8 THC flower, but I have talked to someone who has,

247
00:19:35.010 --> 00:19:38.890
And they said that it's just like, really weak weed. You know?

248
00:19:38.890 --> 00:19:44.220
It's just a lot less potent. And if you smoke weed like, classic Delta-9 THC type of weed,

249
00:19:44.860 --> 00:19:47.870
You're not going to get much enjoyment or pleasure from smoking the Delta-8

250
00:19:47.870 --> 00:19:51.340
Because it's so much weaker than the original that you're used to smoking.

251
00:19:52.050 --> 00:19:57.730
I don't know if that's true, but that's what I was told. All right? I believe that was it.

252
00:19:57.730 --> 00:20:01.090
It talks about the difference between Delta-8 and Delta-9 in the article,

253
00:20:01.090 --> 00:20:06.230
Comparing the effects, where to buy it, and stuff like that. Key takeaways.

254
00:20:06.230 --> 00:20:10.440
So I really don't see a need to read any of that stuff. And I'll just summarize for you right now.

255
00:20:10.440 --> 00:20:13.970
The basic difference between Delta-8 and Delta-9 THC,

256
00:20:14.420 --> 00:20:17.630
From what I understand is how you extract them from the plant

257
00:20:18.280 --> 00:20:22.890
And how strong the effects of each form of THC actually are.

258
00:20:23.470 --> 00:20:29.420
But I will say from personal experience consuming Delta-8 THC. It's a little bit different.

259
00:20:29.420 --> 00:20:34.260
It's not as strong as the original. But like I said, if you consume enough of it, you'll get just as high.

260
00:20:34.480 --> 00:20:38.370
So, you know, just in case, maybe you live in the U.S.

261
00:20:38.370 --> 00:20:40.750
And you're considering trying something like this. Just know that.

262
00:20:40.750 --> 00:20:45.830
Don't think that it's not something to be taken seriously.

263
00:20:45.860 --> 00:20:49.640
Because if you consume too much, things will get serious.

264
00:20:50.720 --> 00:20:54.590
Let me just say it that way and leave it at that. All right?

265
00:20:54.640 --> 00:20:58.470
But the real question now is, why have I told you all this?

266
00:20:59.130 --> 00:21:03.390
Why the hell am I spending all this time, like 20 minutes telling you about Delta-8 THC

267
00:21:03.390 --> 00:21:05.150
And all its products and all these kind of things?

268
00:21:05.870 --> 00:21:09.400
Well, one of the reasons is I think it's just interesting information to know.

269
00:21:09.400 --> 00:21:15.580
Maybe you had no idea that this type of thing exists and that technically weed is now legal in many places in the country.

270
00:21:15.580 --> 00:21:18.630
And we're not talking about the classic type of weed that you roll up and smoke,

271
00:21:19.030 --> 00:21:21.710
Even though they do have that form. But it's a cousin,

272
00:21:21.840 --> 00:21:25.530
A close cousin to the original weed that has more or less the same effects.

273
00:21:25.600 --> 00:21:31.250
And you can buy it just like you go to the store and buy a vape or a beer or anything else, you know?

274
00:21:31.470 --> 00:21:35.060
But the real reason I wanted to tell you that is because it leads directly

275
00:21:35.060 --> 00:21:41.550
Into the story I'm going to tell you now. Okay? Yesterday I got some Delta-8 THC gummies.

276
00:21:41.550 --> 00:21:45.360
These ones right here. If you're watching on YouTube, hopefully, that's in frame.

277
00:21:46.250 --> 00:21:48.920
I'm not promoting these. I'm not getting paid to show you this, obviously.

278
00:21:48.920 --> 00:21:54.240
It's just, I actually bought them. I use them and they work as promised.

279
00:21:54.240 --> 00:21:57.050
I can tell you that, man. I can tell you that for sure.

280
00:21:57.200 --> 00:22:01.180
So I bought the gummies. That's what these are. Little pieces of candy, little gummies.

281
00:22:01.660 --> 00:22:04.370
Actually, I'm going to take them out of the pack just to show you.

282
00:22:04.400 --> 00:22:10.350
I mean, I know you know what gummies look like. But here's one of the gummies from the pack.

283
00:22:11.020 --> 00:22:16.030
And it's 50 milligrams of THC per gummy. Okay?

284
00:22:16.030 --> 00:22:20.890
So in other words, if you're not like a regular weed smoker and you eat two of these,

285
00:22:22.480 --> 00:22:27.950
You will feel the effects. That's for sure. If you eat three, your day is over. Okay?

286
00:22:29.280 --> 00:22:32.830
But anyway, I bought the gummies and I ate more than I should have.

287
00:22:34.090 --> 00:22:39.040
The ones I normally buy were sold out. So the lady recommended these bad boys right here.

288
00:22:39.040 --> 00:22:43.670
And before I left, she said, "Just take one and see how you feel,

289
00:22:43.670 --> 00:22:47.250
Because these ones kick in pretty fast". And when I say "kick in",

290
00:22:47.300 --> 00:22:50.100
I mean come into effect or activate.

291
00:22:50.670 --> 00:22:54.990
It's really common to use this phrasal verb when talking about medicine, pills, or drugs in general.

292
00:22:55.260 --> 00:22:58.800
So I might say, This drug takes about 20 minutes to kick in.

293
00:22:59.160 --> 00:23:02.980
And that's the same thing as saying, This drug takes about 20 minutes to start working

294
00:23:03.290 --> 00:23:06.990
Or it'll be about 20 minutes before you start to feel the effects of the drug.

295
00:23:07.930 --> 00:23:09.550
So anyway, getting back to my story.

296
00:23:10.500 --> 00:23:13.210
The lady basically told me not to take too much too fast

297
00:23:13.210 --> 00:23:16.180
Because the gummies are more potent than the ones I usually buy.

298
00:23:16.540 --> 00:23:19.620
So I'd end up feeling the effects very quickly and very strongly.

299
00:23:20.550 --> 00:23:23.500
But I've been smoking weed and eating weed since I was 15, so I thought,

300
00:23:23.530 --> 00:23:28.540
Shit, I don't need to take it easy. I know my limits. I know what I'm doing, right?

301
00:23:28.540 --> 00:23:32.220
And although that's true, I still ate more than I should have.

302
00:23:33.170 --> 00:23:39.240
She told me to take one and I took three. For the average person, that would be a bad idea.

303
00:23:39.980 --> 00:23:42.740
For someone who isn't used to the feeling of being high off weed

304
00:23:42.740 --> 00:23:45.850
Or someone who has never consumed large amounts of weed before,

305
00:23:46.710 --> 00:23:51.280
Taking three times the recommended amount could end in a pretty unpleasant anxiety attack.

306
00:23:51.640 --> 00:23:52.560
I'm just being honest with you.

307
00:23:53.620 --> 00:23:56.600
Now, when you smoke a lot of weed, all of your senses are heightened

308
00:23:56.600 --> 00:23:59.640
And it can be an intense feeling if you're not prepared for it.

309
00:24:00.420 --> 00:24:03.980
And that intensity can make your heart rate rise. Right?

310
00:24:04.260 --> 00:24:11.430
Which causes you to take shorter breaths and you start to panic because you think something's wrong with you.

311
00:24:12.420 --> 00:24:14.010
And if you're a naturally anxious person,

312
00:24:14.010 --> 00:24:17.360
It's even worse because then your mind starts to race at 100 miles a minute.

313
00:24:17.360 --> 00:24:21.030
Just... Thought after thought, after thought. You panic.

314
00:24:21.840 --> 00:24:23.770
It's a sensation that's hard to describe with words.

315
00:24:23.770 --> 00:24:28.440
And it's also something that not everyone experiences because the plant affects everyone in different ways.

316
00:24:29.390 --> 00:24:32.610
But anyway, I'm much more accustomed to the feeling of being high,

317
00:24:32.610 --> 00:24:35.710
So I usually don't experience too much anxiety when I smoke a lot of weed.

318
00:24:36.450 --> 00:24:40.860
But yesterday I consumed more than I should have and I got pretty fucking high

319
00:24:41.140 --> 00:24:44.160
And I didn't have a panic attack or anything like that.

320
00:24:44.160 --> 00:24:47.670
But I was taking a shower and I found myself being really introspective.

321
00:24:48.730 --> 00:24:52.680
And now that I think about it, every time I smoke weed and take a shower, I get introspective.

322
00:24:53.820 --> 00:24:56.450
I don't know why, but the shower is a great place to think.

323
00:24:57.870 --> 00:25:01.090
Maybe it's the white noise of the water hitting the ground that blocks out everything

324
00:25:01.090 --> 00:25:05.520
So that I'm just left with my thoughts. I don't know.

325
00:25:06.550 --> 00:25:10.400
But I found myself thinking about my life and everything I've done in the last few years

326
00:25:10.400 --> 00:25:16.320
And how it's all a direct result of my choices. We can't control the things that happen to us in life,

327
00:25:16.980 --> 00:25:20.190
But we have complete control over what we make happen in life.

328
00:25:21.450 --> 00:25:27.010
So everything I have and everything I experience today is a direct result of all the choices I've made up to this point.

329
00:25:28.490 --> 00:25:33.680
What does that mean? That means that if I want to have or experience something in the future,

330
00:25:34.120 --> 00:25:38.340
I can make choices that will bring those possessions or experiences into my reality.

331
00:25:39.790 --> 00:25:45.750
I can have, do or be anything I want. I just have to make the right choices.

332
00:25:46.660 --> 00:25:48.610
And that brings me to the point of this episode.

333
00:25:48.610 --> 00:25:53.560
I was in the shower thinking about who I'm becoming and where I'm going in life.

334
00:25:53.560 --> 00:25:58.230
And I had this moment of clarity when I realized I'm really manifesting my dream life

335
00:25:58.290 --> 00:26:01.730
And the best version of myself. And it's all because of the choices I'm making.

336
00:26:03.860 --> 00:26:07.540
One of the most liberating things I've come to realize is that we are free

337
00:26:07.540 --> 00:26:10.040
To do virtually anything we want in this life.

338
00:26:11.550 --> 00:26:16.980
We are the architects of our reality. It doesn't matter how big or small,

339
00:26:17.490 --> 00:26:20.480
How cheap or expensive or how long it's going to take.

340
00:26:21.730 --> 00:26:26.750
If you want something, you can have it. You just have to know exactly what it is.

341
00:26:28.210 --> 00:26:33.580
Strangely, I think that level of freedom isn't exciting or inspiring at all to most people.

342
00:26:34.780 --> 00:26:38.520
I think the realization that you're free to do whatever you want comes with a lot of fear.

343
00:26:39.850 --> 00:26:43.430
Because once someone tells you that you can be, have or do anything you want,

344
00:26:43.430 --> 00:26:49.740
The next logical question is, What exactly do you want? This is where the challenge starts.

345
00:26:51.400 --> 00:26:54.840
A lot of people could very easily tell you what it is they don't want.

346
00:26:55.700 --> 00:26:59.150
But very few people could describe to you in detail what it is they do want.

347
00:27:00.200 --> 00:27:02.840
And even less people could tell you how they're going to get what they want,

348
00:27:03.120 --> 00:27:06.660
Or they're simply delusional about how they're going to get what they want.

349
00:27:07.920 --> 00:27:11.540
And even when somebody decides what they want and how they plan to get it,

350
00:27:11.750 --> 00:27:17.200
They quickly realize that it's much harder than they imagined and it's going to take a lot longer than they imagined.

351
00:27:18.840 --> 00:27:22.660
That's why a lot of people never do what they want. They just do what they're told.

352
00:27:24.270 --> 00:27:25.680
They do what they're told because they're afraid.

353
00:27:27.340 --> 00:27:29.510
Afraid that they'll never figure out exactly what they want.

354
00:27:30.280 --> 00:27:32.650
Afraid they won't be able to figure out how to get what they want.

355
00:27:33.540 --> 00:27:36.060
Afraid they'll waste precious time and money.

356
00:27:36.870 --> 00:27:40.180
Afraid they'll miss out on other opportunities to be happy and successful.

357
00:27:41.410 --> 00:27:45.550
There are a bunch of reasons why people might be afraid of taking their lives into their own hands.

358
00:27:47.010 --> 00:27:49.400
I think the main thing that scares people is responsibility, though.

359
00:27:51.110 --> 00:27:54.250
You cannot separate responsibility from freedom.

360
00:27:55.210 --> 00:28:00.580
And your level of responsibility increases or decreases in direct proportion to the level of freedom you have.

361
00:28:02.220 --> 00:28:05.020
That's why it seems so much easier to just do what you're told.

362
00:28:06.300 --> 00:28:10.200
You can simply outsource the responsibility of deciding what to do with your time and energy.

363
00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:13.340
Because at least that way you know what to expect.

364
00:28:14.750 --> 00:28:20.040
You know that if you arrive at this office at this time and you work for this many hours,

365
00:28:20.210 --> 00:28:24.400
You'll get paid this amount of money. That knowledge makes you feel secure.

366
00:28:26.080 --> 00:28:31.970
Anxiety and insecurity come from a lack of knowledge. Anxiety is just fear of the unknown, right?

367
00:28:33.100 --> 00:28:35.970
So you're just afraid because you don't know exactly what's going to happen

368
00:28:35.970 --> 00:28:40.080
If you choose to walk down the road less traveled. So what do you do?

369
00:28:41.270 --> 00:28:47.050
You trade your freedom for security. You adopt someone else's idea of success.

370
00:28:48.020 --> 00:28:51.620
You work where people tell you to work. You wear what people tell you to wear.

371
00:28:52.340 --> 00:28:56.270
You talk how people want you to talk. You buy what people tell you to buy.

372
00:28:57.830 --> 00:29:00.000
Because this way you feel much more secure.

373
00:29:01.230 --> 00:29:04.220
You're living like everyone else, so you must be doing the right thing.

374
00:29:05.060 --> 00:29:07.900
You have what everyone else has, so you must be doing the right thing.

375
00:29:08.660 --> 00:29:11.670
You look how everyone else looks, so you must be doing the right thing.

376
00:29:13.310 --> 00:29:16.160
But the whole time, your decisions are fueled by fear.

377
00:29:17.880 --> 00:29:21.660
You might say your life is largely determined by circumstances outside of your control.

378
00:29:22.020 --> 00:29:26.670
But no one is forcing you to work where you work or live where you live or eat what you eat.

379
00:29:27.880 --> 00:29:30.320
Those are choices you make every single day.

380
00:29:30.320 --> 00:29:35.430
Now, some people might say it's easy for me to say that as a privileged American

381
00:29:35.430 --> 00:29:39.430
From a country abundant with opportunities and resources. And maybe that's true.

382
00:29:40.570 --> 00:29:44.110
But what's also true is as an adult, you make your own choices.

383
00:29:45.340 --> 00:29:47.570
There are a lot of circumstances outside of your control,

384
00:29:47.570 --> 00:29:51.000
But you will always have control over what you choose to do.

385
00:29:52.530 --> 00:29:57.370
Now, you can say that you don't have enough money or education to live the life you want to live. And maybe that's true.

386
00:29:58.730 --> 00:30:02.650
But how do broke and homeless crackheads manage to get enough money to keep smoking crack?

387
00:30:04.430 --> 00:30:05.630
Have you ever stopped to think about that?

388
00:30:07.480 --> 00:30:12.710
Someone with a lot less than you is still finding a way to get exactly what they want every day.

389
00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:17.310
Now I'm aware that there are many differences between your life and that of a crackhead,

390
00:30:17.340 --> 00:30:23.130
But what I've said remains true. You're virtually free to do whatever you want with your life.

391
00:30:24.740 --> 00:30:28.580
The fear of taking risks and failing will only stop you if you allow it.

392
00:30:29.990 --> 00:30:34.190
And it's important to remember that doing nothing or simply living the life that was handed to you

393
00:30:34.540 --> 00:30:38.300
Is just as big of a risk as trying to realize the life you dream about.

394
00:30:39.720 --> 00:30:42.320
You just have to decide which risk makes more sense for you to take.

395
00:30:44.010 --> 00:30:49.990
So in summary, I've come to the realization that we're virtually free yet very fearful.

396
00:30:52.450 --> 00:30:57.060
Sometimes we're afraid of perceived failure, ridicule, and humiliation.

397
00:30:57.910 --> 00:31:00.840
Other times, we're afraid of how successful we can actually become.

398
00:31:01.960 --> 00:31:05.670
Because if you've spent your whole life believing that you're not capable of achieving success,

399
00:31:06.330 --> 00:31:08.450
Then the idea of making that achievement can be scary.

400
00:31:10.270 --> 00:31:13.470
Some people are afraid of giving everything they ever wanted

401
00:31:13.470 --> 00:31:16.200
Because they know that they could lose it at any moment.

402
00:31:17.100 --> 00:31:21.730
So instead of ever having to experience that pain, they just avoid the pleasure altogether.

403
00:31:23.820 --> 00:31:29.820
So many of our decisions are fueled by fear. So much of our life is spent playing defense.

404
00:31:31.520 --> 00:31:33.600
But I want to encourage you to start playing offense.

405
00:31:34.370 --> 00:31:36.630
I encourage you to take a look at your life and ask yourself,

406
00:31:37.340 --> 00:31:40.070
Where am I going? How am I going to get there?

407
00:31:40.910 --> 00:31:43.300
What am I willing to do in order to get there?

408
00:31:43.300 --> 00:31:49.780
And these questions can involve everything from your money and career to your family and personal relationships.

409
00:31:50.110 --> 00:31:54.660
In fact, these questions involve every aspect of your life. You get to decide.

410
00:31:56.260 --> 00:31:59.640
You decide what kind of people you want in your life, what type of work you want to do,

411
00:31:59.860 --> 00:32:05.900
Where you want to live, how you spend your time. You decide all of that every single day.

412
00:32:08.460 --> 00:32:12.240
Being the best version of your true self comes with responsibility.

413
00:32:13.880 --> 00:32:17.710
Living life on your terms comes with responsibility.

414
00:32:19.360 --> 00:32:23.100
Now maybe you don't like the way that sounds. But in my experience,

415
00:32:23.840 --> 00:32:28.950
A life full of responsibilities is much better than a life full of obligations.

416
00:32:30.500 --> 00:32:36.620
Think about it.

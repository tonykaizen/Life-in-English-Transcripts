00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:03.320
In this episode, I'm going to teach you a useful English expression

2
00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:05.080
to help you sound more natural.

3
00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:10.980
Good morning, my friend!

4
00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:13.650
This is Coffee with Kaizen number 19.

5
00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:16.810
And in this episode, like I said, I'm going to teach you a simple,

6
00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:20.630
Useful English expression to help you sound a little more natural in

7
00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:21.920
your daily conversations.

8
00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:26.160
And that expression is to be able to use something.

9
00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:29.810
All right? Now, we use this expression to say that something would

10
00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:33.300
be nice or that something would be useful,

11
00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:38.280
Or that we would like something, or that we need something.

12
00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.270
So hopefully that's not too confusing.

13
00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:42.800
But like always, I'm going to give you some examples and you'll see

14
00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:46.660
that those. Four things are more or less the same thing when we're

15
00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:47.940
using this expression. All right?

16
00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:49.780
So let's not waste any time.

17
00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:51.190
Let's get into these examples.

18
00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:57.370
Number one, I could use some help with my homework if you're not too

19
00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:00.390
busy. So let's imagine you're talking to your brother, your mom,

20
00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:03.030
Somebody, somebody that can help you and you say,

21
00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:06.560
"I could use some homework with my..." I could use some homework?

22
00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:11.010
Don't say that.

23
00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:16.100
Let's do that again. Example number one, I could use some help with

24
00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:17.940
my homework if you're not too busy.

25
00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:22.710
So what you're saying is basically, it would be nice if you helped me

26
00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:24.550
with my homework or

27
00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:28.060
I would like it if you helped me with my homework.

28
00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:30.230
Right? I need some help with my homework.

29
00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:33.030
So hopefully you can see I'm really just saying the same thing in a

30
00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:34.990
different way. It would be nice if you helped me.

31
00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:36.610
I would like it if you helped me.

32
00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:38.140
I need some help. Right?

33
00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:39.810
I could use some help.

34
00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:42.520
That's the idea. Here's another example.

35
00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:46.120
Man, you look like you could use a drink.

36
00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:49.930
You look like you could use a drink.

37
00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:53.550
So let's imagine you're talking to your friend and he's had a long

38
00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:57.310
day at work. He's been super stressed dealing with frustration and

39
00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:01.160
deadlines And assignments and his boss and just all of this

40
00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:04.280
nonsense. He's just really, really tired and frustrated.

41
00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:07.670
Y ou look at him and you're like, "Man, you look like you would

42
00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:09.440
appreciate a nice drink".

43
00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:15.170
You look like you need a drink or you look like you could use a

44
00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:16.280
drink. All right?

45
00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:21.150
Another example. This place could use a renovation.

46
00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:24.410
So let's imagine you go to a house or you're going to buy a house or

47
00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:26.130
something like that, but it's really old.

48
00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:29.860
It hasn't been painted or hasn't been renovated actually.

49
00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:31.690
It hasn't been renovated in a long time.

50
00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:33.110
It's just old and outdated.

51
00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:35.680
It needs to be renovated, updated.

52
00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:39.160
It needs new fixtures and doors and paint and things like that.

53
00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:42.700
You can say, "this place could use a renovation".

54
00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:45.680
Which is the same thing as saying, "this place needs to be

55
00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:50.190
renovated". Or it would be nice if someone renovated this place.

56
00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:52.840
This place could use a renovation.

57
00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:54.730
All right? Here's another example.

58
00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:57.790
We can use all the help we can get.

59
00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:00.740
Man, we can use all the help we can get.

60
00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:02.140
Which is the same thing as saying,

61
00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:05.190
"we need all the help that is available to us".

62
00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:10.280
Right? Or any help big or small would be useful to us.

63
00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:12.850
So we can use all the help that we can get,

64
00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:15.570
All the help that we can possibly receive, we can use it.

65
00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:17.440
We need it. It would be nice.

66
00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:19.540
We would appreciate it. You see what I'm saying?

67
00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:23.010
Now, if you want to put emphasis on this phrase,

68
00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:28.520
We can put the word 'really' in between the words 'could' and 'use'.

69
00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:31.700
For example, I could really use a drink right now.

70
00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:36.680
I could really use a drink right now, which basically means I

71
00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:38.720
seriously need a drink.

72
00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:40.320
I would really appreciate it.

73
00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:41.480
I could really use it.

74
00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:43.320
You know? Another example.

75
00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.230
We could really use some help on this project.

76
00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:49.200
We're stressed, man. We don't have enough people working on this

77
00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:52.020
project. We could really use some help.

78
00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:53.760
We would really appreciate it.

79
00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:55.020
It would be great.

80
00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:56.720
We seriously need some help.

81
00:03:57.070 --> 00:04:01.300
Okay? One more example, I could really use a vacation.

82
00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:05.300
I've been working for the last two years on this project nonstop.

83
00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:06.840
No breaks, no vacation.

84
00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:08.510
No nothing. I work 10 hours a day.

85
00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:12.120
I'm tired. I could really use a vacation.

86
00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:14.190
A vacation would be really nice.

87
00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:16.770
I seriously need a vacation.

88
00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:20.100
Now, I said this phrase would help you sound more natural,

89
00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:23.300
But the truth is that you don't need to use this phrase to sound

90
00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:26.910
natural. This is just another way of saying something would be nice

91
00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:28.920
or something would be useful,

92
00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:32.470
Or we would like something or we need something.

93
00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:35.120
It's just another way of saying those four things, which in this

94
00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:38.200
context, they're all essentially the same thing.

95
00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:40.750
Right? All of those phrases are completely fine.

96
00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:43.030
You know? Like, a drink would be nice.

97
00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:44.670
A drink would be useful.

98
00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:47.480
I would like a drink or I need a drink.

99
00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:50.110
Right? All of those are fine. I'm just teaching you another way of

100
00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:52.270
saying the same thing because it's also...

101
00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:55.810
Or excuse me, it's always nice to be able to switch things up from

102
00:04:55.810 --> 00:04:59.680
time to time. So in other words, it's always nice to be able to do

103
00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:02.190
or say the same thing in a different way.

104
00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:06.030
So instead of always saying I need this or I need that,

105
00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:10.120
You can say I could use this or I could use that.

106
00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:13.670
All right? So if you have any doubts, feel free to send me a

107
00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:15.810
message, man. But hopefully, the explanation was clear.

108
00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:17.540
And that's it for now, man.

109
00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:20.300
That's Coffee with Kaizen number 19 in the books.

110
00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:22.620
So I will talk to you tomorrow.

111
00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:23.830
Peace!

00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:09.140
Here are six English words that are stronger than "bad".
What's up, my friend?

2
00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:15.090
This is Coffee with Kaizen number #7. Hope you're doing all
right this morning. And this episode, like I said in the

3
00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:20.770
intro, I'm gonna be teaching you six English words that are
stronger than the word "bad". Now, you know what I always

4
00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:30.240
say? We're not going to waste any time. Let's get right into
this episode. So word number one: awful. "Awful".

5
00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:33.960
A-W-F-U-L. "Awful".

6
00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:42.490
Now, the definition of "awful" is "very bad or unpleasant".
Another definition is "extremely shocking or horrific". So

7
00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:49.810
let me give you an example. "This food tastes awful." "This
food tastes awful", right?

8
00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:56.360
"This food tastes very, very bad. It's very unpleasant.
There's absolutely no pleasure when I'm eating this food."

9
00:00:56.700 --> 00:01:04.450
Another example, "Her apartment smells awful." "Man, her
apartment smells awful." So the context I want you to

10
00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:11.200
understand or the idea I want you to get about this word is
a lot of times, we'll use it to describe food or drinks or

11
00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:17.090
smells or things like that. Anything that when you
experience it, just naturally you and your body go, "ugh",

12
00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:18.560
like, "Ugh!

13
00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:25.350
That's awful! Ugh god, it's awful!" Now, there are other
times when somebody would say, like, "You're an awful

14
00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:30.380
person", or something like that, because again, it just
means "very bad". That's the true meaning of this word. But

15
00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:36.960
a lot of times we use it with smells and food and drinks and
feelings and things of that nature. Anything that makes you

16
00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:44.630
go, "Ugh! Just fucking awful." You see what I'm saying? 
Alright, word number two on the list is "mediocre".

17
00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:51.860
"Mediocre". M-E-D-I-O-C-R-E. "Mediocre".

18
00:01:52.270 --> 00:02:00.010
Now the definition of "mediocre" is "of only moderate
quality"; "not very good". Okay so again, the opposite of

19
00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:07.340
"good" is just "bad". Just a stronger word or more specific
word, let's say, so here's an example, "He did a really

20
00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:14.720
mediocre job." Like, "Man, he did a really mediocre job." 
What...maybe somebody who built your house or working on

21
00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:20.370
your car or whatever it is. Somebody who was doing a job,
did a "mediocre" job. They didn't do a good job, didn't do a

22
00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:27.040
satisfactory job. It was "mediocre". It was below average.
It was bad. You see what I'm saying? Low quality. So another

23
00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:34.990
example, you could say, "I don't like Microsoft. They make
mediocre products." "Yeah, I don't like that company because

24
00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:40.580
they make mediocre products. They don't make good products;
they're cheap; they're of low quality; they're not very

25
00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:47.780
good." So in this case the word "mediocre", a lot of times
we'll use it with things like performance or products or

26
00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:53.270
things like that, when we're talking about the quality of
something, or the level of quality. You see what I'm saying?

27
00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:59.240
"That's a mediocre product, that's mediocre performance.
It's not good enough." You see what I'm saying? It's just...

28
00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:07.980
it's bad. That's the idea. Hmmm...alright word number three:
"terrible".

29
00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:13.730
"Terrible". T-E-R-R-I-B-L-E.

30
00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:21.690
"Terrible". The definition of "terrible" is "extremely or
distressingly bad or serious." Another definition is

31
00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:30.190
"extremely incompetent or unskillful." So let me give you an
example of the first definition: "That movie was terrible."

32
00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:37.660
"That movie was terrible. I mean, like, extremely bad." Now,
that's not necessarily a serious situation just because the

33
00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:44.600
movie was bad. Don't have to take that too seriously. But
the idea is that it's just extremely bad. Extremely bad.

34
00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:51.490
Similar to "awful" - also has the idea of extremely bad,
right? Now an example of "extremely incompetent or

35
00:03:51.610 --> 00:04:00.400
unskillful", I could say, "He is a terrible manager." "He's
a terrible manager. He's an incompetent manager. He's not a

36
00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:07.820
skilled manager. He is not good at what he does. In fact, he
is extremely bad at what he does. He is terrible." Okay?

37
00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:14.710
Next word on the list. Number four...number four:
"disappointing".

38
00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:22.360
"Disappointing". Now, one little pronunciation detail here
is...first let me spell it for you, then I'll explain.

39
00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:26.460
"Disappointing". D-I-S-A-P-P-O-I-N-T-I-N-G.

40
00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:32.170
That's a long word.

41
00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:39.750
"Disappointing". Okay so you see, there is a "T" in that
word: "disappoint-ing". But a lot of Americans, in my

42
00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:46.340
experience, we don't really pronounce the "T" like a hard
"T". It almost becomes an "N" or just disappears completely.

43
00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:53.830
So instead of saying, "That is disappointing", I would say,
"That's disappointing." "Disappointing". So there's no "T"

44
00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:59.860
in that word when I say it. It's there, you know, but I kind
of just ignore it. It's like the black sheep or whatever of

45
00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:05.680
the word. It's not there. So just...I brought that to your
attention because it happens all the time with so many

46
00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:11.530
different words and I'll try to bring that to your attention
more in future episodes but let's get back to the word:

47
00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:18.160
"disappointing". The definition of "disappointing" is
"failing to fulfill someone's hopes or expectations". The

48
00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:23.900
example about the movie, right? "That was a terrible movie." 
Maybe the ending is what made it terrible for you because

49
00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:30.550
the ending was so "disappointing". You wasted two hours of
your life for this really bad ending, this poor ending, and

50
00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:37.910
it disappointed you because you were hoping that it was
gonna be good. And at the end, it was bad. Alright? Another

51
00:05:37.910 --> 00:05:45.020
example, "They've made a disappointing start to the season."
So let's imagine you're a soccer fan, basketball fan,

52
00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:54.240
whatever it is. New season 2021, you're all excited and your
team loses the first nine games. Obviously not good; that's

53
00:05:54.240 --> 00:06:00.970
very, very bad. It's "disappointing" because you, as a fan,
have these high hopes, right? Your aspirations, your hopes,

54
00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:07.770
your expectations of your team are very high, very positive,
and they lose nine games in a row to start the season.

55
00:06:07.770 --> 00:06:16.430
That's a "disappointing start", okay? I'm sure that makes
sense. So, word number five: "shitty". "Shitty".

56
00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:25.410
S-H-I-T-T-Y. Now, just so you know, this is a rude word and
it's kind of considered like vulgar slang. It's not

57
00:06:25.410 --> 00:06:31.090
something that you would use everyday or with anyone, just
so you know, "shitty". So the definition of the word

58
00:06:31.090 --> 00:06:38.780
"shitty": when you're talking about "a person or an action
is contemptible or worthless." That second word is a better

59
00:06:38.780 --> 00:06:45.000
definition. It just means worthless, not valuable at all
because it's so bad. Now, if you're talking about an

60
00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:51.460
experience or a situation, it just means very, very
unpleasant or awful. So let me give you some examples.

61
00:06:51.960 --> 00:07:00.280
Number one, "Her music is really shitty." "Ah, yeah, her
music is really shitty." "Why don't you like that artist?"

62
00:07:00.500 --> 00:07:06.260
"Because the music is shitty, bro. It's trash. I don't like
it. It's really, really bad." You see what I'm saying? Now

63
00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:13.070
we're talking about an experience, for example. "That's a
shitty way to treat somebody." "That's a shitty way to treat

64
00:07:13.070 --> 00:07:21.040
somebody, man. That's a very, very unpleasant, awful, poor,
negative, bad way to treat somebody." So in the first

65
00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:27.830
example, we're talking about the quality. Her music has no
value; it's worthless; it's shitty, right? In the second

66
00:07:27.830 --> 00:07:33.940
example, we're talking more about an experience or a
situation: "That's a shitty way to treat somebody", a very

67
00:07:34.040 --> 00:07:40.910
unpleasant and awful way to be treating another person. So
just in case you haven't really noticed it, the word

68
00:07:40.910 --> 00:07:48.160
"shitty" comes from the word "shit", S-H-I-T, which has
multiple meanings but just understand that in this case,

69
00:07:48.770 --> 00:07:54.800
it's something bad; it's trash; it's terrible; it's all
negative. The word "shit" in almost every case is not

70
00:07:54.800 --> 00:08:01.330
positive, okay? So the word "shit" comes from "shitty" and
that's why we can use it in that way, alright? So last word

71
00:08:01.330 --> 00:08:04.090
on the list number six: "wack".

72
00:08:05.340 --> 00:08:07.870
W-A-C-K. "Wack".

73
00:08:08.350 --> 00:08:14.810
Alright? Now, this is also considered slang, like if you use
this in certain cases, people might not understand you. It

74
00:08:14.810 --> 00:08:20.320
just depends on where you are and who you're talking to. I'm
almost positive that everyone understands the word "shitty",

75
00:08:20.740 --> 00:08:27.990
but "wack" I can't say with certainty that everyone's gonna
understand this word, but the meaning is just "bad or

76
00:08:27.990 --> 00:08:36.070
inferior". That's the definition of "wack". So for example,
"That song is wack as hell." "Man, that song is wack as

77
00:08:36.070 --> 00:08:42.140
hell, bro. I'm not listening to that shit. That song is
shitty. It's wack as hell", which means it's really, really,

78
00:08:42.140 --> 00:08:51.010
really bad. And just to explain really quickly, the phrase
"as hell" in that sentence, "That song is wack as hell", "as

79
00:08:51.010 --> 00:08:58.170
hell" is just a way to put emphasis on an adjective in
English. *clears throat* so if I say, "That song is wack as

80
00:08:58.170 --> 00:09:05.710
hell", that song is "wack", but is super "wack", it's
extremely "wack". So another example is ah..."Man, that guy

81
00:09:05.710 --> 00:09:12.950
is funny as hell", or "That movie was exciting as hell."
These aren't the best examples, but when I use the words "as

82
00:09:12.950 --> 00:09:19.380
hell" right after an adjective, it's a way of putting
emphasis on that adjective. Hopefully that makes sense and

83
00:09:19.380 --> 00:09:24.630
understand that the word "hell", in most people's minds it's
a curse word, so just be careful when you use that because

84
00:09:24.930 --> 00:09:30.640
you might not want to use that at work, with your boss or,
you know, somebody's grandparents or something like that.

85
00:09:30.770 --> 00:09:36.850
Just so you know, it is considered like a bad word. Alright? 
But, back to the word "wack", here's another example:

86
00:09:37.720 --> 00:09:44.850
"Rappers these days are so wack." "Man, these rappers out
here these days. These new rappers are so wack, bro, they're

87
00:09:44.920 --> 00:09:51.800
trash. They're very, very bad. They're inferior to the...to
the rappers of the past." That's the idea. "They suck!"

88
00:09:52.240 --> 00:09:58.850
That's another way of saying it, alright? Example number
three, "That shirt you got on is wack, bro." "Man, where did

89
00:09:58.850 --> 00:10:05.110
you get that shirt, bro? That shit is wack." You know what
I'm saying? "That shirt is ugly, low quality. Take it off.

90
00:10:05.110 --> 00:10:10.530
It's bad. I don't like it. It's not cool." And that's really
the idea that you can have with the word "wack". It's just

91
00:10:10.530 --> 00:10:16.880
the opposite of "cool". "Cool" is something good, stylish,
"Yeah, I look good. I'm cool." "Wack" is the exact opposite.

92
00:10:17.360 --> 00:10:23.670
If it's not "cool", that shit is "wack". Alright, my friend,
now you got six English words that are stronger than the

93
00:10:23.670 --> 00:10:29.380
word "bad". Hopefully you understand the context in which we
use all six of these words but as always, if you've got any

94
00:10:29.380 --> 00:10:34.810
questions or doubts, leave them in the comment section on
YouTube or shoot me a message on social media. Do whatever

95
00:10:34.810 --> 00:10:41.120
you got to do to get in contact with me and I'll see if I
can help you out. But that is Coffee with Kaizen #7 in the

96
00:10:41.120 --> 00:10:44.040
books. See you tomorrow. Peace!

00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:05.680
"What options do I have for learning English as a foreign
language?" Surprisingly, this is a question that many

2
00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:12.080
English learners never ask themselves. I met a lot of people
who never actually did any research before they enrolled in

3
00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:18.590
a course, downloaded an app, or signed up for a class. Now,
personally, I'd like to know which options are available to

4
00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:23.830
me and the pros and cons of each one before I make a choice,
because I don't want to waste my time going down the wrong

5
00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:29.740
path. You feel me? So in this episode, I'm going to lay out
all the options you've got for learning English as a foreign

6
00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:35.280
language so you can pick the best option for you, stop
making excuses, and start making progress.

7
00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:50.460
Alright, my friend! Let's get started with the first option,
which is the traditional language school. Traditional

8
00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:55.500
language schools are probably still the most popular choice
for people who want to learn English. Personally, I don't

9
00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:00.050
think this is because language schools are the most
effective. It's just because most people think that's the

10
00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:07.020
only logical choice they have. They think, "When I want to
learn a new subject, I need to go to a school and take a

11
00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:10.270
class." The environment feels familiar.

12
00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:16.190
When you're in a classroom, you know that you're there to be
instructed, tested, and then certified in a particular

13
00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:22.580
subject or discipline. That's how we did it in school.
That's how I was done at university. So that must be the

14
00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:30.480
correct way to learn. Now, the problem with the methodology
of traditional schools is that it's all theory and no

15
00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:33.190
practice. So what is "theory"?

16
00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:44.250
A set of principles on which the practice of an activity is
based. What is "practice"? The actual application or

17
00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:50.350
use of an idea, belief, or method as opposed to theories
relating to it.

18
00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:57.360
So what I'm trying to say is, schools typically teach you to
obsess over the technical aspects of the language, like

19
00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:04.960
phrasal verbs, prepositions, and the second conditional. The
way we form sentences and choose our words is based on

20
00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:12.050
underlying principles like these. And the problem I see with
this methodology is it almost never encourages the students

21
00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:20.690
to put these theories into practice. Instead, it encourages
them to memorize information and pass a test. But passing a

22
00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:29.120
written exam isn't proof that you know how to do something.
It just means you know how something is done. For example,

23
00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:35.020
let's imagine you wanted to learn how to play soccer. So you
show up at the academy ready to learn. But before you can

24
00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:41.570
play, the instructor says, you're going to need to sign a
three-year contract, pay a hefty enrollment fee, buy some

25
00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:47.600
books you're never going to use, follow a learning path that
wasn't made for you specifically, and sit in a classroom

26
00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:55.990
reading about the rules of the game of soccer and then being
tested on your knowledge of those rules. Imagine doing that

27
00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:58.690
every week for three years.

28
00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:06.490
Never once kicking a ball, never once training your
footwork, never once working on your endurance; just reading

29
00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:13.990
and writing about the game, hoping to wake up one day with
this magical ability to play the game like Messi. That's

30
00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:21.380
what a typical English learner experiences every day of the
week at these language schools. Now, I said that I was going

31
00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:26.770
to tell you the pros and cons of each option, but I really
cannot think of any benefits of going to a traditional

32
00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:34.730
school. You waste time going to and from the physical
location, you pay for materials you do not need, you don't

33
00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:40.690
practice the skill you're paying good money to learn, you
have almost zero support from the school outside of class,

34
00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:48.150
and the classes aren't even personalized for anyone in
particular. In my humble opinion, there are more practical

35
00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:57.040
and effective ways to learn a language. And that brings us
to your next option for learning a language, and that option

36
00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:04.480
is private classes. Private online classes have become very
popular over the last few years. More and more people are

37
00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:10.790
realizing that the Internet has eliminated the need for
going to a physical location to learn certain skills. So

38
00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:16.090
online classes are great because you get to work one on one
with someone who will give you their undivided attention and

39
00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:22.410
teach you only what you need to know. And the fact that
you're the only student in the class means that the class

40
00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:28.910
can be prepared to meet your specific needs as opposed to
the general needs of students at your level. You also get to

41
00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:35.590
express yourself in a more intimate and less intimidating
environment. And many of us are introverted and don't like

42
00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:42.300
speaking up in group discussions, and others are just afraid
of sounding silly in front of other people. Regardless of

43
00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:47.920
what the reason may be, many people love the idea of private
classes because you get that special attention from a

44
00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:55.490
dedicated teacher and you're free to express yourself
without worrying about how you sound. Spoken English is

45
00:04:55.490 --> 00:05:01.470
learned through conversation, and the best private English
classes are the ones that get you out of the classroom and

46
00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:08.340
into a conversation with a real person. And the problem that
some English learners have with private English classes is

47
00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:15.470
the price. It just so happens that countries like the US and
England have relatively strong currencies and I'm not sure

48
00:05:15.470 --> 00:05:21.080
about our neighbors to the north or the folks down under,
but I imagine they're on par with us as well. So when you

49
00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:25.960
want to take classes with a teacher from these countries,
you might find that the currency exchange rates can really

50
00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:34.980
limit your options. The private English classes are an
investment. And what is an "investment"? Google's dictionary

51
00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:42.360
defines the word "investment" as an act of devoting time,
effort, or energy to a particular undertaking with the

52
00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:50.660
expectation of a worthwhile result. Now, another way of
saying the same thing is putting in the work now, knowing

53
00:05:50.660 --> 00:05:57.820
that if you see a reward, it won't be until much later. And
the challenge with this investment is that you don't just

54
00:05:57.820 --> 00:06:04.120
need to invest effort and energy, even though those are the
most important factors. You also have to invest a sizable

55
00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:08.690
amount of money because it's not like you can just take
classes for three months and become proficient in this

56
00:06:08.690 --> 00:06:15.100
language. So for some people, the amount of money they would
have to invest in this option makes it inaccessible to them.

57
00:06:16.450 --> 00:06:22.090
But fear not, my friends! Thanks to the Internet, lots of
dedicated software developers and some ambitious

58
00:06:22.150 --> 00:06:30.390
entrepreneurs, there are now plenty of other options for
learning any widely spoken language on the Internet. And

59
00:06:30.390 --> 00:06:37.780
that brings us to our next option: an online learning
community. Learning English in an online community is a

60
00:06:37.780 --> 00:06:44.470
relatively new idea for most people. Thanks to apps like
Discord, it's easier than ever for people to connect via

61
00:06:44.470 --> 00:06:50.660
text, voice, and video from anywhere in the world. So
instead of sitting in a classroom and following a teacher's

62
00:06:50.660 --> 00:06:56.370
instruction, you can just get on the Discord Server and
speak with your teacher and other learners. It's like a new

63
00:06:56.370 --> 00:07:03.060
and improved version of group classes. Your teacher will
host group discussions two or three times a week so everyone

64
00:07:03.060 --> 00:07:07.670
can practice and get their mistakes corrected in real time.
And when you're not involved in a discussion with your

65
00:07:07.670 --> 00:07:13.630
teacher, you're free to practice and learn with other
students. And the idea of learning and growing with other

66
00:07:13.670 --> 00:07:21.150
English learners sounds counterintuitive to people who spent
their entire lives being instructed by a teacher. They say

67
00:07:21.150 --> 00:07:26.950
things like, "If you want to learn real English, you've got
to move to the country and speak with the natives every day.

68
00:07:28.200 --> 00:07:35.310
If you want to learn real English, you've got to take
classes or buy a course made by a native teacher. Non-native

69
00:07:35.310 --> 00:07:42.110
speakers don't know when I'm saying something incorrect so I
can't improve with them." And although these opinions are

70
00:07:42.110 --> 00:07:49.060
valid, I'd have to say I disagree with them. Now, of course,
learning from natives is the most natural and effective way.

71
00:07:49.650 --> 00:07:55.340
But everyone is a teacher because everyone knows something
you don't. And not only that, but Discord is not just an

72
00:07:55.340 --> 00:08:01.330
online chat room for communities. It also acts as an online
forum. And that means even when you're practicing with other

73
00:08:01.330 --> 00:08:06.790
students and your teacher isn't present, you can simply
create a post explaining your doubts, asking your questions,

74
00:08:06.790 --> 00:08:11.570
and your teacher will answer your question at their earliest
convenience. Or even better, another member of your

75
00:08:11.570 --> 00:08:18.520
community might have the answer you're looking for. Learning
a language is a real challenge, but when you do it with the

76
00:08:18.520 --> 00:08:25.180
community, you can learn from the experiences of people who
have been in the same position as you. You can hold each

77
00:08:25.180 --> 00:08:31.340
other accountable, keep each other motivated, and share your
progress with each other. Now the cool thing about

78
00:08:31.340 --> 00:08:37.100
communities is that they also tend to be very diverse. So
when you interact with people from all walks of life, you

79
00:08:37.100 --> 00:08:44.790
learn more than just language. You share culture,
philosophy, ideas, and information. English becomes less of

80
00:08:44.790 --> 00:08:52.680
a goal to be reached and more of a tool to be used for
connecting with other people. The entire world is learning

81
00:08:53.060 --> 00:08:58.290
and speaking English. So having the experience of
communicating with a diverse crowd is a huge advantage in

82
00:08:58.290 --> 00:09:05.190
today's global economy. However, some people struggle with
the idea of learning in an online community because it

83
00:09:05.190 --> 00:09:12.340
requires you to take responsibility for your education.
There is no school or teacher creating a study routine for

84
00:09:12.340 --> 00:09:19.700
you. No one is reminding you to practice this skill daily.
You have to take it upon yourself to show up every day and

85
00:09:19.720 --> 00:09:25.560
interact with your community. You constantly have to be
consuming useful content in English, taking notes on things

86
00:09:25.560 --> 00:09:31.040
you don't understand, asking other community members for
clarification, starting conversations about interesting

87
00:09:31.040 --> 00:09:38.180
topics, and trying to improve your communication skills. 
Unfortunately, there are a lot of English learners who

88
00:09:38.180 --> 00:09:44.580
hesitate when considering this option because they prefer a
fixed path to follow: a teacher to hold them accountable, a

89
00:09:44.580 --> 00:09:52.270
guaranteed result at the end of a predetermined process. But
I can tell you now, online communities are the future of

90
00:09:52.270 --> 00:09:58.790
practical and effective language education for intermediate
and advanced learners. I mean, you can access them from

91
00:09:58.870 --> 00:10:04.770
anywhere in the world. They're much more affordable than
traditional schools and online classes. You get to connect

92
00:10:04.770 --> 00:10:11.150
with natives and non-natives alike, making for a richer
learning experience. You can stay online and interact with

93
00:10:11.150 --> 00:10:17.700
people everyday for as long as you want. And you get to
learn in the most natural way, which is just talking about

94
00:10:17.700 --> 00:10:24.500
life with your friends. So for those who are truly motivated
to learn, interested in connecting with like-minded

95
00:10:24.530 --> 00:10:31.520
individuals and consistent in their practice, an online
community is the most practical way to go from lower

96
00:10:31.520 --> 00:10:38.630
intermediate to advanced speaker in a natural and
cost-effective way. But maybe this option doesn't tickle

97
00:10:38.630 --> 00:10:47.620
your fancy. So let's talk about a couple more. The next
option on the list is online courses. Online courses are a

98
00:10:47.620 --> 00:10:54.200
good tool for learning about the fundamental concepts of a
specific subject. They're great for giving you practical yet

99
00:10:54.270 --> 00:11:01.100
detailed examples of how something works. Some courses might
even encourage you to accomplish tasks on your own using the

100
00:11:01.100 --> 00:11:08.090
knowledge you've gained from the course. It's the ultimate
tool for learning specific skills at your own pace. For

101
00:11:08.090 --> 00:11:15.860
example, communicating effectively in English is a skill.
However, there are a number of particular skills that fall

102
00:11:15.900 --> 00:11:23.960
under the umbrella of this more general skill. Like making
small talk. Some people can talk about technical things very

103
00:11:23.960 --> 00:11:29.600
well, but they don't know how to start and maintain casual
conversations with strangers. So if you already know how to

104
00:11:29.600 --> 00:11:36.870
speak English but want to get better at making small talk,
you might take a course on making effective small talk. This

105
00:11:36.870 --> 00:11:42.770
course wouldn't focus on things like phrasal verbs and
prepositions or advanced technical vocabulary. It would

106
00:11:42.770 --> 00:11:49.560
teach you more about the art of communication and the things
that compel us to listen and speak to other people. That's a

107
00:11:49.560 --> 00:11:54.470
specific skill that could be taught effectively through a
course. And obviously it would be better if you had some,

108
00:11:54.840 --> 00:12:00.130
you know, live practice with an instructor. But the point is
that the course could teach you the fundamental concepts so

109
00:12:00.130 --> 00:12:06.200
that you could then go practice in the real world. I tend to
see people hesitate when considering this option because

110
00:12:06.500 --> 00:12:12.310
there are a lot of snake oil salesman out there who promise
things they don't actually deliver. There are lots of

111
00:12:12.310 --> 00:12:18.410
courses that are only designed to take your money and not
teach you anything useful. So a lot of English learners

112
00:12:18.410 --> 00:12:25.040
hesitate out of fear of wasting their time and hard earned
money. They also know that an online course can be extremely

113
00:12:25.040 --> 00:12:32.950
helpful, but in the end it could never replace real human
interaction. The only courses that are truly useful for

114
00:12:32.950 --> 00:12:38.730
intermediate and advanced learners are the ones that help
them improve specific, more advanced skills, like the art of

115
00:12:38.730 --> 00:12:46.040
communication, as I mentioned earlier, or how to use
podcasts to improve your English. Alright, my friend, there

116
00:12:46.040 --> 00:12:51.400
you have it. Now you know about all the options you have for
learning English as a foreign language. So the only thing

117
00:12:51.400 --> 00:12:57.800
left to do is decide which one is best for you and get
started as soon as possible. And the next time you hear

118
00:12:57.800 --> 00:13:03.450
someone asking how they should learn English, kindly send
them this episode and tell them to listen until the end.

119
00:13:03.450 --> 00:13:11.750
Because the most important thing that all of you need to
hear is this: no matter which method, app, school,

120
00:13:11.750 --> 00:13:18.500
community, or teacher you choose, there's one thing that
will never change. If you want to be proficient in English,

121
00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:25.510
you've got to read texts in English everyday. You've got to
listen to people speak about a wide variety of subjects in

122
00:13:25.510 --> 00:13:33.470
English everyday. You've got to write text messages, emails,
and journal entries in English everyday. And most

123
00:13:33.470 --> 00:13:40.730
importantly, you've got to speak English with yourself or
another human being every single day.

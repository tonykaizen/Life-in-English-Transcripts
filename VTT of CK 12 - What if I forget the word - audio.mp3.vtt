00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:09.270
What should you do if you can't remember a word in the
middle of a conversation? Good

2
00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:18.170
morning, my friend. This is Coffee with Kaizen #12. Today is
Friday, August 27, 2021. Although for you it's most likely

3
00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:24.170
Monday so I hope you had a good weekend. Very happy to be
here with you this morning, giving you some tips and

4
00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:30.380
knowledge. I don't have any notes or particular lessons for
you this morning, but I was just thinking about something

5
00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:35.730
that we all go through as language learners and a solution
to that problem that has worked for me and many of my

6
00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:41.240
students and friends as well, so I just want to share it
with you really quick, so I'm hoping that this episode is

7
00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:46.140
going to be short because typically, when I don't write
notes or anything, my episodes get very long because I just

8
00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:52.200
talk and talk and talk and talk, you know, because I'm a
podcaster. But anyway, the tip I wanted to share with you

9
00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:56.360
today is about something that we all experience.

10
00:00:56.360 --> 00:01:02.110
Like I said, as language learners, even in our native
language, sometimes it happens to us. And what I'm talking

11
00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:08.340
about is when you're having a conversation with somebody and
for whatever reason, just out of nowhere or unexpectedly,

12
00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:16.010
you can't remember the word or the expression or the phrase
that you would like to use in that moment. See what I'm

13
00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:21.410
saying? So we could be talking and you're describing this
idea or something that happened to you or what you think

14
00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:28.530
about a particular situation and you just can't remember the
word that perfectly expresses whatever it is you're trying

15
00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:34.190
to say. And what happens is a lot of times when we're
learning a foreign language, we already kind of feel

16
00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:40.260
insecure about our level, our abilities, pronunciation,
whatever it is. We're already kind of nervous to be

17
00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:47.310
communicating in this foreign language and on top of that,
we get even more nervous when we start to feel like, "Fuck,

18
00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:53.270
I'm going to ruin the conversation because I can't
communicate well enough or I can't understand everything

19
00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:59.360
this person is saying or my vocabulary isn't expansive
enough" or whatever it is, you know what I mean? So we

20
00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:05.080
already have those insecurities in our mind and then when we
get to the moment where we can't think of a word or a

21
00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:12.970
phrase, we kind of just get stuck like, "Oh shit." And what
a lot of people do, it's happened to me before, I'll be

22
00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:18.110
talking to somebody and they can't find the word or the
phrase that expresses their idea, They'll just say, "Ah,

23
00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:25.320
forget about it. Never mind." And the problem with that is,
like, nobody wins in that situation because now, I don't

24
00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:32.130
know what you were trying to say and I'll never know. Number
two is that subject is no longer up for discussion. You

25
00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:38.320
basically just said, "Ah, fuck the conversation." And number
three, you never learned what it is you were trying to say.

26
00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:44.080
You can't be helped if you don't let somebody help you, you
know? And I...I understand that a lot of people are afraid

27
00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:50.330
to ask for help from somebody that's not a teacher. But what
you got to understand is everybody's a teacher because

28
00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:56.330
everybody knows something that you don't. So you cannot be
afraid to ask for help, especially when it's like, "Help me

29
00:02:56.330 --> 00:03:02.110
find the word I'm looking for." You know what I'm saying?
Like, I understand the insecurity or the fear behind doing

30
00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:09.050
something like that, but it's really no big deal, man. It's
really no big deal. It's the only way you're gonna learn as

31
00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:17.280
well, you know? It's actually the best way to learn because
the same way that talking to yourself is beneficial. Having

32
00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:23.610
a conversation with somebody and not knowing how to say
something is equally beneficial because now we're engaged in

33
00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:29.400
a conversation, we're connecting in some kind of way, and
you need a word or phrase in that moment and you don't have

34
00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:34.960
it. So then when I give it to you, now you have context, you
have a memory, because we were having this conversation. So

35
00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:41.650
it's connected to something, an experience that you had with
me as opposed to just reading it in a book and trying to

36
00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:48.270
memorize it again and again and again. You actually were in
a situation where you needed to have it, so you're much more

37
00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:54.150
likely to remember it, and it's a much more natural way of
learning the language, I think. But anyway, let me get back

38
00:03:54.150 --> 00:04:00.850
to my point. The tip or the recommendation I have for you in
situations like that where you're talking to somebody and

39
00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:07.050
for whatever reason you just can't remember the word, your
mind just *poof* loses the word or the expression for

40
00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:13.860
whatever reason, what you can do is simply describe the
idea. Maybe you don't have the word or the exact phrasal

41
00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:19.920
verb or the expression or whatever it is, but you should
just describe the idea to the person. And as a native

42
00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:26.430
speaker, they should be able to help you find the word or
expression or phrase that you're looking for. And this is

43
00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:32.660
one of the reasons that I spend so much time explaining
things, or at least I try to explain things in great detail

44
00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:38.360
and a lot of times I overexplain very simple ideas and
things like that, but it's because I want it to be crystal

45
00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:45.210
clear in your mind the idea of a particular word,
expression, phrase, cultural reference or whatever it is. So

46
00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:52.430
sometimes I notice that I'll explain the same thing two or
three times and maybe two or three different ways but what I

47
00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:57.750
believe is beneficial about that is that when you're
learning this word or this phrase or whatever it is, now you

48
00:04:57.750 --> 00:05:05.990
have a clear idea of not only what the word means, but how
it is used and why it is used. So in a situation where

49
00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:11.130
you're trying to think of this word or this phrase or
whatever it is, you can at least, hopefully, remember the

50
00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:12.750
idea of the word.

51
00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:18.310
You can have a vision in your mind of what this action is,
even though you can't think of the word. So in moments like

52
00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:25.180
that, what you can do is describe the action and a native
speaker has been speaking the language their whole lives, so

53
00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:31.720
they're much more likely to be able to hear a description of
a word or a phrase or an idea and think of the word that

54
00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:37.680
matches. Hopefully I'm making sense here. So let me just
give you a simple example. Me and you were talking and

55
00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:45.130
you're trying to tell me about your morning, right? And you
can't think of the phrasal verb "get up", just an example.

56
00:05:45.890 --> 00:05:52.050
And you're like, "Man, I know what I did. I can see it in my
mind. I just can't think of the word." So what you can do is

57
00:05:52.050 --> 00:06:00.380
just describe it to me. Say, "Man, what's the first thing
you do in the morning?" And just me, naturally, I start to

58
00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:07.600
ask myself, "I guess I get up." Yeah, "Get up. Exactly. So I
got up 6:00, and..." Ba ba ba ba ba ba. Then you start to

59
00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:13.750
tell me your story. Nobody was hurt. Nobody died. Didn't
kill the conversation. Nobody's embarrassed or anything like

60
00:06:13.750 --> 00:06:20.650
that. You simply describe the idea to me, and I help you
find the words. It's really that simple. Or another example.

61
00:06:21.330 --> 00:06:28.680
Let's say we're talking about, um, a football game that you
saw on TV, and it was just an amazing game. So many talented

62
00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:33.750
players. It was great. It was amazing. And you're trying to
find this particular word. You're like, "Man, Cristiano

63
00:06:33.750 --> 00:06:40.130
Ronaldo is like, he's a really, he's a good player but
there's another word I'm looking for. I can't remember it.

64
00:06:40.430 --> 00:06:46.720
What's the word for when you see somebody talented and they
do something crazy and you go, 'Wow!'" Now you just

65
00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:52.770
described the idea of the word that you're looking for. When
I hear that, I'm like, "I guess impressive? You were

66
00:06:52.770 --> 00:06:59.280
impressed?" "Yeah, exactly. Impressive. His talent is very,
very impressive. I was impressed." Now, maybe these aren't

67
00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:04.810
the best examples. I didn't prepare them ahead of time. I'm
just thinking of them now as I'm talking to you. But

68
00:07:04.810 --> 00:07:09.840
hopefully I'm making sense and hopefully you can get the
idea. Very simple thing that you can do to move your

69
00:07:09.840 --> 00:07:17.230
conversations forward or make sure they don't die or end
simply because you can't think of a word is just describe

70
00:07:17.870 --> 00:07:25.080
the word or the idea or whatever, or the action, whatever it
is. So in the future, if you're not already doing it,

71
00:07:25.080 --> 00:07:30.870
whenever you learn words and phrases, especially verbs,
especially phrasal verbs and things like that, try to keep

72
00:07:30.870 --> 00:07:39.620
in your mind an image or, not a video, but a visualization,
a visual representation of the verb, of the action, because

73
00:07:39.620 --> 00:07:45.800
that's going to help you remember those words and attach
them mentally to the actions. But also when you can't

74
00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:52.160
remember the phrasal verb, you can at least describe the
idea. And that's why it's so important to consume a bunch of

75
00:07:52.160 --> 00:07:58.470
things in English, you know, to listen to these podcasts, to
listen to the explanations, to understand the idea, the

76
00:07:58.470 --> 00:08:04.180
visual idea behind, especially verbs, but just ideas in
general. Because there will be times when you simply forget

77
00:08:04.180 --> 00:08:11.140
words and a simple little thing you can do is just describe
the word to the person. And most native speakers, if not all

78
00:08:11.140 --> 00:08:16.840
of them, will get the idea and help you find the word that
you're looking for. So two things happen: you get the

79
00:08:16.840 --> 00:08:23.410
vocabulary, you remember, or you learn the word that you
need to express that idea, and the conversation just keeps

80
00:08:23.410 --> 00:08:25.050
going. No big deal.

81
00:08:26.600 --> 00:08:34.340
So hopefully my little tip or recommendation or explanation
was clear enough for you to understand the idea of what I

82
00:08:34.340 --> 00:08:39.820
was trying to express. If you find yourself in a situation
where you just can't remember a word or a phrase, phrasal

83
00:08:39.820 --> 00:08:47.180
verb, whatever it is, just describe the idea. And now, if
you're not already doing it, in the future, make an effort

84
00:08:47.510 --> 00:08:54.270
to really understand the idea of words and phrases and
things like that. Don't just try to learn words. Try to

85
00:08:54.270 --> 00:09:00.880
learn the context and try to have a visualization or a
visual representation of every word or phrase, phrasal verb

86
00:09:01.350 --> 00:09:06.710
that you learn. I think it's really going to help you
remember things more, but also have better conversations

87
00:09:06.710 --> 00:09:11.290
because you're not thinking so much and you're not so
nervous about the fact that you can't remember certain words

88
00:09:11.290 --> 00:09:16.680
or phrases. Just describe it to the person you're talking to
and if they're a native speaker, even if they're not,

89
00:09:17.020 --> 00:09:22.840
there's a high chance that they will be able to understand
the idea and give you the word that you're looking for. And

90
00:09:22.840 --> 00:09:27.570
even if they can't, as long as they can understand the idea
of what you're trying to say, most of the time, the

91
00:09:27.570 --> 00:09:33.680
conversation can just continue. It's no big deal. Alright? 
So let me know in the comments if I was clear, if this

92
00:09:33.680 --> 00:09:38.840
little tip or recommendation, you know, you think it might
be useful to you or something like that, because I'm not

93
00:09:38.840 --> 00:09:46.910
really sure after talking all this time, but ah...hopefully
it helps you. Alright, but that's Coffee with Kaizen #12 in

94
00:09:46.910 --> 00:09:53.830
the books. I'll talk to you tomorrow.

95
00:09:55.850 --> 00:09:55.970
Peace!

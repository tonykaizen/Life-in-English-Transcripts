00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:03.940
What's up, everybody? You're listening to another episode of Life in English.

2
00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:07.730
I'm your host, Tony Kaizen. And in this episode,

3
00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:12.200
I'm going to share six simple reasons that you should learn English in a community.

4
00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:17.580
'Cause if you talk to anybody who's gone to a quality language school or anybody in my community,

5
00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:22.070
For example, any one of these people will be able to tell you that it is truly priceless

6
00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:26.680
To have 24/7 access to not only a teacher but also a community of people,

7
00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:31.420
A group of friends or classmates that are also trying to achieve the same goal that you have,

8
00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:33.730
Which is becoming fluent in this language.

9
00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:39.530
Anyone who has experienced this will be able to tell you that it makes all the difference in the learning process.

10
00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:41.550
So in this episode, like I said,

11
00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:45.530
I'm just going to share six simple reasons that you should consider doing the same exact thing.

12
00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:48.340
But first, roll the intro.

13
00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:56.250
All right, my friends, we're not going to waste any time.

14
00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:58.760
I'm going to get straight into these six very simple

15
00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:02.350
But very clear reasons that you should learn English in a community.

16
00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:06.960
Number one, the more people you have to study with, the better.

17
00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:09.420
Number one is a very simple reason.

18
00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:11.840
I'm a firm believer in the idea that you only need

19
00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:16.560
One quality language exchange partner to become fluent in any language.

20
00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:21.210
I mean, I learned to speak Portuguese by talking to just two people on a regular basis.

21
00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:25.340
Now, obviously, I talked to a lot more than two during my entire learning process,

22
00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:27.490
And I'm still learning today. I learn new things all the time.

23
00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:35.700
But I only had two consistent like, daily partners for like two or three years.

24
00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:38.540
And I still learned to speak the language at a pretty,

25
00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:41.620
What I consider a pretty high level. You see what I'm saying?

26
00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:49.300
So don't think that you have to have a bunch of people to talk to on a regular basis if you want to improve this skill.

27
00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:54.010
But what I'm saying is there are many times when you might find one or two really cool people,

28
00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:57.800
But maybe they're busy a lot. They have other things to do or whatever,

29
00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:01.540
But when that happens, you're kind of stuck. You can practice by yourself,

30
00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:06.200
But if you want somebody else to talk to, then you need more people. So the more, the better.

31
00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:10.150
And in a community, when you have, you know, even if it's just ten people,

32
00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:16.090
That's ten separate chances that you have to practice your English with a real person, you know?

33
00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:22.220
Because the simple equation is like this, more people equals more opportunities,

34
00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:25.640
Equals more practice, equals better English. That's the idea.

35
00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:27.710
So when you have more people in this community,

36
00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:31.250
You have more chances to practice with real people on a regular basis.

37
00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:38.630
And I can't see the downside or the negative side to having more opportunities to do what it is you want to do.

38
00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:42.140
You know what I'm saying? So the more people, the better. Just remember that.

39
00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:46.230
Now, reason number two that you should learn English in the community is that

40
00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:51.240
It prepares you for real-world situations. Siturations, he said.

41
00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:54.220
Siturations is not a word. Don't say that.

42
00:02:54.550 --> 00:03:00.590
Situations. Real-world situations. That's what I was trying to say.

43
00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:03.440
A community prepares you for that. You know what I'm saying?

44
00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:07.910
Because you're most likely, in the real world,

45
00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:13.020
Come into contact with all kinds of English speakers, not just native English speakers.

46
00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:19.880
Even though most English schools and most independent teachers prepare you for speaking with British people

47
00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:25.640
Or American people in most cases. But the reality is, the entire world is learning English.

48
00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:29.070
You see what I'm saying? So you're almost certainly going to come in contact...

49
00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:34.340
Come into contact with people who speak English as a second or third or fourth or maybe fifth language.

50
00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:38.940
And it's just as important to understand them as it is to understand the native speaker.

51
00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:42.160
You see what I'm saying? So when you join the international community,

52
00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:47.130
It prepares you for what real life is actually going to be like, especially if you come to the US.

53
00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:51.910
There are hundreds, hundreds of millions of people who speak English as a second language

54
00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:53.640
And you're going to have to interact with those people.

55
00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:57.800
So by joining an international community and talking to myself, the native,

56
00:03:57.820 --> 00:03:59.510
But also other people from other countries,

57
00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:04.120
You're constantly preparing yourself for real-world situations. You know?

58
00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:08.270
It's a big world out there and a lot of different kinds of accents and dialects and word choice,

59
00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:14.210
You know, communication styles as well. So I think by joining a community,

60
00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:20.200
You get much more realistic preparation, much better preparation for real life

61
00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:23.540
When you're really going to be using this real English, you know?

62
00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:28.560
So reason number three that you should join a community if you're trying to learn the language,

63
00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:34.250
In this case, English is because you're forced to grow as a person and not just a communicator. I said that wrong.

64
00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:38.610
You're forced to grow as a person and not just a language learner. That's what I meant to say.

65
00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:42.760
Because one of the coolest things to me about learning a language is that you're forced

66
00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:47.360
To improve crucial communication skills that will serve you for years to come.

67
00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:53.190
And one of those skills is the ability to have healthy discussions and healthy debates with pretty much anyone.

68
00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:56.920
Because at some point you're going to come across somebody that has like different thoughts

69
00:04:56.920 --> 00:05:01.410
Or opinions or life experiences or philosophy or religious beliefs,

70
00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:04.070
Something that's much different from the way you live your life.

71
00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:05.870
Eventually, you're going to come across that.

72
00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:11.770
And when you're doing a language exchange and you find yourself in that situation, what are you going to do?

73
00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:17.110
Just end the conversation and say, "Fuck you. You're stupid" or block the person or curse them out.

74
00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:22.580
Like, of course not. Of course not. You can learn how to express your thoughts more accurately,

75
00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:25.440
And you're going to learn how to respect the thoughts and opinions,

76
00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:28.810
And lifestyles of other people, even if they're completely different from your own.

77
00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:34.930
Because that's the only way you can sustain long-term communication with anyone, in my opinion.

78
00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:39.000
And sustaining long-term communication is how you become fluent in a language.

79
00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:43.450
You have to have someone to talk to on a regular basis for an extended period of time.

80
00:05:44.090 --> 00:05:47.610
And once you master this skill of being able to have healthy debates

81
00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:50.000
And discussions with people from different walks of life,

82
00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:52.680
Different social classes, people that look different than you,

83
00:05:53.150 --> 00:05:59.280
once you master the skill you give yourself the opportunity to see how diverse the world really is.

84
00:05:59.890 --> 00:06:03.420
You get a chance to learn about different ways of life and different ways of seeing the world.

85
00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:07.890
And you get a chance to make friends all over the world, like in different countries.

86
00:06:08.790 --> 00:06:15.830
And I just cannot stress enough like, how priceless that actually is,

87
00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:20.650
To have friends all over the world that are united with you by the...

88
00:06:20.710 --> 00:06:24.810
You know, with this language, let's say. It's a really priceless thing to have, man.

89
00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:28.840
Anyone who's traveled to a foreign country by themselves can tell you like,

90
00:06:29.030 --> 00:06:33.710
How priceless it is to have friends everywhere. You know what I mean?

91
00:06:33.710 --> 00:06:38.280
So that's just another reason I think to join a community is because you grow as a person,

92
00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:42.760
You know, internally just as much as you do, let's say linguistically,

93
00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:45.280
By improving your language skills. Okay?

94
00:06:45.390 --> 00:06:48.970
So let's move on to reason number four that you should join a community

95
00:06:48.970 --> 00:06:53.940
And that is the other members of the community hold you accountable. This one is extremely important.

96
00:06:54.640 --> 00:06:59.990
Like, have you ever noticed that going to the gym is a whole lot easier when you have a partner to go with?

97
00:07:01.620 --> 00:07:05.730
Why is that? I think it's because you have someone who holds you accountable.

98
00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:10.520
Like, you know you got someone expecting you to show up. And for some strange reason,

99
00:07:10.520 --> 00:07:14.920
It's much harder for us to let other people down than it is for us to let ourselves down.

100
00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:21.990
That's why multiple partners or friends that support you and your goals are priceless assets to have.

101
00:07:22.350 --> 00:07:26.390
Trust me on that. Because if you don't have a partner and you decid... Or excuse me,

102
00:07:26.390 --> 00:07:30.840
You decide to skip the gym today, no one's going to know about it except you.

103
00:07:31.930 --> 00:07:36.960
But if you flake on your partner, they will most likely expect some type of explanation like,

104
00:07:36.960 --> 00:07:39.020
Yo, man, where the fuck were you at? I was calling you.

105
00:07:39.020 --> 00:07:43.020
You know we go to the gym every Wednesday, every Friday. What's up? Where were you?

106
00:07:43.580 --> 00:07:45.920
Right? And simply knowing this fact,

107
00:07:45.920 --> 00:07:49.370
Knowing that somebody is going to be expecting an explanation if you flake,

108
00:07:49.370 --> 00:07:54.160
If you don't show up, simply knowing that can be enough to make you get up and go to the gym,

109
00:07:54.210 --> 00:07:59.550
Even if you really don't want to do it. Right? It's the same with language.

110
00:08:00.500 --> 00:08:03.580
I think that practicing your language skills is the same as going to the gym.

111
00:08:03.580 --> 00:08:06.960
Except in this case you're exercising your mind and not your body.

112
00:08:06.960 --> 00:08:11.080
And when you have partners holding you accountable and expecting you to show up,

113
00:08:11.360 --> 00:08:15.000
You're much more motivated to show up and practice your English every day.

114
00:08:16.480 --> 00:08:21.370
Members of your community are a constant reminder that you need to practice and improve this particular skill.

115
00:08:23.280 --> 00:08:26.760
And they say that you are the sum of the five people you spend the most time with.

116
00:08:27.640 --> 00:08:29.960
So if you don't have people in your life that are holding you accountable

117
00:08:29.960 --> 00:08:37.990
And supporting you and your goals, you are at a distinct disadvantage. In my opinion. All right?

118
00:08:38.530 --> 00:08:42.210
So let's move on to the fifth reason that you should learn English in a community.

119
00:08:42.500 --> 00:08:48.720
And that is learning with real people is just more fun. Going back to the example of athletics,

120
00:08:48.800 --> 00:08:56.470
For example, could you imagine if basketball were a one-player sport? What about soccer?

121
00:08:58.550 --> 00:09:03.100
Imagine LeBron James on the court all by himself just shooting the ball and dribbling in circles.

122
00:09:04.010 --> 00:09:08.090
Imagine Messi on the field running back and forth and just shooting the ball into an empty net.

123
00:09:09.710 --> 00:09:13.420
Now, we'd probably see them do some amazing stuff by themselves because they're really talented players,

124
00:09:13.860 --> 00:09:16.000
But after a while it would get pretty boring, right?

125
00:09:17.710 --> 00:09:20.210
That's because basketball and soccer are team sports.

126
00:09:21.560 --> 00:09:24.210
They're meant to be played and enjoyed with other people.

127
00:09:26.220 --> 00:09:30.490
Well, it's the same thing with language. Communication is a team sport.

128
00:09:31.740 --> 00:09:34.390
And when you learn a language in a community, you have more fun simply

129
00:09:34.390 --> 00:09:39.240
Because you're using the language the way it was intended to be used, with other people.

130
00:09:41.330 --> 00:09:43.830
And we don't learn languages so we can talk to ourselves,

131
00:09:43.970 --> 00:09:46.760
Even though there's absolutely nothing wrong with talking to yourself.

132
00:09:47.130 --> 00:09:48.860
Don't let anyone tell you different. All right?

133
00:09:49.700 --> 00:09:52.680
But we learn languages to communicate with other people, right?

134
00:09:52.680 --> 00:09:55.840
And for some strange reason, many English schools

135
00:09:55.840 --> 00:10:01.550
And independent teachers focus on a language learning methodology that isn't practical for learning a language.

136
00:10:02.980 --> 00:10:05.780
They try to get you to learn how to express yourself by studying words

137
00:10:05.780 --> 00:10:09.030
And grammar rules the same way you would study mathematic equations.

138
00:10:10.440 --> 00:10:15.200
But math is a science. Language and communication are forms of art.

139
00:10:18.080 --> 00:10:22.640
So when you put down the grammar books and decide to start interacting with a community of real people,

140
00:10:22.970 --> 00:10:27.330
I can guarantee that you'll start to see better results in your ability to comprehend

141
00:10:27.690 --> 00:10:38.350
And speak the English language, and you'll have a lot more fun doing it.

142
00:10:38.430 --> 00:10:44.600
All right. Let's get on to the sixth and final reason that you should join a community if you're trying to learn English

143
00:10:45.500 --> 00:10:49.210
And that is you get to share your growth and your process with other people.

144
00:10:50.860 --> 00:10:52.910
It's really cool to see someone grow and develop over time,

145
00:10:52.910 --> 00:10:55.980
And it's even cooler to be a part of their growth process.

146
00:10:56.630 --> 00:10:58.970
And it's also really nice to share your growth with other people.

147
00:10:59.930 --> 00:11:03.260
And I know it might sound cliche, but it's great to be a part of something.

148
00:11:04.700 --> 00:11:11.440
I can't think of any disadvantages of being a member of a community that exists to help you grow as a communicator and a person.

149
00:11:13.160 --> 00:11:17.180
I mean, if you think like this podcast, for example, this is why I recommend to everyone I know,

150
00:11:17.620 --> 00:11:21.890
Anyone learning a language to just start a podcast, even if no one listens to it.

151
00:11:22.080 --> 00:11:23.990
Who gives a shit? It's really not the point.

152
00:11:24.590 --> 00:11:28.890
But by doing that, just every day, every week, every month, whatever works for you,

153
00:11:29.220 --> 00:11:35.850
But by consistently recording podcast episodes in this language you're trying to learn or in my case,

154
00:11:35.850 --> 00:11:41.170
In this language I'm trying to teach, it's just like, you get a way to track your progress and your growth.

155
00:11:41.170 --> 00:11:49.430
I can go back to episode number one and see my growth and progress all the way up to Episode 133. You know?

156
00:11:49.430 --> 00:11:52.000
And if I would have kept the same record in Spanish or Portuguese,

157
00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:55.980
I'd have that same documentation of my growth and my progress.

158
00:11:55.980 --> 00:11:58.140
And it's just really cool to be able to look back and see that.

159
00:11:58.440 --> 00:12:00.310
It's really cool to be able to share that with other people.

160
00:12:00.310 --> 00:12:04.710
Because when I go back and listen to my podcast from a year ago and compare it today,

161
00:12:05.500 --> 00:12:09.590
That's an experience for me. But I'm also sharing it with all of you that are listening and watching,

162
00:12:09.590 --> 00:12:11.470
All of you that have been following for years now,

163
00:12:12.050 --> 00:12:17.670
you have seen the evolution of the Life in English podcast and myself as well.

164
00:12:17.780 --> 00:12:22.490
And it's just... I think it's a rich thing to be able to share your stories and experiences with other people.

165
00:12:22.490 --> 00:12:27.430
That's why we like documentaries. That's why we like books, biographies, stories, and things like that.

166
00:12:27.730 --> 00:12:32.840
For the same reason, you know, you get to live this experience, you get to witness this growth,

167
00:12:33.330 --> 00:12:37.460
You know, through somebody else's experience. And to me, that's priceless. You know?

168
00:12:38.240 --> 00:12:43.090
When you can share like... Because we have members in the community right now who are at the more beginner stages

169
00:12:43.090 --> 00:12:48.100
And I can guarantee you six months from now, if we just continue doing what we're doing, talking every day,

170
00:12:48.100 --> 00:12:52.290
Every week, and they're listening to the podcast and all these other things that language learners do,

171
00:12:52.750 --> 00:12:57.240
I guarantee you in six months we'll be able to look back at the conversations we had last week,

172
00:12:57.240 --> 00:13:00.180
For example, and see a clear difference. You know?

173
00:13:00.870 --> 00:13:05.030
And I think you appreciate your process much more when you can look back and see how far you've come,

174
00:13:05.630 --> 00:13:08.800
When you have other members reminding you how far you've come, you know?

175
00:13:08.800 --> 00:13:13.380
And when you get to see these new friends that you have around the world also learning and growing with you

176
00:13:13.700 --> 00:13:17.000
And you know that you were a part of that. I just think it's really cool.

177
00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:19.060
Some people don't really care about stuff like that.

178
00:13:19.060 --> 00:13:24.750
But I think when it comes to doing something difficult and time-consuming and energy-consuming,

179
00:13:24.750 --> 00:13:27.950
Like learning a language, it's always so much better when you do it with other people.

180
00:13:28.620 --> 00:13:30.580
And that's true for any skill you're trying to learn, I think.

181
00:13:30.580 --> 00:13:33.580
When you can share your growth and your progress with other people,

182
00:13:34.160 --> 00:13:37.460
The experience is just richer for me. You know?

183
00:13:37.460 --> 00:13:43.360
So, anyway. Those are the six reasons I think that you should learn English in a community.

184
00:13:43.400 --> 00:13:47.490
Let me just recap. Number one, the more people you have to talk to, the better.

185
00:13:47.550 --> 00:13:51.700
There is no downside to having an abundance of opportunities to practice your English

186
00:13:51.700 --> 00:13:53.850
If you're trying to learn how to speak English. Right?

187
00:13:54.140 --> 00:13:57.560
Number two, a community prepares you for real-world situations.

188
00:13:57.870 --> 00:14:00.410
There are more than just native speakers in this world that speak English,

189
00:14:00.450 --> 00:14:04.050
And you need to be able to interact with and understand natives and non-natives.

190
00:14:04.200 --> 00:14:05.570
There is no difference to me. Okay?

191
00:14:05.990 --> 00:14:09.590
Number three, you're forced to grow as a person, not just a language learner.

192
00:14:09.590 --> 00:14:12.710
Because it's great to become fluent in the English language.

193
00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:18.210
But it's even better to use that language to facilitate growth in other areas of your life

194
00:14:18.550 --> 00:14:21.490
By talking to people from different walks of life, with different beliefs

195
00:14:21.490 --> 00:14:24.140
Or thought processes or philosophies, or whatever it is,

196
00:14:24.590 --> 00:14:28.580
You just grow in other ways that go far beyond language itself.

197
00:14:28.820 --> 00:14:30.240
And I think that's really, really valuable.

198
00:14:30.720 --> 00:14:33.130
Number four, other members hold you accountable.

199
00:14:33.800 --> 00:14:37.910
And this is important because sometimes if we leave everything up to ourselves

200
00:14:38.100 --> 00:14:41.730
And we're only accountable for ourselves, it's easy to let ourselves slide

201
00:14:41.770 --> 00:14:46.420
Or let ourselves skip a day or skip a week or skip a month. It's very easy to do that.

202
00:14:46.420 --> 00:14:50.080
But when you have people holding you accountable or expecting you to show up consistently,

203
00:14:50.450 --> 00:14:53.700
Sometimes that's all the motivation you need to actually show up consistently

204
00:14:54.260 --> 00:14:56.470
And practice this skill. It makes a huge difference.

205
00:14:56.930 --> 00:15:00.240
The fifth reason, learning with real people is just more fun than sitting

206
00:15:00.240 --> 00:15:04.910
And trying to memorize vocabulary in a book or watching movie after movie after movie.

207
00:15:05.300 --> 00:15:09.290
Having real people to talk to just makes the process more fun, more engaging.

208
00:15:09.290 --> 00:15:12.880
And the sixth and final reason is that you get to share your growth

209
00:15:12.880 --> 00:15:15.300
And your progress with other people and they get to share it with you,

210
00:15:15.690 --> 00:15:21.030
Which creates a much more meaningful experience and growth process, I think.

211
00:15:21.540 --> 00:15:23.950
Now, at this point, I'm pretty sure you know what's coming next.

212
00:15:23.950 --> 00:15:27.010
I got to talk about my community, one of the best places, I think,

213
00:15:27.450 --> 00:15:30.390
To improve your English with real people like myself.

214
00:15:30.390 --> 00:15:35.500
So if you like the idea of learning English in a community with real people, if you want,

215
00:15:35.930 --> 00:15:38.620
You know, a place where you can come and get your questions answered

216
00:15:38.620 --> 00:15:40.770
And make friends from around the world, you know,

217
00:15:40.770 --> 00:15:44.930
Get access to the transcripts of every episode of this podcast, vocabulary guides,

218
00:15:45.630 --> 00:15:48.890
all the content and support that you need to learn English by yourself.

219
00:15:49.490 --> 00:15:51.930
Or I guess technically it wouldn't be by yourself because you'd be learning with us,

220
00:15:52.270 --> 00:15:55.160
if you're interested in joining the Life in English community,

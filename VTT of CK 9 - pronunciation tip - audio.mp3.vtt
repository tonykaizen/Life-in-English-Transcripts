00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:08.800
Here is an interesting English pronunciation tip. Good
morning, my friend.

2
00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:15.920
This is Coffee with Kaizen #9, and like I said in the intro,
I'm just going to share a quick little interesting English

3
00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:23.090
pronunciation tip with you that I thought could be helpful.
And that tip or this recommendation, let's say, is that you

4
00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:27.950
pay attention to words that end with the suffix a-g-e.

5
00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:35.920
A-g-e, because they don't all sound the same. So what I
noticed and what's really interesting is that if the word is

6
00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:45.590
a one syllable word, and it ends in a-g-e, the a-g-e in that
word make an "age" sound like the word

7
00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:52.690
"age" or "page" or "wage" or "rage" or "sage".

8
00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:59.440
All of these words have one syllable, and the last three
letters are a-g-e and it makes an /ā/ (ey) sound: "age".

9
00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:06.660
Now, if the word has more than one syllable, in many cases,
it makes an "edge" sound.

10
00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:16.640
So let me give you some examples: savage, homage, leverage,
bandage,

11
00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:26.980
luggage, average, footage, mileage, package,

12
00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:36.400
cabbage, advantage, encourage, language.

13
00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:43.220
So as you can see, in all of those words there...they're all
two syllable words and they all end with that same suffix -

14
00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:50.770
a-g-e, but they don't make an "age" sound; it's more like an
"edge" sound. I'm not saying "savage", "luggage",

15
00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:57.860
"language", "encourage", you see what I mean? The same
letters, different sound just because...I shouldn't say

16
00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:06.230
because, but different sound, and it just so happens that or
coincidentally, they're words that have more than one

17
00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:11.250
syllable. I don't know if that's the reason that the
pronunciation changes, but it's just something that I

18
00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:17.840
noticed the other day that's really interesting. Now, there
are exceptions to this rule -- there are always exceptions

19
00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:23.010
in the English language -- for example, "garage". "Garage".

20
00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:29.610
Also a two syllable word that ends with the suffix a-g-e,
but it doesn't make an "age" sound; it doesn't make an

21
00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:35.790
"edge" sound. It's an /ə/ (ah): "garage" or "camouflage" or
"sabotage".

22
00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:41.560
Right? All of these have more than one syllable, and they
don't make the /ā/ (ey) or the [ɛ] (eh) sound. It's an /ə/

23
00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:42.850
(ah), you see?

24
00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:50.820
Now, one other interesting exception is "engage". Two
syllables, but it makes the /ā/ (ey) sound: "engage". It's

25
00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:53.520
not "engage". It's not "engage".

26
00:02:53.520 --> 00:03:00.180
"Engage". But all the other two syllable words on the list
that I gave you: "language", "encourage", "advantage",

27
00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:07.160
"cabbage", "package", "savage". They're also two syllables,
but it's not an /ā/ (ey) or an /ə/ (ah); it's an [ɛ] (eh).

28
00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:14.380
So, I don't want you to get too, you know, stressed out and
anxious about this whole thing, like, "Oh my God, this

29
00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:20.880
pronunciation thing makes no sense. How am I going to learn?
How am I going to become fluent?" Don't worry about it.

30
00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:26.570
Alright? Do not stress about something like this. It's just
an interesting detail that I noticed and something that you

31
00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:33.140
can start to pay attention to in your daily conversations,
or when you're reading or listening to other people say

32
00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:39.550
words that end with the suffix a-g-e. Okay? Cos at the end
of the day, like I said, the main thing that you can

33
00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:48.840
remember or take away from this episode is that one syllable
words that end with a-g-e, almost every time, you're going

34
00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:57.620
to pronounce it "age": "page", "wage", "rage", "sage", etc.
Almost every time. Now, words that have more than one

35
00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:03.950
syllable and end in a-g-e, almost every time, it's an "edge"
sound.

36
00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:11.450
Not an "age" or an "age", but most of the time it's "edge":
"homage", "footage", "package", "cabbage", "average",

37
00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:17.940
"language", almost every time. Now there will be exceptions,
a few words here or there that don't follow that same

38
00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:24.200
pattern, but that's okay. Alright? We'll almost certainly
still be able to understand you. It almost certainly won't

39
00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:29.910
ruin the conversation. I hope and I imagine people won't be
laughing at you because you said "language" instead of

40
00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:36.230
"language". It's no big deal. So don't stress about it. Just
a little piece of information for you that I thought might

41
00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:42.620
be helpful. And maybe in your own studies, you can think of
some way to remember these patterns and even the exceptions

42
00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:50.070
of those patterns. Alright? Cool. That's it for now, man.
Hopefully, like I said, I haven't confused you even more or

43
00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:55.740
giving you more stress and anxiety on your language learning
journey. But if you have any questions or doubts, man, like

44
00:04:55.740 --> 00:05:00.680
I always say, leave a comment if you're watching this on
YouTube or shoot me a message if you're just listening to

45
00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:08.630
this, man. But that is Coffee with Kaizen #9 in the books.
So, I'll talk to you tomorrow. Peace!

00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:02.580
Idioms are for idiots.

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:08.130
All right.

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:11.700
Good morning, my friend, this is Coffee with Kaizen number 24.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.910
And like I said in the title, I want you to know that idioms are for fucking idiots.

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:21.800
Now, hopefully, you know the title is not meant to be taken seriously.

00:00:21.825 --> 00:00:25.785
I'm not saying that you're an idiot for wanting to learn idioms.

00:00:25.785 --> 00:00:31.335
I'm not saying you're an idiot if you use idioms in your daily conversations and things like that.

00:00:31.575 --> 00:00:40.455
But the message or the point of this episode is something that I think a lot
of learners of English don't understand, but desperately need to understand.

00:00:40.455 --> 00:00:46.425
Because not just in my podcast episodes, but also the videos I post online and social media and stuff like that,

00:00:46.695 --> 00:00:50.715
a lot of people are always asking, can you teach us more idioms?

00:00:50.715 --> 00:00:52.065
Can you teach us more slang?

00:00:52.275 --> 00:00:55.155
Can you teach us how to sound more natural and things like that.

00:00:55.515 --> 00:01:00.440
But what I think a lot of people that don't understand about slang or idioms

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:03.440
or whatever you want to call them, expressions and things like that

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:07.760
is even natives, we don't use them as much as you think we do.

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:12.440
Just like I imagine in your native language, if you stop for a second and just think

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:15.830
you're not using idioms, like all day, every day,

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:19.280
you're not using expressions or slang all day, every day.

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:23.930
In most cases, obviously everyone's different, but in most cases you're really not.

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:26.580
And let me give you an example of exactly what I'm talking about.

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.290
I got up at the crack of dawn because the early bird gets the worm

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.720
and you gotta make hay while the sun is shining.

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:37.950
So I took the train to work and I had my nose to the grindstone all day.

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:42.930
I didn't eat lunch, but I had a lot of fruit because an apple a day keeps the doctor away.

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:48.030
And I couldn't wait to get off work and come home because you know, home is where the heart is.

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:51.590
Nobody talks like that.

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:57.164
Like, basically that entire paragraph was nothing but different idioms and expressions.

00:01:57.405 --> 00:01:58.664
And it makes sense...

00:01:59.615 --> 00:02:00.285
makes sense.

00:02:00.524 --> 00:02:02.505
But it sounds forced.

00:02:02.505 --> 00:02:03.465
It sounds strange.

00:02:03.495 --> 00:02:04.304
Just unnatural.

00:02:04.304 --> 00:02:05.475
Nobody talks like that.

00:02:05.685 --> 00:02:11.655
Nobody uses that many idioms or expressions in every single sentence of every conversation.

00:02:11.984 --> 00:02:12.615
You see what I'm saying?

00:02:13.155 --> 00:02:16.215
It's just not natural, you know.

00:02:16.215 --> 00:02:23.850
So I can understand the desire to learn idioms and expressions and slang and things like that because you want to sound like a native.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:31.590
You want to sound more natural, but what you need to understand is what actually sounds natural is being understood.

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:32.940
That's natural.

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:37.950
And you don't need idioms or expressions or slang for that to happen.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.760
In fact, it's actually better if you don't focus on those things.

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:46.429
Because what I'm trying to say is a lot of people who are learning English

00:02:47.059 --> 00:02:50.540
and are constantly asking, "can you teach us idioms expressions and slang?"

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:59.790
Most of the time, those same people can't even express themselves clearly or concisely in a conversation with another person.

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:01.020
You see what I'm saying?

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:02.880
So it's like, they're trying to learn something that is,

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:09.690
we can say, intermediate or advanced level when they can't even do the basic stuff.

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:10.920
You know?

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:14.840
So really what I'm trying to say is you have to crawl before you walk.

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:20.505
And you have to walk before you jog, and jog before you run, and run before you sprint.

00:03:21.735 --> 00:03:23.655
Learning happens in stages, I think.

00:03:23.685 --> 00:03:26.745
And a lot of people try to skip the fundamental stages

00:03:26.745 --> 00:03:32.745
because they just want to get to the fun, more advanced, you know, natural or native speech.

00:03:33.075 --> 00:03:37.845
But what you got to understand is natives on a daily basis in my language, and most likely yours,

00:03:38.295 --> 00:03:41.075
we use very simple language on a day-to-day basis.

00:03:41.075 --> 00:03:41.535
We're not...

00:03:42.415 --> 00:03:46.454
You know, idioms and like slang and expressions, even curse words and things like that,

00:03:46.695 --> 00:03:47.805
it's kind of like salt.

00:03:49.035 --> 00:03:49.965
Let me give you an example.

00:03:49.965 --> 00:03:51.075
So just follow me for a second.

00:03:51.315 --> 00:03:53.025
It's kind of like salt on your food.

00:03:53.864 --> 00:03:56.114
Salt can do amazing things for food.

00:03:56.475 --> 00:03:59.865
Food without salt is very bland, right?

00:03:59.924 --> 00:04:04.905
It's um, the flavor is not as good as it is with salt, you know,

00:04:04.905 --> 00:04:07.635
food without salt for a lot of people, including myself is...

00:04:08.355 --> 00:04:09.825
blah, it's just missing something.

00:04:09.825 --> 00:04:12.795
It doesn't have a rich flavor, you see?

00:04:13.245 --> 00:04:20.084
But if you put salt on all your food, every single square inch of the food,

00:04:20.625 --> 00:04:24.615
on the fries and the chicken and the vegetables, I mean just coat all the food and salt,

00:04:24.855 --> 00:04:28.425
it's going to be disgusting, going to be too much to handle.

00:04:28.425 --> 00:04:30.195
It's too much salt.

00:04:30.795 --> 00:04:32.344
There is a such thing as too much salt.

00:04:32.655 --> 00:04:33.695
Hopefully, I'm making sense.

00:04:34.974 --> 00:04:39.060
And it's the same thing with slang, curse words, expressions, idioms, and all that.

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:44.910
It's meant to be placed into the conversation, let's say, tastefully, you know?

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:47.270
Here and there, not everywhere.

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:48.780
Just boom, a little bit there.

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:49.500
Boom.

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:52.620
A little bit there to give it a little bit of extra flavor.

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:59.610
It's meant to compliment the actual dish, the actual food, the substance of the meal.

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:02.159
The salt is not the substance, it's the complement.

00:05:02.619 --> 00:05:03.195
You know what I'm saying?

00:05:03.495 --> 00:05:08.565
So it's the same thing with idioms expressions, uh, slang, whatever you want to call it.

00:05:09.044 --> 00:05:11.534
We use it here and there when the time is right.

00:05:11.685 --> 00:05:14.234
So again, I'm not saying you're an idiot for wanting to learn slang.

00:05:14.265 --> 00:05:16.935
I'm not saying you're an idiot for wanting to learn idioms.

00:05:16.965 --> 00:05:18.945
I'm also not saying don't learn those things.

00:05:19.335 --> 00:05:20.145
That's not my point.

00:05:20.205 --> 00:05:21.075
That's not what I'm trying to say.

00:05:21.585 --> 00:05:24.794
I'm just saying, if you haven't mastered the basics,

00:05:25.664 --> 00:05:30.184
if you cannot comfortably just have a normal conversation with another person...

00:05:30.974 --> 00:05:31.414
you know,

00:05:32.205 --> 00:05:37.049
You really don't need to be focused on idioms and expressions and slang and 'sounding like a native'

00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:42.479
because your average native speaker uses very, very, very basic language on a day-to-day basis.

00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:48.239
So master that first and then move on to the 'fun' stuff, quote unquote.

00:05:48.479 --> 00:05:50.520
Like with every other skill, you know?

00:05:50.909 --> 00:05:55.650
You're not going to play like Messi, week number two of learning how to play soccer.

00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:56.130
You know?

00:05:56.130 --> 00:05:57.480
You gotta learn how to pass.

00:05:58.260 --> 00:05:58.800
You know what I'm saying?

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:00.390
Play with both feet, learn how to dribble.

00:06:00.570 --> 00:06:04.170
You trying to do all this extra fancy shit when you can't even do the basics.

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:05.820
So slow down.

00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:06.690
Be patient.

00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:12.450
Focus on the fundamentals, because that is the foundation of everything we say in any language.

00:06:12.990 --> 00:06:14.550
You gotta master the fundamentals.

00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:18.990
So don't worry too much about idioms, slang, expressions, stuff like that.

00:06:19.830 --> 00:06:24.075
The key to sounding natural is mastering the basics.

00:06:24.915 --> 00:06:30.225
So until you do that, you know, you really, in my opinion, this is just my humble opinion.

00:06:30.284 --> 00:06:33.075
You shouldn't be focused on anything other than that.

00:06:33.855 --> 00:06:34.215
All right.

00:06:34.275 --> 00:06:36.645
You gotta crawl before you walk.

00:06:47.635 --> 00:06:47.775
Peace.

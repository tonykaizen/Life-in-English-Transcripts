00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:05.420
In this episode, I'm going to explain the difference between the words job, work, and career.

2
00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:16.590
What's up, my friend? This is Coffee with Kaizen number 16. One, six, 16.

3
00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:19.530
And in this episode, like I said in the intro,

4
00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:23.200
I'm going to explain the difference between the words job, work, and career.

5
00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:27.360
Because these are three words that learners of English get confused quite often

6
00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:31.620
Because they're similar in a way, and they are all related to the same thing,

7
00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:35.260
But they don't mean the same thing. We don't use them in the same way.

8
00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:40.240
So in this episode, I'm going to teach you what they mean and exactly how we use them.

9
00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:43.830
Not only that, I'm also going to teach you some useful phrases that

10
00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:48.220
You can use in relation to your job, your work, and your career.

11
00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:51.110
All right? So we're not going to waste any more time.

12
00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:53.900
Let's get into this information.

13
00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:57.130
So let's start with 'job'. Job is a noun,

14
00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:00.380
And it refers to an activity that you do to receive money.

15
00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:05.800
Your job can also be referred to as your profession or your occupation.

16
00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:10.300
Now, the money that you receive for your job is called your salary.

17
00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:13.510
S A L A R Y, salary.

18
00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:17.950
And in some cases, your salary may be referred to as your compensation.

19
00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:24.090
And compensation in my opinion, is just a formal word for the reward

20
00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.780
You receive in exchange for doing something.

21
00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:31.460
Most of the time it's work, and most of the time that reward is money. Okay?

22
00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:35.840
So the compensation for your job is your salary or your money,

23
00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:39.250
The money that you receive to do your job. All right.

24
00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:45.000
So when someone is looking for a job, sometimes we call this the job hunt, right?

25
00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:46.750
H U N T, hunt.

26
00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:50.460
So if you're hunting for a job, think of it in the same way that

27
00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:53.090
You would hunt for an animal that you're trying to eat.

28
00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:57.120
If you're hunting for ducks or lions or deer, bucks...

29
00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:59.950
I don't know what people hunt for, but you get the idea.

30
00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:03.840
You're searching for something that you're trying to get, in this case.

31
00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.680
You're hunting for it. So that's why we call it the job hunt.

32
00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:09.490
And some people also just call it the job search.

33
00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:13.300
So if you or a friend let's say, it's a better example,

34
00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:15.780
If you know that your friend is looking for a job

35
00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:19.660
And they have been looking for a job for a few weeks or a few months,

36
00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.740
You can ask them, "How's the job hunt going?".

37
00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:25.260
Hey, man! How's the job hunt going?

38
00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:28.580
What you're asking them is how is the process of looking for a job?

39
00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:31.590
Are there any updates? Is there any news?

40
00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:34.360
Have you found a job? What's the status?

41
00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:35.550
That's basically what you're asking.

42
00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:37.960
So if you're trying to find a job,

43
00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:41.470
If you're searching for a job or if you're on the job hunt,

44
00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:45.190
You're most likely going to go to a jobs listing website,

45
00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:50.580
Which is simply a website where you can see a long list of all the current job openings.

46
00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:56.740
And job openings are basically positions that currently need to be filled at companies in your area.

47
00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:00.290
So if you're reading a job listing or if you talk to a company,

48
00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:02.790
A recruiter, an employer, or something like that,

49
00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:05.120
They might say "This position is opening",

50
00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:08.450
Which means they have a job opening. It's the same thing.

51
00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:13.600
Now, in each job listing, you will see what we call the job requirements,

52
00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:16.340
Which is basically the qualities, the skills,

53
00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:20.370
Or certifications that you need to qualify for that particular job.

54
00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:25.900
Now, once you have found a job opening or a job listing that's interesting to you,

55
00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:30.070
You will most likely need to fill out or complete a job application.

56
00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:34.860
Now, in some cases, you will also need to send the company your CV or your resume.

57
00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:38.080
And just so you know, CV and resume are interchangeable.

58
00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:40.200
In my mind, they both mean the same thing.

59
00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:45.760
It's that document that lists your academic qualifications or your past jobs,

60
00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:48.740
Your skills, what languages you speak, and things like that. Right?

61
00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:52.290
Now, this entire process of filling out the application

62
00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:56.590
And sending it to the company is what we call applying for the job.

63
00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:58.070
You're asking them for the job.

64
00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:01.890
Trying to show them that you're qualified to do that job. All right?

65
00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:05.940
So then you might get the opportunity to have a job interview,

66
00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:09.830
Which is that moment when they receive your CV or your resume

67
00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:16.290
And they think that you might be a good candidate for the job opening or for the job position.

68
00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:19.730
So they call you and say, "We would like to schedule an interview",

69
00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:24.100
Which is when you go and talk to the manager, the boss, Ssomebody at the company

70
00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:28.800
That is basically going to ask you some questions about yourself and your abilities. Right?

71
00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:32.140
So if the company that you have applied for is interested in you,

72
00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:37.510
Then they will call you or email you with what we call "a job offer". Right?

73
00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:41.450
This is when they formally tell you that they'd like you to work for them

74
00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:45.000
And they give you the details about your salary, the schedule,

75
00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:46.760
Your benefits and things like that.

76
00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:52.220
So at this point, you can accept or decline the job offer.

77
00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:56.330
And if you accept the offer, you can tell all your friends and family,

78
00:04:56.890 --> 00:04:59.410
"I got the job. I got the job".

79
00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:03.670
So to get a job basically just means to secure employment.

80
00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:12.240
So to get a job is what I see as informal but very normal and common daily speech. To get a job.

81
00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:17.340
Now, to secure employment means the exact same thing, it just sounds very formal to me.

82
00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:22.790
It would be very, very... I mean, I want to say it would be strange,

83
00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:27.160
It would sound extremely formal, like strangely formal if my friend said,

84
00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:30.200
"Hey man, I secured employment at the company".

85
00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:33.860
It's like, in my experience we just don't speak like that.

86
00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:39.600
We would say "I got a job", which again just means I secured employment. All right? Cool.

87
00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:42.970
So here are some words and phrases we can use to describe your job.

88
00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:46.150
Number one, full-time job.

89
00:05:46.570 --> 00:05:50.550
A full-time job is a job at which you work 40 hours a week, right?

90
00:05:50.810 --> 00:05:55.880
For example, I have a full-time job and I sell clothes on the weekends.

91
00:05:56.600 --> 00:05:58.330
The next one, a part-time job.

92
00:05:59.110 --> 00:06:04.220
A part-time job is a job at which you work, maybe 20 to 25 hours a week.

93
00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:07.680
It's not something that you do for 8 hours a day, 5 days a week.

94
00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:10.250
It's most likely half that time or less.

95
00:06:10.530 --> 00:06:15.340
For example, I'm still studying at university, so I'm just working a part-time job.

96
00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:20.940
So, I have to study most of the time so I don't have enough time to work a full-time job,

97
00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:22.820
So I just work a part-time job.

98
00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:26.770
The next term on the list is a demanding job.

99
00:06:27.250 --> 00:06:31.840
A demanding job is a job that requires a lot of time, energy, and effort.

100
00:06:32.150 --> 00:06:35.830
For example, being a military soldier is a demanding job.

101
00:06:36.250 --> 00:06:40.250
You are constantly in mentally and physically stressful situations.

102
00:06:40.970 --> 00:06:46.350
The next term on the list is a fulfilling job or a rewarding job.

103
00:06:46.390 --> 00:06:51.490
In this case, it's essentially the same thing, a fulfilling job or a rewarding job.

104
00:06:51.820 --> 00:06:54.010
And that just means a job that makes you feel good.

105
00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:56.490
You know, maybe you don't make a lot of money doing it,

106
00:06:56.680 --> 00:06:58.350
And maybe you do, but that's not the point.

107
00:06:58.680 --> 00:07:01.720
It's a job that makes you feel good internally. It makes you happy.

108
00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:07.330
You know, it gives you energy. You wake up in the morning wanting to do that job,

109
00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:11.100
Even if you don't make a lot of money because the other benefits

110
00:07:11.100 --> 00:07:14.600
That you get are so much more important than that, you know?

111
00:07:15.490 --> 00:07:16.610
So here's an example.

112
00:07:17.610 --> 00:07:21.490
Teaching people how to speak English is the most rewarding job I've ever had,

113
00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:26.620
Which is basically saying out of all the jobs I've done over the years,

114
00:07:26.820 --> 00:07:30.410
Teaching people how to speak English is the one that makes me feel the best.

115
00:07:30.710 --> 00:07:33.340
It's the one that makes me feel whole or complete,

116
00:07:33.930 --> 00:07:36.440
More so than any other job I've had before.

117
00:07:37.410 --> 00:07:40.650
All right. Next to him on the list is an entry-level job.

118
00:07:41.190 --> 00:07:45.620
An entry-level job is a job that can be done by someone who is just beginning their career,

119
00:07:46.220 --> 00:07:49.910
And these types of jobs don't really require much experience or skills.

120
00:07:50.180 --> 00:07:55.540
For example, Daniel got an entry-level job as an administrative assistant.

121
00:07:55.840 --> 00:08:01.310
So basically in this context, when I'm saying an entry-level job administrative assistant

122
00:08:01.740 --> 00:08:06.470
Doesn't necessarily require years of study or certifications or,

123
00:08:06.950 --> 00:08:09.920
You know, very difficult skills or anything like that.

124
00:08:10.130 --> 00:08:13.220
Because you're most likely answering emails, filing documents,

125
00:08:13.220 --> 00:08:14.670
Answering phones, and things like that.

126
00:08:14.920 --> 00:08:19.660
It's not exactly skilled work in this case, so that's why it's entry-level.

127
00:08:19.920 --> 00:08:23.170
You're just entering the job market or you're just starting your career.

128
00:08:23.670 --> 00:08:28.120
Over time, you'll gain more skills and experience and get to higher-level jobs. Ok?

129
00:08:28.120 --> 00:08:33.810
All right, next on the list is a dead-end job. Very useful.

130
00:08:34.240 --> 00:08:39.430
A dead-end job is a job that has no opportunities for advancement or promotions, right?

131
00:08:39.670 --> 00:08:43.540
For example, being a truck driver is a dead-end job.

132
00:08:44.700 --> 00:08:46.240
Being a truck driver is a dead-end job.

133
00:08:46.270 --> 00:08:50.460
So what this sentence is saying or what the sentence is expressing is that

134
00:08:50.830 --> 00:08:57.240
Driving a truck for a living or driving a truck as a job doesn't really have much room to grow.

135
00:08:57.270 --> 00:09:02.570
There's no opportunities to advance to a higher position or make more money, learn new skills.

136
00:09:02.570 --> 00:09:06.510
You just kind of do the same thing every day, and that's it.

137
00:09:07.180 --> 00:09:10.960
So there's nowhere to go, and that's why we call it a dead-end job.

138
00:09:10.960 --> 00:09:14.020
Because if you're driving your car down the street

139
00:09:14.410 --> 00:09:17.510
And you get to a point in the street where you cannot go forward anymore.

140
00:09:17.550 --> 00:09:18.380
There's a barrier.

141
00:09:18.810 --> 00:09:22.000
There's something that's stopping you from moving forward or making progress.

142
00:09:22.430 --> 00:09:25.900
That's a dead end. It's the end of the street. It's dead, there's nowhere to go.

143
00:09:25.900 --> 00:09:28.890
So that's where the term "dead-end job" comes from

144
00:09:28.890 --> 00:09:33.620
Because you have nowhere to go in this career. Not forward. Not upwards. Nothing.

145
00:09:33.620 --> 00:09:37.460
It's just you're here. This is... the job is the destination.

146
00:09:37.460 --> 00:09:40.320
You're not going to advance or grow whatsoever.

147
00:09:41.100 --> 00:09:44.140
All right. Next on the list is a high-caliber job.

148
00:09:44.140 --> 00:09:49.020
A high-caliber job is like a dynamic or very important job. Ok?

149
00:09:49.370 --> 00:09:50.210
So here's an example.

150
00:09:51.010 --> 00:09:57.160
After she published her book, she got a high-caliber job as a director of a national newspaper.

151
00:09:57.990 --> 00:10:02.900
So after she wrote and published this book, she found this very important,

152
00:10:02.990 --> 00:10:07.940
Very powerful, high-status position at a national newspaper. You see?

153
00:10:08.600 --> 00:10:11.770
High caliber, high status. Most likely a lot of money.

154
00:10:12.190 --> 00:10:15.070
Very important position. High caliber. All right.

155
00:10:15.070 --> 00:10:17.730
Next on the list is a lucrative job.

156
00:10:18.560 --> 00:10:23.320
A lucrative job, and a lucrative job is just a job where you earn a lot of money.

157
00:10:23.360 --> 00:10:26.610
If something is lucrative, it means that it generates a lot of profit,

158
00:10:26.890 --> 00:10:29.900
A lot of money, a lot of cash, and a lot of dough, a lot of cheese.

159
00:10:30.170 --> 00:10:32.750
You're getting paid a lot. You know what I'm saying?

160
00:10:32.750 --> 00:10:35.960
You're getting paid good. Good money. So here's an example.

161
00:10:36.550 --> 00:10:41.530
My mother wants me to marry a guy with a lucrative job, like a doctor or a lawyer.

162
00:10:42.010 --> 00:10:46.680
So basically, my mom wants me to marry a rich guy, a guy that makes a lot of money,

163
00:10:46.770 --> 00:10:49.760
A guy that does something that pays him well.

164
00:10:50.050 --> 00:10:52.330
That's the idea. A lucrative job.

165
00:10:52.330 --> 00:10:55.550
All right. The next term on the list is day job.

166
00:10:56.650 --> 00:11:03.410
Day job, and a day job is a person's regular job and main source of income or main source of money.

167
00:11:04.020 --> 00:11:09.370
And we typically use this term in situations where we're talking about somebody has a job,

168
00:11:09.930 --> 00:11:13.690
But it's not necessarily their passion if they're using the word "day job",

169
00:11:13.690 --> 00:11:17.710
It's most likely because they do something else that they enjoy much more.

170
00:11:18.130 --> 00:11:22.230
For example, he pays for his independent movies with the money

171
00:11:22.230 --> 00:11:25.560
That he earns at his day job as a store manager.

172
00:11:26.380 --> 00:11:29.520
So during the day Monday to Friday, he works as a store manager

173
00:11:29.520 --> 00:11:35.490
And he takes part of that money to work on his real passion, which is making movies. You see?

174
00:11:35.810 --> 00:11:37.560
So when somebody uses the word day job,

175
00:11:37.820 --> 00:11:41.290
It's most likely because they're just doing that for the money or that's their career,

176
00:11:41.290 --> 00:11:44.940
But they have some other passion that they work on in their free time.

177
00:11:44.940 --> 00:11:49.670
And you might hear it in movies or podcasts or TV series or something like that.

178
00:11:50.310 --> 00:11:54.700
Let's imagine somebody wants to be a musician and they play music for all their friends,

179
00:11:55.010 --> 00:11:59.450
And it's just terrible. They're really, really bad at playing the saxophone, for example.

180
00:11:59.940 --> 00:12:03.260
You know, there's no way they can make a career actually being a musician,

181
00:12:03.360 --> 00:12:07.200
Even if they want to be a professional musician and somebody in the crowd,

182
00:12:07.200 --> 00:12:10.880
One of their friends or family members says, "Don't quit your day job".

183
00:12:12.060 --> 00:12:14.390
Don't quit your day job. So basically what they're saying is

184
00:12:14.500 --> 00:12:19.180
Do not abandon your steady job with a good paycheck, a consistent paycheck,

185
00:12:19.580 --> 00:12:22.650
And try to pursue a career in music.

186
00:12:22.680 --> 00:12:25.240
And we'll talk about the word career in just a second.

187
00:12:25.830 --> 00:12:27.770
So it's kind of like a joke, a cultural joke.

188
00:12:27.770 --> 00:12:32.030
If somebody says, "Don't quit your day job" it means you are not good enough at your passion

189
00:12:32.030 --> 00:12:36.720
And activity to abandon your steady job. You see?

190
00:12:36.720 --> 00:12:38.500
Because your skills just aren't good enough.

191
00:12:38.500 --> 00:12:43.010
So if you quit your job and try to pursue that, you're not going to make any money.

192
00:12:43.010 --> 00:12:45.090
So do not quit your day job, you know?

193
00:12:45.090 --> 00:12:51.400
All right. Now, the last term on the list is odd job. O D D, odd job.

194
00:12:51.870 --> 00:12:55.980
Now, the definition of odd job is a casual or isolated piece of work,

195
00:12:56.350 --> 00:12:59.720
Especially one of a routine domestic or manual nature.

196
00:12:59.720 --> 00:13:02.020
Now, I got that definition from a dictionary,

197
00:13:02.670 --> 00:13:06.830
But it's not the best or the clearest definition.

198
00:13:06.830 --> 00:13:10.450
So an odd job is just something most of the time it's manual labor

199
00:13:10.860 --> 00:13:13.930
And it's something that you do one time in exchange for one payment.

200
00:13:14.210 --> 00:13:19.030
For example, he takes odd jobs here and there, but nothing that would lead to a career.

201
00:13:19.810 --> 00:13:23.760
So let's imagine I want to be a carpenter, I want to build houses.

202
00:13:24.600 --> 00:13:29.590
And every once in a while, a friend or a family member might ask me to build a doghouse

203
00:13:29.910 --> 00:13:34.680
Or a bookshelf or something like that. I do it one time and they pay me one time.

204
00:13:34.680 --> 00:13:39.710
That's an odd job. It's not my occupation. I'm not being paid consistently to do that.

205
00:13:39.980 --> 00:13:44.200
It's not my career or anything like that. It's just I do it every once in a while.

206
00:13:44.490 --> 00:13:49.710
I do a job here, I do a job there. And that's it. Little odd jobs here and there.

207
00:13:50.470 --> 00:13:51.340
Hopefully, that makes sense.

208
00:13:52.190 --> 00:13:56.860
It's also important to remember that the word 'job' is a countable noun.

209
00:13:57.190 --> 00:14:02.560
For example, I work two jobs just to be able to pay my bills and feed my family.

210
00:14:03.570 --> 00:14:08.260
Another example, Jessica has had seven jobs in the past five years.

211
00:14:08.580 --> 00:14:12.490
So in both examples, it's clear that the word 'job' is countable.

212
00:14:12.560 --> 00:14:16.150
Two jobs, five jobs, seven jobs, twenty jobs. Ok?

213
00:14:17.030 --> 00:14:18.640
All right, my friend. That's it for 'job'.

214
00:14:18.640 --> 00:14:21.230
Hopefully, it's clear what it means, how we use it,

215
00:14:21.550 --> 00:14:25.660
And gave you a bunch of phrases to talk about or describe your job.

216
00:14:25.770 --> 00:14:28.060
So now let's talk about work.

217
00:14:28.630 --> 00:14:33.440
Now the word 'work' is both a noun and a verb, and it refers to...

218
00:14:34.660 --> 00:14:37.870
How can I say, the word 'work' is a much more general word.

219
00:14:38.040 --> 00:14:40.810
Job is specific, work is a general. Right?

220
00:14:41.010 --> 00:14:46.160
Work refers to the general efforts and activities done to accomplish a goal. Ok?

221
00:14:46.730 --> 00:14:49.730
So work can be done even if you don't have a job.

222
00:14:50.060 --> 00:14:55.440
For example, studying English is work, but it's not your job. You see?

223
00:14:55.930 --> 00:14:58.700
It's not the activity that you do for 40 hours a week

224
00:14:59.090 --> 00:15:01.740
In exchange for the money you need to pay the bills. Right?

225
00:15:02.100 --> 00:15:05.410
That is your job. But English is just work.

226
00:15:05.410 --> 00:15:09.080
I shouldn't say English. Learning English is just work. It's not your job.

227
00:15:09.540 --> 00:15:12.780
So I could say, if you want to become fluent in English,

228
00:15:12.930 --> 00:15:18.380
You have to put in the work or you have to do the work that's necessary for you to see the results.

229
00:15:18.820 --> 00:15:22.160
You wouldn't say if you want to learn English, you have to do the job.

230
00:15:23.920 --> 00:15:29.410
Although I would probably understand the idea you were trying to express, it sounds very unnatural.

231
00:15:30.260 --> 00:15:33.940
So here are some words and phrases that we can use when talking about work.

232
00:15:34.480 --> 00:15:37.200
The first one, you can say that you work at,

233
00:15:38.020 --> 00:15:40.690
Or you can say that you work for a company.

234
00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:46.290
For example, I work at General Motors. I work at General Motors.

235
00:15:46.600 --> 00:15:50.790
So you're saying that I work at or for the company, General Motors.

236
00:15:51.040 --> 00:15:54.430
That's where I work or that's the company for which I work.

237
00:15:54.860 --> 00:15:57.970
So here's another example. I work for Adidas.

238
00:15:58.570 --> 00:15:59.760
Now, I could switch these two,

239
00:16:00.070 --> 00:16:02.660
I could switch those prepositions and they would have the same meaning.

240
00:16:02.770 --> 00:16:06.830
I could say I work for General Motors or I work at General Motors.

241
00:16:07.610 --> 00:16:08.700
No difference whatsoever.

242
00:16:09.120 --> 00:16:13.050
I work for Adidas or I work at Adidas. Same thing to me.

243
00:16:13.690 --> 00:16:18.250
Whichever one is easier for you to remember or use, use that one. All right?

244
00:16:18.600 --> 00:16:24.070
The next one, you can say you're working on a project or a task.

245
00:16:24.300 --> 00:16:25.360
So let me give you an example.

246
00:16:26.290 --> 00:16:28.920
I'm working on an important financial report.

247
00:16:29.820 --> 00:16:34.610
So the current task that has my attention is this financial report.

248
00:16:34.610 --> 00:16:35.990
That's what I'm working on.

249
00:16:36.390 --> 00:16:38.590
You wouldn't say, "I'm working at financial report".

250
00:16:39.200 --> 00:16:41.880
Now, there might be some exceptions where somebody says something like that.

251
00:16:42.270 --> 00:16:44.750
But I don't want to confuse you,

252
00:16:44.750 --> 00:16:47.590
And it's not something that you need to think so much about.

253
00:16:47.590 --> 00:16:51.530
So just remember, we work on things. I'm working on this report.

254
00:16:51.830 --> 00:16:54.510
I'm working on this new course. I'm working on my car.

255
00:16:54.860 --> 00:16:59.420
I'm working on something, a task or a project or something like that.

256
00:16:59.420 --> 00:17:02.780
We work on tasks. We work on projects. All right?

257
00:17:03.190 --> 00:17:07.350
Here's another example. I'm working on improving customer satisfaction.

258
00:17:08.090 --> 00:17:11.060
So my current task, my current responsibility or project,

259
00:17:11.060 --> 00:17:14.940
This goal I'm trying to achieve is improving customer satisfaction.

260
00:17:15.020 --> 00:17:17.360
That is what I'm working on. All right?

261
00:17:18.030 --> 00:17:22.500
The next one, you can say that you work with particular people

262
00:17:22.800 --> 00:17:24.790
Or objects or I guess animals, right?

263
00:17:24.790 --> 00:17:28.920
For example, I work with pre-intermediate learners of English,

264
00:17:29.750 --> 00:17:33.820
So we're talking about people here. These are the people that I work with.

265
00:17:33.860 --> 00:17:36.380
I don't work on people. Although you could say that,

266
00:17:36.380 --> 00:17:39.300
It means something different and I don't want to confuse you.

267
00:17:39.630 --> 00:17:42.160
So we work with people or we work with things.

268
00:17:42.390 --> 00:17:46.070
So again, I work with pre-intermediate learners of English.

269
00:17:46.610 --> 00:17:51.320
Here's another example. I work with children ages 5 to 7.

270
00:17:51.820 --> 00:17:54.290
So maybe I'm a school teacher, an elementary school teacher,

271
00:17:54.610 --> 00:17:58.190
And I work with young kids ages 5 to 7.

272
00:17:58.240 --> 00:18:02.840
I don't work with teenagers, I don't work with dogs, I don't work with senior citizens.

273
00:18:02.930 --> 00:18:05.920
I work with children ages 5 to 7. All right?

274
00:18:06.160 --> 00:18:10.640
But you could also say, I work with hazardous chemicals, you know.

275
00:18:10.710 --> 00:18:16.340
I work with special needs children. Stuff like that. Ok? All right.

276
00:18:16.340 --> 00:18:21.180
So the word 'work' also refers to the context of your place of employment.

277
00:18:21.540 --> 00:18:29.710
For example, I start work at 7 a.m. I wouldn't say "I start my job at 7 a.m".

278
00:18:29.760 --> 00:18:32.400
You could but it just doesn't sound natural.

279
00:18:32.460 --> 00:18:35.350
It's much more natural to say, I start work at 7 a.m.

280
00:18:35.730 --> 00:18:39.570
And that can mean that you arrive at work at 7 a.m

281
00:18:39.880 --> 00:18:44.450
Or you start doing your job or working at 7 a.m.

282
00:18:44.560 --> 00:18:46.650
Hopefully, I'm not confusing you here. All right?

283
00:18:47.320 --> 00:18:52.510
So another example I finish or I leave work at 4:30 p.m.

284
00:18:53.570 --> 00:18:57.550
I wouldn't say "I finished my job at 4:30 pm every day".

285
00:18:58.830 --> 00:19:02.370
Just doesn't sound natural. That's not the way we use that word.

286
00:19:02.910 --> 00:19:08.040
So, just so you know, in that example, I said "I leave work or I finish work at 4:30".

287
00:19:08.620 --> 00:19:13.170
I think a much more common but also informal way to say that is.

288
00:19:13.350 --> 00:19:16.040
"I get off work at 4:30 p.m".

289
00:19:16.680 --> 00:19:19.790
So to get off work just means to finish working or to leave work.

290
00:19:20.140 --> 00:19:24.550
I get off at 4:30. It's much more common, at least here in the United States.

291
00:19:24.830 --> 00:19:27.920
They'll say, What time do you work today?

292
00:19:28.400 --> 00:19:31.460
I start work at 7:30 in the morning.

293
00:19:31.790 --> 00:19:33.520
Oh, cool. What time do you get off?

294
00:19:34.670 --> 00:19:36.940
Which is the same thing as asking, what time do you finish,

295
00:19:36.940 --> 00:19:38.250
What time are you going to leave?

296
00:19:39.380 --> 00:19:43.240
I get off at 4:30. Ok? Cool.

297
00:19:43.380 --> 00:19:46.920
So another one, we go to work by car.

298
00:19:48.200 --> 00:19:51.770
I wouldn't say we go to our job or I go to my job by car.

299
00:19:51.870 --> 00:19:55.680
You could and it would make sense. It would be understandable. So don't worry about that.

300
00:19:56.170 --> 00:19:59.560
But just the most natural way to say that is "I go to work", right?

301
00:19:59.560 --> 00:20:04.650
The place where I work is also my work. I know that sounds funny, it's kind of strange.

302
00:20:04.650 --> 00:20:08.790
It's hard to explain. But the word 'work' refers to the effort that you make,

303
00:20:08.820 --> 00:20:12.480
But also the place where you make that effort. Right?

304
00:20:12.480 --> 00:20:15.650
The office, the store, whatever it is, that's also work.

305
00:20:16.130 --> 00:20:21.640
It's the location and the effort as confusing as that might be. All right? Cool.

306
00:20:24.020 --> 00:20:28.380
So last example, I can't access Facebook when I'm at work.

307
00:20:29.840 --> 00:20:33.770
You could say, I can't access Facebook when I'm at my job.

308
00:20:33.880 --> 00:20:37.010
But it's much more natural, much more common to say,

309
00:20:37.090 --> 00:20:39.770
I can't access Facebook when I'm at work.

310
00:20:40.160 --> 00:20:45.230
When I'm at this location doing my job I can't be on Facebook. You see?

311
00:20:46.110 --> 00:20:50.220
So the idea to remember is that the word 'work' is a very general word

312
00:20:50.220 --> 00:20:53.620
That refers to your effort and the place where you make that effort.

313
00:20:54.170 --> 00:20:57.410
Now, you will hear some people use the word 'job' in the same way.

314
00:20:57.490 --> 00:21:01.440
Like I said, for example, I was talking to this guy at my job.

315
00:21:02.130 --> 00:21:06.100
Now, although it makes sense when we hear it, it's technically incorrect.

316
00:21:06.470 --> 00:21:11.340
If you answered that question like on an English exam or something like that

317
00:21:11.340 --> 00:21:15.640
And you chose the word job instead of work, you would probably get that question wrong.

318
00:21:16.330 --> 00:21:18.700
If you said, I was talking to this guy at my job.

319
00:21:19.180 --> 00:21:22.800
They would be expecting you to say, I was talking to this guy at work.

320
00:21:23.630 --> 00:21:27.570
One last detail about work. Work is an uncountable noun,

321
00:21:27.700 --> 00:21:29.720
So we do not use it in the plural form.

322
00:21:30.030 --> 00:21:32.830
Now, there are some exceptions and I'll talk about that in just a second.

323
00:21:32.880 --> 00:21:36.970
But let me give you an example. I have three works to do this week.

324
00:21:38.810 --> 00:21:42.440
It's incorrect. We wouldn't say "I have three works to do this week".

325
00:21:42.800 --> 00:21:46.420
Because really what you're trying to say is you have three projects to do this week

326
00:21:46.760 --> 00:21:51.530
Or you have three things or three tasks or three assignments to do this week.

327
00:21:51.710 --> 00:21:54.720
Individual things that you need to get done because you're accounting them.

328
00:21:55.030 --> 00:21:57.370
There's three things. But you cannot count work.

329
00:21:58.030 --> 00:22:02.170
So if you really want to say, for example, I have three works to do this week.

330
00:22:02.610 --> 00:22:05.850
You could say "I have a lot of work to do this week"

331
00:22:05.870 --> 00:22:09.310
Because in that case you're not counting the work. It's just a lot of it.

332
00:22:09.510 --> 00:22:12.140
We don't know how much because we can't count them or it.

333
00:22:12.490 --> 00:22:14.120
We can't count work, right?

334
00:22:14.240 --> 00:22:16.780
So you can say, I have a lot of work to do this week

335
00:22:17.140 --> 00:22:22.760
Or I have 10 things to do this week. 50 projects. 100 tasks. Ok?

336
00:22:23.680 --> 00:22:25.420
Now, the exception, like I said,

337
00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:29.950
The only exception that I could think of is sometimes when we're talking about artwork

338
00:22:30.460 --> 00:22:37.810
Or literary work, we'll use the word "works" in the plural form talking about individual pieces of art.

339
00:22:38.170 --> 00:22:40.660
Like the works of Pablo Picasso or something like that.

340
00:22:40.980 --> 00:22:44.170
We're talking about all of his paintings, all of his artistic projects.

341
00:22:44.570 --> 00:22:46.640
Why we do that? I have no idea.

342
00:22:46.910 --> 00:22:48.630
But that's the only exception I could think of.

343
00:22:48.630 --> 00:22:53.630
So in every other case, just remember, work is uncountable. All right?

344
00:22:54.530 --> 00:23:01.970
Now, last but not least. Career. The word 'career' is a noun. We do not use it as a verb.

345
00:23:02.490 --> 00:23:07.320
And your career describes the total progression of your professional life.

346
00:23:08.100 --> 00:23:11.330
It can include many different jobs over many years.

347
00:23:12.010 --> 00:23:16.360
So you can have a career in a particular field or a particular industry.

348
00:23:16.630 --> 00:23:22.400
For example, I can have a career in education, or I can have a career in politics

349
00:23:22.460 --> 00:23:27.620
Or journalism or finance or software engineering. You see?

350
00:23:27.640 --> 00:23:33.240
Or technology, let's say. So let's imagine that I had a twenty-year career in education.

351
00:23:33.620 --> 00:23:37.480
That means that I worked in that particular industry for 20 years,

352
00:23:37.900 --> 00:23:41.980
But I could have had multiple jobs or positions or occupations.

353
00:23:42.530 --> 00:23:47.050
I could have been a teacher, then a school principal, and then a consultant.

354
00:23:47.420 --> 00:23:52.560
Now all of these are jobs that I've done during my career in education,

355
00:23:52.930 --> 00:23:57.960
And all of that was very rewarding work. You see what I did there?

356
00:23:59.290 --> 00:24:01.580
All right. So here are some common phrases

357
00:24:01.580 --> 00:24:04.560
And words and things like that that we can use with 'career'.

358
00:24:05.120 --> 00:24:11.930
The first one, to embark on a career. Embark. E M B A R K, embark.

359
00:24:12.230 --> 00:24:15.150
All that means is to begin or to start a career.

360
00:24:15.670 --> 00:24:18.140
Now, this in my opinion, is a very formal thing to say.

361
00:24:18.400 --> 00:24:22.840
To embark on a career. It's quite formal, just so you know.

362
00:24:22.890 --> 00:24:25.210
You could just say "I'm going to start a career"

363
00:24:25.320 --> 00:24:27.500
Or "he's at the beginning of his career".

364
00:24:27.770 --> 00:24:31.560
To say he's embarking on this new career, there's nothing wrong with it.

365
00:24:31.980 --> 00:24:33.460
It's just formal, in my opinion.

366
00:24:33.810 --> 00:24:37.420
So I could say "he's embarking on a new career as a writer",

367
00:24:38.230 --> 00:24:41.350
Which again, just means he's starting his career as a writer.

368
00:24:42.450 --> 00:24:47.070
Now the next phrase, let's say, is to pursue a career.

369
00:24:47.690 --> 00:24:52.520
To pursue a career just means to make an effort to have a career in a particular industry.

370
00:24:52.810 --> 00:24:56.360
So I could say "she wants to pursue an acting career".

371
00:24:57.260 --> 00:24:59.150
And that would be the same thing, just so you know,

372
00:24:59.550 --> 00:25:03.310
I could also say "she wants to pursue a career in acting".

373
00:25:03.840 --> 00:25:05.050
So that's two sentence structures.

374
00:25:05.290 --> 00:25:08.720
The first one, she wants to pursue an acting career.

375
00:25:09.590 --> 00:25:13.530
The second one, she wants to pursue a career in acting.

376
00:25:14.110 --> 00:25:17.990
So you can say a technology career or a career in technology.

377
00:25:18.750 --> 00:25:22.870
An athletic career or a career in athletics or sports. Ok?

378
00:25:24.250 --> 00:25:26.980
All right. Next on the list is a promising career.

379
00:25:27.430 --> 00:25:32.210
A promising career is just a career with good future potential. All right?

380
00:25:32.210 --> 00:25:35.680
A lot of promise. It's another way of saying a lot of potential.

381
00:25:36.010 --> 00:25:40.730
For example, software development is looking like a promising career at the moment.

382
00:25:41.380 --> 00:25:44.870
And that would be the same thing as saying a career in software development

383
00:25:44.870 --> 00:25:48.160
Seems to have a lot of potential at the moment.

384
00:25:48.670 --> 00:25:50.690
It's very promising. There's lots of potential.

385
00:25:52.220 --> 00:25:55.470
All right. Next on the list is switch your career.

386
00:25:55.720 --> 00:26:01.270
S W I T C H, switch or change. Ok? That's really what it means,

387
00:26:01.270 --> 00:26:04.090
To switch careers just means to change careers.

388
00:26:04.380 --> 00:26:11.660
For example, the idea of switching careers at 45 years old seems really scary to me. Right?

389
00:26:11.660 --> 00:26:17.250
Maybe I feel like I'm too old to start a new career, to embark on a new career. Right?

390
00:26:17.970 --> 00:26:21.810
And I just think the idea of switching, the idea of changing is very scary.

391
00:26:23.160 --> 00:26:27.250
Here's another example. Is it too late to switch my career?

392
00:26:28.710 --> 00:26:31.810
Is it too late to change my career? It's the exact same thing.

393
00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:35.900
Is it too late to switch, too late to change? Same thing.

394
00:26:36.470 --> 00:26:39.260
All right. Next on the list, career takes off.

395
00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:43.220
And this is when someone's career starts to become very, very successful.

396
00:26:43.220 --> 00:26:47.360
If your career takes off it means that you start to become very successful

397
00:26:47.360 --> 00:26:49.880
And most likely very rapidly, very fast.

398
00:26:50.220 --> 00:26:55.850
For example, Cristiano Ronaldo's career took off when he joined Manchester United.

399
00:26:56.250 --> 00:27:00.340
So at the moment he joined this new club his career took off.

400
00:27:00.380 --> 00:27:03.260
He became very successful very fast, very famous.

401
00:27:03.520 --> 00:27:07.310
His skill level went to, you know, new heights. Let's say it that way.

402
00:27:07.340 --> 00:27:10.480
Just took off like a rocket ship or like an airplane, something like that.

403
00:27:11.190 --> 00:27:12.000
Here's another example.

404
00:27:12.640 --> 00:27:16.530
Her music career took off after she released her second album.

405
00:27:17.370 --> 00:27:20.320
So her first album, people knew about her. Things were ok.

406
00:27:20.320 --> 00:27:24.330
But when she released that second album, her career exploded.

407
00:27:24.460 --> 00:27:28.180
And that's another way you can say it. Her career exploded. It took off.

408
00:27:28.460 --> 00:27:31.120
Things started to go very, very well for her. Ok?

409
00:27:31.120 --> 00:27:38.910
All right. Next on the list is at the height or at the peak of your career,

410
00:27:39.560 --> 00:27:43.210
And this just means at the most successful point in your career.

411
00:27:43.450 --> 00:27:44.220
So here's an example.

412
00:27:45.690 --> 00:27:48.940
At the height of his career, nobody could play better than him.

413
00:27:50.330 --> 00:27:54.720
So let's think about... You know I love soccer, so I'll use another soccer example.

414
00:27:55.170 --> 00:27:57.510
Ronaldinho, at the height of his career,

415
00:27:57.680 --> 00:28:01.790
At the most successful point in his career when he was playing his best football,

416
00:28:02.270 --> 00:28:05.990
Nobody could play better than he could play. Right?

417
00:28:06.810 --> 00:28:11.000
Here's another example. We lost it all at the peak of our career.

418
00:28:12.330 --> 00:28:14.170
We lost it all at the peak of our career,

419
00:28:14.170 --> 00:28:17.900
Which means at the highest point, the most success we had ever had,

420
00:28:18.360 --> 00:28:22.970
The best moment in our career we lost everything. Lost it all. Ok?

421
00:28:23.910 --> 00:28:28.780
Last one, ruin your career. R U I N.

422
00:28:29.100 --> 00:28:32.500
This just means to destroy your career. That's really what it means.

423
00:28:32.500 --> 00:28:36.550
So here's an example. That was the move that ruined his career.

424
00:28:37.820 --> 00:28:43.530
That was the decision, that was the action or whatever that destroyed his career.

425
00:28:43.850 --> 00:28:46.150
It ruined his career. Ok?

426
00:28:47.030 --> 00:28:47.820
Here's another example.

427
00:28:48.790 --> 00:28:52.330
She allowed her social media presence to ruin her career.

428
00:28:53.580 --> 00:28:57.160
So she's doing crazy things online, and you know, once you put it online,

429
00:28:57.660 --> 00:28:59.780
You can't really take it away, it's there forever.

430
00:29:00.120 --> 00:29:05.220
So somebody saw this video or that tweet or that post or whatever it was

431
00:29:05.650 --> 00:29:08.920
And it ruined her reputation. Maybe she lost her job or whatever.

432
00:29:08.920 --> 00:29:12.930
It just destroyed her professional career. That's the idea.

433
00:29:13.850 --> 00:29:18.410
Now it's also important to note that we don't use this word when referring to your studies.

434
00:29:18.890 --> 00:29:21.420
In other languages it's very common to use the word 'career'

435
00:29:21.710 --> 00:29:23.990
To talk about what you're studying at university.

436
00:29:24.310 --> 00:29:27.960
For example, I have or I did a career in medicine.

437
00:29:29.290 --> 00:29:32.530
This doesn't imply that you're referring to your studies at university,

438
00:29:32.840 --> 00:29:37.800
It implies that medicine is the industry in which you worked for an extended period of time. Right?

439
00:29:38.140 --> 00:29:42.730
However, you can say "my academic career" if you're referring to Y

440
00:29:42.730 --> 00:29:46.680
Your overall performance in an academic setting over time.

441
00:29:47.150 --> 00:29:49.220
Hopefully, that's not confusing to you.

442
00:29:49.730 --> 00:29:54.630
So here's an example. That was the hardest exam of my academic career.

443
00:29:54.630 --> 00:29:58.290
That was the hardest exam of my academic career.

444
00:29:58.290 --> 00:30:01.660
My entire academic career, that was the hardest one.

445
00:30:02.050 --> 00:30:06.050
So maybe after eight years of studying to become a psychologist,

446
00:30:06.710 --> 00:30:09.020
You're essentially a professional student at that point.

447
00:30:09.020 --> 00:30:11.710
You've done nothing but study for the past eight years.

448
00:30:11.710 --> 00:30:15.020
You have made a career in academics, essentially.

449
00:30:15.590 --> 00:30:20.870
And that particular test was the hardest one of your eight-year academic career.

450
00:30:21.570 --> 00:30:22.550
Hopefully, that makes sense.

451
00:30:23.420 --> 00:30:26.330
All right, my friend. I know there was a lot of information,

452
00:30:26.330 --> 00:30:30.560
But hopefully, the differences between job, work, and career are clear to you now.

453
00:30:31.020 --> 00:30:36.160
You should also have a bunch of words and phrases to talk about your job, your work, and your career.

454
00:30:36.510 --> 00:30:38.330
But as always, if you have any questions,

455
00:30:38.330 --> 00:30:40.570
Leave them in the comment section or shoot me a message

456
00:30:40.910 --> 00:30:43.170
And I'll get back to you as soon as I get the chance. All right?

457
00:30:43.450 --> 00:30:46.390
That's Coffee with Kaizen number 16 in the books.

458
00:30:46.960 --> 00:30:48.820
So I'll talk to you later. Peace!

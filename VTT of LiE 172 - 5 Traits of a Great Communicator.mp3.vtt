00:00:00.940 --> 00:00:08.330
The first thing that all great communicators possess is a
childlike curiosity. The dictionary defines "curiosity" as a

2
00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:15.400
strong desire to know or learn something. Have you got kids
or younger siblings? Then you know how curious kids can be.

3
00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:23.640
They want to know how things work, where things come from,
and why we do the things we do. They ask us deep questions.

4
00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:29.870
They catch us off guard and make us consider things we had
never thought about before. Kids ask us so many questions

5
00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:36.410
that we end up getting annoyed, partly because no one likes
answering countless questions but I suspect that it's also

6
00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:43.290
because we don't have the answers to half the questions they
ask us and it makes us feel ignorant. Now, you might forget

7
00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:51.490
this from time to time, but you were once a kid. You most
likely had the same level of curiosity. Everything was

8
00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:58.100
interesting and you wanted to know more about the world and
how it worked. But somewhere along the line, you, like most

9
00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:05.010
of us, lost that childlike curiosity. There could be many
reasons for this, but that's beside my point. In my

10
00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:11.970
experience, most people will struggle to have good
conversations because they're not curious at all. Most

11
00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:17.330
people have no desire to learn new things, and most of the
time it's because they think they know everything already.

12
00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:23.400
So instead of listening with the intention of learning
something, they listen only with the intention of responding

13
00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:31.100
to what's being said. I really need you to understand the
difference between those two things. The arrogant,

14
00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:38.200
uninterested individual who lacks curiosity, doesn't want to
hear people out and understand where they're coming from but

15
00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:44.960
instead he cuts them off as soon as he hears something he
disagrees with. Whenever someone says something he dislikes

16
00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:51.410
or disagrees with, he immediately labels them as stupid. And
you can't learn anything from stupid people therefore,

17
00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:58.810
there's no reason to listen to him. So he just strokes his
own ego by going on and on about what he thinks he knows.

18
00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:07.120
This is not listening. Imagine calling your girlfriend and
telling her that you want to have sex. So you invite her to

19
00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:13.560
your house, you get her out of clothes, you get in bed but
then you tell her to just sit there and watch you

20
00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:20.580
masturbate. She's not allowed to participate. She's not
allowed to give instructions. She just has to sit there and

21
00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:29.440
watch you stroke yourself. That's what it's like when you
tell someone you want to have a conversation, but then you

22
00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:37.210
just go on and on and fucking on about what you think. You
know, never giving them a chance to be heard or understood.

23
00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:44.770
But a great communicator understands that everyone has
something to teach him. Great communicators want to know how

24
00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:53.480
things work, where things come from, and why we do the
things we do. Just like children. They do not take things at

25
00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:59.790
face value. They're always trying to dig deeper, to
understand people better, to gain better insights into human

26
00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:08.070
behavior. They know there's a difference between what people
say and what people mean. And it's curiosity that compels

27
00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:14.370
them to go beyond the vague things people say in order to
get to the deeper message that's being communicated. Now,

28
00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:19.050
I'll give you an example of that in just a moment. But
first, let me tell you about the second thing that all great

29
00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:22.610
communicators have. Listening skills.

30
00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:30.260
Listening skills are the most valuable asset any
communicator can have. It's also the most overlooked, which

31
00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:36.650
is why most people never invest in them. A lot of English
learners will say they need to improve their listening when

32
00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:43.980
they really just want to improve their comprehension. Now,
I'm not a linguist, but in my mind, comprehension refers to

33
00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:51.630
one's ability to understand the meaning of the words being
said. For example, when I say the word "dog", you can

34
00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:58.700
probably envision a furry four-legged animal that goes
"woof, woof", right? But if I say, "You're a fucking dog!"

35
00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:06.750
You can comprehend those words, but you're a human, so why
would I be calling you a "dog"? You would need to use the

36
00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:13.970
context of the situation to understand that I'm basically
calling you a despicable human being. So while comprehension

37
00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:21.540
refers to being able to recognize words being said,
listening refers to one's ability to understand the message

38
00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:28.880
being communicated by the words being said. As I said
before, great communicators understand that the things

39
00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:37.200
people say are often different from the things they mean to
say. If you can internalize this idea and complement it with

40
00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:44.180
your childlike curiosity, I guarantee you, you will come to
understand people much better. Now, let me give you an

41
00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:50.810
example of what I'm talking about. Imagine your dad comes
home from work and you ask him how his day was. He responds

42
00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:56.760
by telling you it was a rough day and he's tired of dealing
with all the bullshit that comes with his job. So you might

43
00:04:56.760 --> 00:05:02.940
say something like, "Damn, that's too bad. I'm sure it'll
get better soon." Or if you're like some people, you might

44
00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:08.900
not engage with them at all because you don't really care
how his day was. You were just asking to be polite. But

45
00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:17.700
let's stop and think about what your dad actually said. "It
was a rough day." Most of us can comprehend the meaning of

46
00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:24.260
this phrase, right? It's just like saying, "It was a
difficult day. It was a challenging day." But what exactly

47
00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:26.350
does he mean by that?

48
00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:32.640
The words "difficult" and "rough" could mean different
things to different people, and things your dad finds

49
00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:39.840
difficult might be extremely easy for you. So you could
deploy some childlike curiosity to go deeper into what he

50
00:05:40.130 --> 00:05:43.730
meant by that. Why was it rough?

51
00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:52.220
What happened exactly? What exactly caused the difficulties
you face today? Have you thought about how to overcome these

52
00:05:52.220 --> 00:06:01.460
difficulties? Are you doing anything to make your life
harder? You have no idea how far a conversation could go by

53
00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:08.650
asking simple questions like these when people say vague
things like, "I had a rough day." And what else did your dad

54
00:06:08.650 --> 00:06:16.820
say? He's tired of dealing with all the bullshit that comes
with his job. But what does that mean? What is it that he

55
00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:25.220
considers "bullshit"? Has he just lost passion for his work?
Is he being dramatic? Does he need to change jobs or does he

56
00:06:25.220 --> 00:06:31.980
just need a vacation? Simply listening attentively with the
intention of understanding what someone is trying to

57
00:06:31.980 --> 00:06:38.730
communicate is how we can make even the most mundane
conversations much more interesting. And deploying some

58
00:06:38.730 --> 00:06:44.670
childlike curiosity almost always gives our conversation
partner the freedom to express themselves in more detail

59
00:06:45.410 --> 00:06:51.650
which gives you the chance to understand them better. The
more you understand someone, the easier it is to talk to

60
00:06:51.650 --> 00:06:58.000
them. And the more someone feels that you understand them,
the more they want to talk to you.

61
00:07:03.220 --> 00:07:09.790
Another thing that all great communicators have is an
extensive vocabulary. As a great communicator, it's

62
00:07:09.790 --> 00:07:14.670
imperative that you know how to say the same thing in many
different ways, depending on the context of the situation.

63
00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:23.260
There are times when you need to be direct. There are times
when you need to be polite and formal. There are times when

64
00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:29.870
you need to say things without saying them, if you know what
I mean. You can navigate the various situations we find

65
00:07:29.870 --> 00:07:37.090
ourselves in by having an extensive vocabulary. For example,
if my wife and I are in the living room with our kids, I

66
00:07:37.090 --> 00:07:43.360
might tell her that "I'm looking forward to the rodeo later
this evening", and my wife would understand that I'm not

67
00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:50.000
talking about cowboys riding horses. I'm talking about
having sex. But I would simply refer to it as a "rodeo"

68
00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:56.380
because our children don't need to hear about the crazy
positions Imma put her in when we have sex tonight. Or maybe

69
00:07:56.530 --> 00:08:02.870
you're speaking with a coworker who just refuses to let you
finish any of your sentences. Every time you speak, they cut

70
00:08:02.870 --> 00:08:10.110
you off to tell you what they think. You could say, "Yo,
stop interrupting me. That shit is rude." Or you could say,

71
00:08:10.110 --> 00:08:16.670
"Listen, if you're not going to listen to me, then we just
won't speak." But phrases like these usually just make the

72
00:08:16.670 --> 00:08:23.710
situation worse. So instead you might say, "Hey, I'm more
than happy to listen to you, but only when that courtesy is

73
00:08:23.710 --> 00:08:30.500
reciprocated." Or maybe you could say, "I would appreciate
it if you let me finish and then I'll hear what you have to

74
00:08:30.500 --> 00:08:38.650
say." Or maybe you could say, "Hey, I can't hear you when
you interrupt me like that. If you wait until I finish

75
00:08:38.650 --> 00:08:48.370
speaking, I'll hear you much better." Words are nothing more
than tools we use to communicate. And tools can be

76
00:08:48.370 --> 00:08:53.270
used to build, destroy, attack, and or defend.

77
00:08:54.490 --> 00:09:01.320
It all depends on the intention and skill level of the
person using the tool. And the more tools you have, the more

78
00:09:01.320 --> 00:09:10.370
things you can build, destroy, attack, and or defend. 
There's an old saying that goes, "If the only tool you have

79
00:09:10.370 --> 00:09:19.520
is a hammer, you tend to see every problem as a nail."
Another way of saying that is with limited tools,

80
00:09:20.020 --> 00:09:28.730
single-minded people use them inappropriately or
indiscriminately. If you're trying to build a house and all

81
00:09:28.730 --> 00:09:37.330
you have is a hammer, life is going to be very hard for you.
You cannot cut wood with a hammer. You cannot connect pipes

82
00:09:37.360 --> 00:09:45.090
or wires with a hammer. You cannot paint the walls with a
hammer. You would need a saw, some wrenches and paint

83
00:09:45.090 --> 00:09:53.780
brushes for those tasks. The only things you can do with the
hammer are insert and remove nails or destroy some shit. Now

84
00:09:53.780 --> 00:09:58.210
think about that in the context of communicating with
people, especially people who don't share your culture or

85
00:09:58.210 --> 00:10:06.840
even your native language. If you can only say things in one
way, you're limiting your ability to build, destroy, attack,

86
00:10:06.910 --> 00:10:15.120
and or defend. You're limiting your ability to connect with
other people. And so the obvious question is "How do I

87
00:10:15.120 --> 00:10:22.410
increase my vocabulary and learn to say things in different
ways?" By communicating with and getting feedback from real

88
00:10:22.410 --> 00:10:29.480
people. By reading books and articles about a variety of
topics. By listening attentively to the words other people

89
00:10:29.480 --> 00:10:37.810
choose when expressing themselves. By understanding the
difference between what we say and how we say it. By

90
00:10:37.810 --> 00:10:43.010
studying different communication styles, by understanding
how our cultural backgrounds influence the way we

91
00:10:43.010 --> 00:10:49.550
communicate. If you want to learn new words, then expose
yourself to new words.

92
00:10:50.640 --> 00:10:56.470
If you want to learn how to use those words effectively,
then use them with real people constantly and monitor the

93
00:10:56.470 --> 00:11:06.330
outcomes of your interactions. Another thing that all great
communicators have is the ability to

94
00:11:06.330 --> 00:11:07.760
simplify ideas.

95
00:11:09.460 --> 00:11:15.350
While every great communicator has an extensive vocabulary
to express their ideas clearly and in detail, they also have

96
00:11:15.350 --> 00:11:22.270
the ability to take complex thoughts and ideas and boil them
down to simple, digestible bits of information that a child

97
00:11:22.270 --> 00:11:29.630
can understand. If you speak in advanced technical terms
that the average person can't comprehend, you're essentially

98
00:11:29.630 --> 00:11:37.380
just talking to yourself. You should speak with the
intention of being understood, not just being heard. And if

99
00:11:37.380 --> 00:11:44.800
you want to be both heard and understood, you need to speak
in terms that your listener will understand. Great

100
00:11:44.800 --> 00:11:50.550
communicators take note of who their audience is, and then
they tailor their word choice and communication style to

101
00:11:50.550 --> 00:11:58.670
that audience. And one simple, yet effective way to do this
is by using analogies. For example, people always ask me,

102
00:11:58.670 --> 00:12:05.290
"What's the best way to learn a language?" Instead of going
into detail on every little thing one could do to become

103
00:12:05.290 --> 00:12:13.740
proficient in the language -- which would be a waste of time
-- I could simplify my ideas with an analogy. "How does one

104
00:12:13.740 --> 00:12:20.330
learn to speak a language?" I would answer that question
with the question, "How does one learn to play soccer?" And

105
00:12:22.270 --> 00:12:26.650
for a lot of people, this answer would be enough to
understand the message without me needing to say anything

106
00:12:26.650 --> 00:12:32.680
else. And for those who still couldn't understand, I could
continue to show the parallels between learning a language

107
00:12:33.090 --> 00:12:40.670
and learning a sport. You take the ball. Go to the field.
Have someone explain the basic rules and you start playing,

108
00:12:41.360 --> 00:12:46.780
right? As you play with people, you will start to get
feedback. You will realize what you're good at and what you

109
00:12:46.780 --> 00:12:52.340
need to work on. You could hire a trainer to help you
improve specific skills. You can watch some YouTube videos

110
00:12:52.340 --> 00:12:58.290
explaining how to do particular tricks during the game. You
could study professional players and try to emulate their

111
00:12:58.290 --> 00:13:05.690
styles. You could do a million things, but at the end of the
day, you simply need to take the ball to the field and start

112
00:13:05.690 --> 00:13:13.130
kicking it. If you play in real games with real people every
day, you will naturally improve, especially when the people

113
00:13:13.130 --> 00:13:20.110
you're playing with have a higher skill level than you. And
if you go weeks or months or years without playing the

114
00:13:20.110 --> 00:13:28.030
sport, you will feel rusty the next time you try to play the
sport. I'm sure all of this sounds obvious to you because

115
00:13:28.030 --> 00:13:36.460
this is a universal truth that we all understand but tend to
forget. There's so much more, I could say, with my extensive

116
00:13:36.460 --> 00:13:42.600
vocabulary and knowledge, but there's no need for that. Most
people don't think as deeply about language learning as I

117
00:13:42.600 --> 00:13:48.060
do, so it wouldn't make any sense for me to go super deep
into the topic if a stranger just asked me a surface level

118
00:13:48.060 --> 00:13:55.740
question. I really hope that makes sense. If you want to
learn how to simplify your ideas and speak in terms that

119
00:13:55.740 --> 00:14:03.510
anyone will understand, you must practice. This is why
writing is so beneficial. You can take the time to put all

120
00:14:03.510 --> 00:14:10.430
your thoughts on paper and analyze your word choice and
communication style. Then you can work to think of simpler,

121
00:14:10.830 --> 00:14:16.480
more digestible ways to say the same things. You can
practice taking your ideas and trying to explain them with

122
00:14:16.480 --> 00:14:23.360
simple analogies. You can and should also continuously
educate yourself by reading, gaining experience, and

123
00:14:23.360 --> 00:14:29.440
learning from other people. Because you'll find that it's
much easier to simplify your ideas with words when you

124
00:14:29.490 --> 00:14:36.570
actually know what you're talking about. And the best part
about writing is that it's totally free and you can take as

125
00:14:36.570 --> 00:14:45.590
much time as you'd like to do it. The problem is that it's
just as easy not to do it as it is to do it, which is why

126
00:14:45.590 --> 00:14:53.920
most people don't do it. It takes real time and effort to
develop and refine your communication skills. But trust me

127
00:14:53.920 --> 00:15:00.550
when I tell you it's an investment which will pay huge
dividends no matter what you want to do in this life.

128
00:15:04.780 --> 00:15:10.940
Now, another thing that all great communicators have is a
wide range of knowledge. Now, you don't need to know

129
00:15:10.990 --> 00:15:15.950
everything under the sun to have great conversations with
people, but you do need to be able to talk about something

130
00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:23.070
other than your personal interests. And if you have no
personal interest, that's fine too. I've got good news for

131
00:15:23.070 --> 00:15:29.640
you: you can use your child like curiosity and your
attentive listening skills to get other people to tell you

132
00:15:29.660 --> 00:15:36.640
about their knowledge, experience, and personal interests. 
People will tell you all kinds of things once they know

133
00:15:36.690 --> 00:15:43.730
you're listening. So if you make a legitimate effort to
learn something from every person you meet, you will

134
00:15:43.790 --> 00:15:50.760
constantly be learning. Everyone does different things, goes
different places, hangs out with different people, and has

135
00:15:50.760 --> 00:15:57.230
different points of view. So when you talk to a wide range
of people with the intention of learning from them, you'll

136
00:15:57.230 --> 00:16:06.960
end up having conversations about so many different things. 
Lawyers, doctors, teachers, athletes, artists, single

137
00:16:06.960 --> 00:16:15.350
mothers and fathers, accountants, CEOs, content creators,
students, entrepreneurs, teenagers, adults, senior citizens

138
00:16:15.350 --> 00:16:22.840
- I've talked to and learned from all of them in my private
English classes when theoretically I was supposed to be the

139
00:16:22.840 --> 00:16:30.630
teacher. I listen to these people, tell me their stories,
their ideas and their opinions, and I try to understand what

140
00:16:30.630 --> 00:16:38.420
it's like to be them. I try to see what the world looks like
from their point of view. I encourage them to share all of

141
00:16:38.420 --> 00:16:47.630
their knowledge with me. And guess what happens when I do
that? They share all of their knowledge with me. And why do

142
00:16:47.630 --> 00:16:56.870
they do that? Because I make it clear that I'm curious,
listening, and ready to learn. It's really simple, man. I

143
00:16:56.960 --> 00:17:04.960
promise. By talking to all of these people from different
walks of life, I've gained surface level knowledge of many

144
00:17:04.960 --> 00:17:12.560
different topics. I have an idea of what miners are doing in
Chile and what data analysts are doing in Colombia and what

145
00:17:12.560 --> 00:17:18.400
software developers are doing in Costa Rica and what
entrepreneurs are doing in Indonesia and what medical

146
00:17:18.400 --> 00:17:25.630
students are doing in Burma. I have an idea of the
lifestyles people live in all these different countries. I'm

147
00:17:25.630 --> 00:17:31.810
familiar with the differences in communication styles of the
people from all these different places. And all this makes

148
00:17:31.810 --> 00:17:36.600
it easier for me to speak with new people because I'm
familiar with so many different topics and types of people.

149
00:17:37.560 --> 00:17:43.970
So when I meet a programmer, I can talk about programming.
When I meet a manager working for a gigantic corporation, I

150
00:17:43.970 --> 00:17:49.430
can talk about managing people and communicating
effectively. When I meet someone who works in the

151
00:17:49.430 --> 00:17:56.420
pharmaceutical industry, I can talk about the legality and
morality of selling prescription drugs. Talking to people is

152
00:17:56.420 --> 00:18:02.670
so much easier when you can talk about what people are
interested in because you can let them do all the talking.

153
00:18:04.190 --> 00:18:09.680
When it's your turn to speak, you can speak in terms that
you know they'll understand based on your knowledge of their

154
00:18:09.680 --> 00:18:17.880
personality, communication style, career, and cultural
background. You should be educating yourself constantly.

155
00:18:18.930 --> 00:18:26.290
Never stop learning and exposing yourself to new and useful
things and people. Try new things, man. Visit different

156
00:18:26.290 --> 00:18:35.280
places. Step out of your comfort zone. Talk to strangers,
engage in the art of conversation, humble yourself, and

157
00:18:35.280 --> 00:18:43.730
learn to listen to people with a curious mind. You have so
much more to learn than you think, my friend. And this is

158
00:18:43.730 --> 00:18:49.390
coming from an introvert who would rather chill at home by
himself, making content, and watching anime. I can tell you

159
00:18:49.390 --> 00:18:56.930
this stuff works because it's working for one of the most
introverted and antisocial people I know: me. And I've seen

160
00:18:56.930 --> 00:19:04.290
it work for a bunch of other people, introverted and
extroverted alike. This is universal. Constantly learning

161
00:19:04.290 --> 00:19:09.090
and experiencing new things makes you a more interesting
person because you have more interesting things to share

162
00:19:09.090 --> 00:19:16.890
with other people. And constantly talking to, and more
importantly, listening to other people makes it easier to

163
00:19:16.890 --> 00:19:23.320
talk to anyone because you're constantly talking about
different things. You're constantly improvising. Eventually

164
00:19:23.700 --> 00:19:29.070
you're going to start to recognize patterns across all the
different communication styles and cultural backgrounds and

165
00:19:29.070 --> 00:19:37.230
careers and worldviews, and you'll be able to adapt to them
much more easily. Then, you'll be able to use your childlike

166
00:19:37.230 --> 00:19:46.030
curiosity, your attentive listening skills, your extensive
vocabulary, your ability to simplify ideas, and wide range

167
00:19:46.030 --> 00:19:54.590
of knowledge, to communicate with the world in whichever way
you'd like. That's what great communicators do, and that is

168
00:19:54.590 --> 00:19:55.600
what I'm encouraging you to do.

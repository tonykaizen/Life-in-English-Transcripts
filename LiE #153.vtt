00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:06.020
Tony Kaizen:
What's up, Life in English family? Y'all have been asking me
to make an episode about the word "ain't" for a very, very

2
00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:15.880
long time, and it's finally here. Okay, I'm going to

3
00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:21.830
deliver this episode in three parts. First, I'm going to
teach you all the ways we use this word and in which

4
00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:28.480
context. Second, I'll show you some real world examples of
people using this word, and we'll test your English

5
00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:34.190
comprehension to see how well you understand what's being
said. And finally, I'm going to teach you about the cultural

6
00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:41.610
aspect of this word. So let's take a look at the various
meanings of this word. The first one or the first way we use

7
00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:50.630
this word is in place of the verb "to be", right? So the
word "ain't" can mean "am not" or "is not"

8
00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:57.940
or "are not" and "am", "is", and "are" are conjugations of
the verb "to be", right? So let's start with "am not".

9
00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:08.140
Here's some examples. Number one, "I am not your daddy." "I
am not your daddy." We can say that in a different way,

10
00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:16.900
or we can say that same phrase in a different way by saying,
"I ain't your daddy", so "I am not your daddy" becomes "I

11
00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:25.390
ain't your daddy." Same thing. Okay, next example. "I am not
the one to play with." A more natural way to say that at

12
00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:34.540
least where I'm from is "I ain't the one to play with." And
it's the same thing. Another example. "I am not trippin." Or

13
00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:43.750
"I ain't trippin." Same thing, okay? Now let's look at some
examples of "is not". The first one. "It is not that big of

14
00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:50.650
a deal." "It's not that big of a deal, man." Another way to
say that using the word "ain't" is "It ain't that big of a

15
00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:59.630
deal. Chill, man, it ain't that big of a deal. Relax. Relax,
bro." Alright, another example. "He is not going to want to

16
00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:06.800
do it." I could also say "He ain't gonna want to do it."
Same thing. Another example.

17
00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:15.070
"She is not the type to just sit around and do nothing." I
could also say "She ain't the type to just sit around and do

18
00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:22.590
nothing," and I'd be saying the same thing. So now let's
take a look at some examples of "are not". Number one. "You

19
00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:31.610
are not the one with the problem. I am." Or I could say "You
ain't the one with the problem. I am." Okay? Another

20
00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:39.750
example. "You are not the boss of me." Or I could say "You
ain't the boss of me." Same thing.

21
00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:48.780
Alright, another example. Last one. "You are not shit." We
would never say this naturally in casual conversation. The

22
00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:54.780
version of this phrase using the word "ain't" is what we
would say. So I'll say that now, "You ain't shit."

23
00:02:55.690 --> 00:03:00.530
Technically, you're saying "You are not shit," but that
sounds weird. But when I say "You ain't shit," that sounds

24
00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:06.190
natural to me and that expression just means you're not
worth anything. Similar to saying that somebody is a piece

25
00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:13.180
of shit. So if somebody says "Man, you ain't shit," it's
like, depending on who says it in the context, it could be a

26
00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:19.550
joke or it could be a bad thing that means you're just
worthless. You're a worthless human being. Alright. But

27
00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:28.280
anyway, that is "am not", "is not", and "are not", okay?
Another way we can use the word "ain't" is in place of "has

28
00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:31.180
not" and "have nots".

29
00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:39.340
So let me give you some examples starting with "has not".
Number one, "He hasn't..." or "He has not been himself

30
00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:48.300
lately." I could also say "He ain't been himself lately,"
and it's the same thing. Another example, "She hasn't..." or

31
00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:57.050
"She has not even called him yet." "She hasn't even called
them yet." Or I could say "She ain't even called him yet."

32
00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:06.660
Alright. Another example. "It hasn't even been 5 minutes."
Or "It ain't even been 5 minutes." Alright. Now, here are

33
00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:15.770
some examples of "have not". Number one, "I have not seen
you in a while." Or "I ain't seen you in a while."

34
00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:25.260
Same thing. Okay, another example. "You have not done it
since last week." Or "You ain't done it since last week,

35
00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:26.630
bro." Alright.

36
00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:34.720
Another example. "They have not called me yet." Or "They
ain't called me yet." Same thing.

37
00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:42.050
Now, another way we can use the word "ain't" is in place of
"do not" and "did not" in specific cases. So let me give you

38
00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:50.810
some examples for "do not". "I do not have time for this."
"I do not have time for this." Another way I can say that is

39
00:04:51.150 --> 00:05:00.150
"I ain't got time for this," and it's the same thing.
Alright. Another example. "I do not have any money." Or "I

40
00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:06.350
ain't got no money." And it's the same...I'm saying the same
exact thing, okay? Now, some examples of "did not". Number

41
00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:13.500
one. "I did not ask for that." Or "I ain't ask for that."
Okay?

42
00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:23.620
Another example. "We didn't know what to do." "We didn't
know what to do." Or "We ain't know what to do." The same

43
00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:30.440
thing as saying "We did not know what to do." Okay, now the
last way we can use this is not necessarily a definition,

44
00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:37.770
but we often use the word "ain't" in sentences that involve
"nobody". So let me give you an example. In standard

45
00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:43.630
English, you might say something like, "No one called you,"
right? Maybe somebody walks into the room and says, "Hey,

46
00:05:43.630 --> 00:05:52.190
did you call me?" "No, no one called you." Right? Another
way I could say that is, "Ain't nobody call you." Like "Nah.

47
00:05:52.190 --> 00:05:58.540
Ain't nobody call you, bro. Relax, ain't nobody call you."
And I'm...what I'm saying is "Nobody called you." Or "No one

48
00:05:58.850 --> 00:06:06.170
called you." Another example. "No one wants to hear that."
Maybe your music is trash or you're just...you're

49
00:06:06.610 --> 00:06:12.620
complaining, you're whining, something like that. Something
that nobody wants to hear. You can say "Nobody wants to hear

50
00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:21.700
that." Or "No one wants to hear that." Or you could say,
"Ain't nobody trying to hear that, bruh." "Ain't nobody

51
00:06:21.910 --> 00:06:28.020
trying to hear that." So it's just an informal dialect of
English and I'm just trying to get you to understand that

52
00:06:28.620 --> 00:06:33.760
it's the same thing as saying "No one wants to hear that."
It's just a different way of speaking and I won't get into

53
00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:38.980
the details of that way of speaking in this episode, because
this episode is about the word "ain't" so let's stay on

54
00:06:38.980 --> 00:06:46.570
topic. Next example, "No one is concerned with..." or
"paying attention to you." That's a standard English phrase.

55
00:06:47.100 --> 00:06:53.880
But I could also say, "Ain't nobody worried about you,
bruh." So alright. So "No one is concerned with you." "No

56
00:06:53.880 --> 00:07:01.060
one is paying attention to you." Or "Ain't nobody worried
about you." It's the same thing, just a more informal way of

57
00:07:01.060 --> 00:07:08.790
saying it, okay? Now, we've gone over all the definitions
and uses, or at least the basics of the definitions and uses

58
00:07:08.830 --> 00:07:16.100
of the word "ain't". Now we are going to test your English,
my friend, and see how much you can actually understand when

59
00:07:16.100 --> 00:07:20.660
you hear real people using this word. So let's take a look
at the first example.

60
00:07:23.980 --> 00:07:30.780
First Example (woman):
"Um, this whole, you know, sort of finding compassion and
common ground with your enemies thing is kind of like a

61
00:07:30.780 --> 00:07:35.300
political, spiritual practice for me. And I ain't the Dalai
Lama."

62
00:07:37.400 --> 00:07:44.810
Tony Kaizen:
Alright. So did you hear what she said? She said, "I ain't
the Dalai Lama." Now, what does that mean? How would you say

63
00:07:44.810 --> 00:07:54.270
that in standard English? Well, I would say, "I'm not the
Dalai Lama" or "I am not the Dalai Lama." So "I am not"

64
00:07:54.370 --> 00:08:00.070
becomes "I ain't". And just in case you're sitting there
wondering, "What is a Dalai Lama? What is that? How do you

65
00:08:00.070 --> 00:08:09.890
even spell that?" Well, Dalai Lama in English is spelled
D-a-l-a-i, Dalai...L-a-m-a,

66
00:08:10.120 --> 00:08:16.550
Lama, and I'm sure I'm pronouncing that incorrectly. I don't
know how you actually say that, but in standard American

67
00:08:16.550 --> 00:08:23.010
English we say Dalai Lama. And the way I understand it, if
I'm not mistaken, this is what they call the spiritual

68
00:08:23.010 --> 00:08:27.900
leader of Tibetan Buddhism, just in case you were wondering.
But let's move on to the next example.

69
00:08:30.410 --> 00:08:32.990
Second Example (man):
"Well, well, that's it. I mean, why why undergo..."

70
00:08:32.990 --> 00:08:33.890
Second Example (woman):
"The mayor...mayor..."

71
00:08:34.320 --> 00:08:42.260
Second Example (man):
"...the scrutiny and the brickbats and the disrespect and
everything else? I mean, that takes a certain type of

72
00:08:42.260 --> 00:08:45.340
psychological makeup to, you know, want to withstand..."

73
00:08:45.340 --> 00:08:48.150
Second Example (woman):
"It's what Sanders says really, is you need a revolution."

74
00:08:48.960 --> 00:08:51.050
Second Example (man):
"Yeah, but you ain't getting a revolution."

75
00:08:54.180 --> 00:09:01.310
Tony Kaizen:
Alright. So did you guys catch that one? The woman said,
"You need a revolution." And the man said, "But you ain't

76
00:09:01.370 --> 00:09:09.360
getting a revolution. You ain't getting one." Right? So how
would you say that in standard English? I would say, "You

77
00:09:09.420 --> 00:09:16.720
are not getting a revolution." "You are not getting a
revolution." "You ain't getting a revolution, my friend."

78
00:09:16.890 --> 00:09:22.250
Same thing. So "you are not" becomes "you ain't." Alright,
next example.

79
00:09:22.250 --> 00:09:26.650
Third Example (man):
"And then finally, licenses and approval.

80
00:09:26.650 --> 00:09:33.140
So you have a license to do something that is not many
people can do or an approval that is a pretty solid economic

81
00:09:33.140 --> 00:09:38.970
moat. Casinos, not easy to get a casino license here. Six of
them in Macau. That's it. They ain't giving out anymore."

82
00:09:40.960 --> 00:09:46.150
Tony Kaizen:
Alright. So hopefully you guys caught that. This guy is
talking about...He's really talking about...Excuse me...He's

83
00:09:46.870 --> 00:09:53.420
talking about different businesses and he ended by talking
about casinos, right? Apparently, you need a license to open

84
00:09:53.420 --> 00:10:00.870
a casino, and the man said, "They ain't giving out anymore."
So how would you say that in standard English? Well, I would

85
00:10:00.870 --> 00:10:08.420
say, "They are not giving out anymore." "They are not"
becomes "they ain't." And you might be asking yourself,

86
00:10:08.420 --> 00:10:15.050
"What does giving out mean?" Well, in this context, it means
"to distribute", okay? So basically what he's saying is

87
00:10:15.050 --> 00:10:22.610
they're not distributing or they're not issuing or "giving
out" more casino licenses so you cannot attain one anymore.

88
00:10:22.800 --> 00:10:27.990
That's the basic idea of what he was saying but the focus is
on the word "ain't" so hopefully you understood that part.

89
00:10:28.700 --> 00:10:30.940
So let's move on to the last example.

90
00:10:33.510 --> 00:10:41.010
Last Example (man):
"This is going really, really, really focused on money, on
your relationship with money, and it teaches a system of how

91
00:10:41.010 --> 00:10:45.920
to manage money because the theory is when you get to the
point where you're able to manage your money, even if you

92
00:10:45.920 --> 00:10:51.690
ain't got none, right? You manage the budget and you manage
what little you have coherently, then the magic of the

93
00:10:51.690 --> 00:10:54.680
universe is that when we prove we can manage some, we will
get more."

94
00:10:55.760 --> 00:11:02.720
Tony Kaizen:
Alright. So in that clip, he was talking about money,
managing money, and he said something like, "Once you learn

95
00:11:02.720 --> 00:11:09.430
how to manage your money, even if you ain't got none, even
if you ain't got none..." So what does that mean? How would

96
00:11:09.430 --> 00:11:16.680
you say that in standard English? Well, I would say, "Even
if you don't have any," because remember, we're talking

97
00:11:16.680 --> 00:11:24.060
about money. So once you learn how to manage your money,
even if "you don't have any" or even if "you ain't got

98
00:11:24.130 --> 00:11:30.670
none," then you will get more. That's the idea. And this is
an example of a super common sentence structure, right?

99
00:11:31.060 --> 00:11:38.030
"Ain't got no." It's really, really common in some places
here in the US, and remember, this just means "does not

100
00:11:38.030 --> 00:11:43.720
have" or "do not have". It's the same thing. So the idea
here is that you need to learn how to manage your money,

101
00:11:44.020 --> 00:11:51.640
even if "you don't have any" or even if "you ain't got
none", and you will receive more. Alright? So, my friend,

102
00:11:51.640 --> 00:11:57.250
now, let me tell you about the linguistic characteristics of
this word. And this is probably the most important part of

103
00:11:57.250 --> 00:12:01.650
this episode, because there's a lot of conflicting
information about the word "ain't" and whether it's

104
00:12:01.650 --> 00:12:08.550
grammatically correct or incorrect. Now, linguistically,
"ain't" is formed by the same rule that English speakers use

105
00:12:08.550 --> 00:12:16.880
to form "aren't" and other contractions of auxiliary verbs
like "isn't" or "won't" or "doesn't", etc.. Now linguists

106
00:12:16.880 --> 00:12:22.600
consider usage of the word "ain't" to be grammatical as long
as its users convey their intended meaning to their

107
00:12:22.690 --> 00:12:30.100
audience. In other words, a sentence such as, "She ain't got
no sense." is grammatically correct because it generally

108
00:12:30.100 --> 00:12:36.710
follows a native's word order...a native speaker's word
order, I mean. And because a native speaker would recognize

109
00:12:36.710 --> 00:12:43.840
the meaning of that sentence, it's grammatically correct,
you see? But linguists draw a distinction, however, between

110
00:12:43.840 --> 00:12:51.040
grammatically "correct" and "acceptable", you see? What may
be considered "grammatically correct" across many dialects

111
00:12:51.040 --> 00:12:59.340
may nevertheless, or may still be considered unacceptable in
certain dialects or certain contexts, right? The usage of

112
00:12:59.340 --> 00:13:05.770
the word "ain't" is "socially unacceptable" in some
situations, but it's not "grammatically incorrect". Right?

113
00:13:05.770 --> 00:13:12.390
Because natives actually use that word in a logical way.
Their sentences follow an actual pattern. There's a real

114
00:13:12.390 --> 00:13:17.540
structure there that they use and understand so it's correct
to them, and I should say "us", because I'm talking about

115
00:13:17.630 --> 00:13:24.790
us, right? Now, the usage of the word "ain't" is a
continuing subject of controversy in the English language

116
00:13:24.790 --> 00:13:31.760
and the English education industry, if we can call it that,
right? Now, "ain't" is commonly used by many native speakers

117
00:13:31.760 --> 00:13:38.910
in oral and informal settings, especially in certain regions
or dialects of English. Now it's usage is often highly

118
00:13:39.060 --> 00:13:45.430
stigmatized, and it can be used by the general public as a
marker of low socioeconomic status or education level,

119
00:13:46.030 --> 00:13:53.600
right? It's generally used or it's not used...it's generally
considered nonstandard English in most dictionaries. But in

120
00:13:53.600 --> 00:14:00.180
my humble opinion, trying to classify people by the way they
speak is an elitist's way of segregating and judging people

121
00:14:00.610 --> 00:14:05.580
based on something that doesn't say anything about a
person's character, right? Like there isn't a right or wrong

122
00:14:05.580 --> 00:14:13.680
way to speak. There isn't a high or low class way of
speaking. There are simply different ways of speaking. And

123
00:14:13.680 --> 00:14:18.600
people from different regions speak in different ways. And
just because people in my city speak differently from the

124
00:14:18.600 --> 00:14:25.930
people in New York City doesn't mean one of us is speaking
incorrectly. Everyone in my city understands me perfectly,

125
00:14:25.930 --> 00:14:32.790
so I'm obviously speaking correctly. It's all subjective,
which is exactly why it makes no sense to try to determine

126
00:14:32.790 --> 00:14:40.590
what the correct way of speaking is because it doesn't
exist. If the sentence follows the typical pattern of speech

127
00:14:40.590 --> 00:14:47.990
that a native will use, then it's grammatically correct. If
a native understands it but simply thinks you shouldn't say

128
00:14:47.990 --> 00:14:54.040
it, that doesn't mean it's incorrect. It means that person
thinks what you said was unacceptable. So always try to

129
00:14:54.040 --> 00:15:00.260
remember there's a difference between those two things. But
why do I think that understanding the social aspect of this

130
00:15:00.260 --> 00:15:06.480
word is so important? It's because after teaching English
for a few years, I met a lot of people who pride themselves

131
00:15:06.480 --> 00:15:12.980
on knowing things about slang, informal dialects and what
they know of as "Black English". But most of them don't

132
00:15:12.980 --> 00:15:20.100
really understand why we say the things we say. People will
hear a native say something and simply repeat it. And of

133
00:15:20.100 --> 00:15:26.580
course, that's normal. I'm just saying that it's important
to truly understand what it is you're saying and why you are

134
00:15:26.580 --> 00:15:32.650
saying it. It's important to understand how a community of
people will see and interpret your words and behavior when

135
00:15:32.650 --> 00:15:39.970
you speak a certain way or use certain words, and you don't
have to care, but you should understand. So in this

136
00:15:39.970 --> 00:15:45.510
particular case, with the word "ain't", you need to
understand that there are a lot of elitist and snobby people

137
00:15:45.510 --> 00:15:51.700
who are going to look down on you for using words like
"ain't" or speaking some informal dialect of English. There

138
00:15:51.700 --> 00:15:57.060
are people who would think you're of low class or you're
uneducated or you're from the streets, or you grew up on a

139
00:15:57.060 --> 00:16:04.980
farm somewhere in the country. But the reality is people of
all colors, classes, and ages use this word in daily

140
00:16:04.980 --> 00:16:11.470
conversations. It just depends on where you're from and the
context of the situation. So once you understand this word

141
00:16:11.470 --> 00:16:19.000
and how to use it, feel free to use it in any informal
conversation. Now, another thing I want to say about the

142
00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:24.670
social aspect of this word is that if you want to speak an
informal dialect of English or you want to use slang just

143
00:16:24.670 --> 00:16:32.590
like a native, you've got to remember that it's not just
what you say, it's how you say it. In fact, how you say it

144
00:16:32.720 --> 00:16:37.760
is really what makes all the difference. That's why I'm
always teaching you how we really speak, but reminding you

145
00:16:37.760 --> 00:16:43.460
that you don't have to speak the same way. Many times, you
might end up sounding even more unnatural because you're

146
00:16:43.460 --> 00:16:50.700
just so determined to use slang and idioms but you only know
the definitions of the words and phrases. You still don't

147
00:16:50.700 --> 00:16:57.060
know how to express them like a native does. So just take
some time to really understand the culture of the people

148
00:16:57.060 --> 00:17:05.790
like whom you're trying to speak and what makes their way of
communicating unique. And as always, practice, practice, and

149
00:17:05.790 --> 00:17:12.490
practice some more. Now, if you find this episode helpful,

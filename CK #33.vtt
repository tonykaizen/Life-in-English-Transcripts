00:00:01.070 --> 00:00:03.070
You know, they say social media has ruined the world.

2
00:00:03.940 --> 00:00:05.850
They say it's ruined an entire generation.

3
00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:13.740
They say that it's the reason that so many people are anxious in social situations.

4
00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:18.000
So many people are insecure. So many people are miserable and depressed.

5
00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:24.260
But you know, after a couple of years hearing about this subject,

6
00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:27.750
Thinking about this subject, I don't know if that's true, bro.

7
00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:32.860
I was watching a couple of videos actually a while back,

8
00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:38.430
And this guy named Gary Vee was talking about this specific subject, you know,

9
00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:42.670
How everybody has their opinions about social media and a lot of people in general.

10
00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:46.530
Have negative things to say about social media, like all the things I just said.

11
00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:52.640
But the reality is that social media hasn't really changed anything

12
00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:56.960
In terms of human behavior or society or anything like that.

13
00:00:57.340 --> 00:00:59.970
I can't say for sure that it hasn't changed anything.

14
00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:04.460
But what I'm trying to say right now is that social media hasn't changed us,

15
00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:08.420
It's simply revealed us. You know?

16
00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:14.230
I think social media just made it more apparent who we really are,

17
00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:17.450
What we really think, what's really important to us,

18
00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:18.910
What we're really about. You know what I'm saying?

19
00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:25.120
So if you are just like an insecure person, social media just exacerbated that problem.

20
00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:29.600
It didn't create the problem. Like, the problem was pre-existing. You know what I'm saying?

21
00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:36.970
And social media just gave people a way to make the problem worse.

22
00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:42.910
I don't know if that makes sense to you. But another example,

23
00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:47.160
Like if you're a really vain person. And it's all about you,

24
00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:50.280
You need the attention, you want the spotlight and that kind of thing.

25
00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:53.310
Social media just gave you an avenue to pursue that even more.

26
00:01:53.310 --> 00:02:00.440
It didn't make you that way. It just allows you to be more that way or to be more of that,

27
00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:03.860
I guess is a more natural way to say it. You know?

28
00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:07.100
The same thing with like bitch ass niggas.

29
00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:09.760
If you were a bitch ass nigga before you download social media.

30
00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:16.510
Social media... I think that's who's winning these days on social media is the bitch ass niggas

31
00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:20.340
Because they finally found a place where they can be bitch ass niggas

32
00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:25.100
Without suffering the consequences of being a bitch. You know what I'm saying?

33
00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:27.820
And what I mean by that is like,

34
00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:34.740
I'm sure you've seen or experienced yourself at some point to some little bitch who is so miserable,

35
00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:39.950
So sad, so insecure that they feel the need to reach out to other people online

36
00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:46.570
And spread that hate and that negativity, you know, that insecurity and all that type of stuff.

37
00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:51.450
Somebody who's in the comment section just talking shit.

38
00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:56.840
Criticizing you or whoever made the video or the post or whatever it is.

39
00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:59.330
Just talking shit, being a little bitch.

40
00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:02.680
Saying shit that they would never say to your face, you know?

41
00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:07.020
And typically it's like miserable little like boys. I don't know.

42
00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:16.440
I don't get too many negative comments or bullshit comments from females I've noticed.

43
00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:23.080
Generally is guys. Just miserable guys at home like on their cell phone

44
00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:27.130
Just so miserable and they see something that makes them feel some kind of way

45
00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:28.200
Or they don't like it and they're like,

46
00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:30.820
Nah, I just got to... I got to put my 2 cents in.

47
00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:36.190
My fucking rusty two little punk ass pennies. I got to put them in there.

48
00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:41.440
And the thing is, getting back to my point is like, in real life,

49
00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:43.880
In the real world, at least where I'm from, where I grew up,

50
00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:47.440
Where I went to high school and stuff like that, where I live now, shit.

51
00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:54.830
If you just go around talking shit, disrespecting people, hating on people,

52
00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:59.530
Trying to bring people down, you know, you're not going to have many friends, bro.

53
00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:03.830
You're not going to be the type of person that people want to be around, typically.

54
00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:09.350
You might find some other miserable motherfuckers who identify with you

55
00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:11.050
And all of y'all can just be miserable together.

56
00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:13.460
But most likely you're going to be very lonely

57
00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:17.720
Because most people don't want to be around the negative little bitch.

58
00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:20.890
You know what I'm saying? Most people don't.

59
00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:24.450
And the thing is like, as a man, you know...

60
00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:26.600
I don't know, ladies I don't know if you'll understand this.

61
00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:37.180
But as a man like, respect I think is one of the most important things to us. Respect.

62
00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:42.190
And if you go around in person, in real life, go around like,

63
00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:48.910
You walk up to a man who is I don't know, let's say he's a musician. Who cares?

64
00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:51.310
But for the example, let's say he's a musician,

65
00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:56.460
And you walk up to him and you just start talking shit. Your music is trash.

66
00:04:56.570 --> 00:04:59.830
You're a bitch. You're ugly. Your style is wack. Blah, blah, blah.

67
00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:03.960
Like, a lot of guys, including myself probably won't care because it's just words,

68
00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:07.500
You're just talking shit. But if you keep... If you do that long enough,

69
00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:13.660
If you keep disrespecting person after person, eventually you're going to come across the wrong one, bro.

70
00:05:14.890 --> 00:05:18.780
Eventually. Like, there's a lot of people out there and we're all similar, but we're different.

71
00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:21.290
So you might get away with, you know,

72
00:05:21.290 --> 00:05:24.240
Being a disrespectful little bitch four or five times,

73
00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:27.890
Ten or eleven times, thirty or thirty-one times.

74
00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:33.730
But eventually, you get to number 32 who is not with the bullshit.

75
00:05:34.290 --> 00:05:38.740
And you come up talking shit, disrespecting this man and he's going to slap the taste out of your mouth.

76
00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:44.150
And maybe you don't know what that means, to get the taste slapped out of your mouth.

77
00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:50.040
To slap the taste out of someone's mouth, I don't know if it's like an idiom or an expression,

78
00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:54.640
But it's something that we say and it basically means to slap somebody in the mouth

79
00:05:54.640 --> 00:06:01.520
So hard that they cannot taste anymore. You know, literally that's what it means.

80
00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:04.430
But it just really means to slap somebody really, really, really, really hard.

81
00:06:05.790 --> 00:06:08.930
You know, and it's just an expression that we use from time to time,

82
00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:12.740
Like "Nigga, I'll slap the taste out of your mouth. Fucking with me". You know what I'm saying?

83
00:06:15.130 --> 00:06:18.260
But yeah, back to my point. You disrespect the wrong one, bro.

84
00:06:18.390 --> 00:06:21.420
Like a lot of people, myself included, would just let it slide.

85
00:06:21.650 --> 00:06:28.760
Like, I'm at the point in life now where generally words like, don't have much of an effect on me.

86
00:06:29.130 --> 00:06:32.400
If somebody is talking shit or whatever, it's like, okay, whatever, bro.

87
00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:41.530
But some people are just not that evolved, let's say. And you pushed the wrong button, bro.

88
00:06:41.530 --> 00:06:45.120
Your jaw is going to get tested. You know?

89
00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:50.540
So social media is just, like, gave bitch ass niggas a platform to be little bitches,

90
00:06:50.540 --> 00:06:53.300
But they don't have the consequences of being a bitch.

91
00:06:53.300 --> 00:06:56.550
Because in real life there are real consequences depending on the situation.

92
00:06:56.550 --> 00:07:01.820
But on social media, you just send out the message and you don't really ever feel anything sent back to you.

93
00:07:02.270 --> 00:07:04.180
Even if you get a comment back, it's just a comment.

94
00:07:05.580 --> 00:07:07.490
And I imagine bitches niggas feed off that shit.

95
00:07:07.490 --> 00:07:10.440
They want the negative interaction, they want those comments and shit like that.

96
00:07:10.510 --> 00:07:14.820
They want to know that they made you feel some type of way. That they got you.

97
00:07:15.090 --> 00:07:17.030
You know what I'm saying? You read their comment.

98
00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:21.610
And that comment made you feel some kind of way and they got you. Right?

99
00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:24.810
Even if just for a second, they got you. That's what they want.

100
00:07:27.550 --> 00:07:29.900
So getting back to the original point, it's like that...

101
00:07:31.660 --> 00:07:35.620
I don't think social media created that, it just facilitated that behavior.

102
00:07:36.130 --> 00:07:42.130
It already existed, you know? I think now it just...

103
00:07:42.190 --> 00:07:47.090
It's much more clear who people are and what they're about when they present themselves on social media.

104
00:07:47.380 --> 00:07:49.990
You can tell a lot. Not everything, of course.

105
00:07:49.990 --> 00:07:56.450
Because, you know, you can only show so much of yourself on social media

106
00:07:56.450 --> 00:07:59.110
And you get to choose how you show yourself on social media.

107
00:07:59.110 --> 00:08:03.800
So it's not like we're seeing who people really are 100%.

108
00:08:03.800 --> 00:08:07.690
But what I'm saying is you see what people are really about when you pay attention to what they say and do.

109
00:08:09.190 --> 00:08:12.610
So, whatever people are saying and doing on social media,

110
00:08:12.710 --> 00:08:14.550
I don't think it's because we have social media,

111
00:08:14.620 --> 00:08:17.630
I think that's just who they were and now they get a chance to express it.

112
00:08:18.670 --> 00:08:24.120
We get to see it, you know? I don't know.

113
00:08:24.560 --> 00:08:29.240
Anyway, man, this is Coffee with Kaizen number 33, if I'm not mistaken.

114
00:08:30.080 --> 00:08:33.560
And if you haven't noticed by now, I'm talking about nothing, man.

115
00:08:33.890 --> 00:08:36.070
Talking about a bunch of stuff, but nothing in particular.

116
00:08:36.760 --> 00:08:38.690
It's just been a while since I sat down to record.

117
00:08:38.690 --> 00:08:40.480
I wanted to say what's up to you. You know what I'm saying?

118
00:08:41.800 --> 00:08:46.150
And that was on my mind before I started recording because as you might know,

119
00:08:46.560 --> 00:08:53.110
I got a pretty large following on TikTok. And that's where I get like,

120
00:08:53.110 --> 00:08:58.110
The most interaction, the most comments, the most, you know, engagement, let's say.

121
00:08:58.970 --> 00:09:03.000
And of course, you know, once you get past a certain number of like followers,

122
00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:07.250
And video views consistently, you just get all kinds of people watching your videos,

123
00:09:07.250 --> 00:09:09.150
Commenting, sharing, etc. Right?

124
00:09:11.070 --> 00:09:13.700
And I won't say all the time, but quite often you just get

125
00:09:13.730 --> 00:09:16.310
These little bitch ass niggas leaving bitch ass comments.

126
00:09:16.310 --> 00:09:21.230
And sometimes I read the comments... Because I try to read a lot of them from time to time.

127
00:09:21.230 --> 00:09:25.230
I don't spend too much time on social just reading and interacting anymore

128
00:09:26.080 --> 00:09:29.360
Because I just don't have time for it. But I still, at least a couple of times a week,

129
00:09:29.360 --> 00:09:31.690
Try to get in there and read some comments, answer questions,

130
00:09:32.570 --> 00:09:36.540
Get new ideas for videos, and stuff like that. So you just see, you know,

131
00:09:36.540 --> 00:09:38.880
Scattered throughout the long list of comments and shit,

132
00:09:39.560 --> 00:09:45.030
Just some bitch ass niggas who are miserable and feel the need to bring that negativity to what I'm doing. You know?

133
00:09:45.030 --> 00:09:49.810
And that's what made me think about it this morning before I started recording.

134
00:09:49.880 --> 00:09:54.750
I'm just like, Man, some of these niggas have never been punched in the face, clearly.

135
00:09:56.780 --> 00:09:58.830
Some of these niggas just don't know what it feels like to get

136
00:10:00.220 --> 00:10:03.460
Punched in the fucking face for being a disrespectful little bitch.

137
00:10:03.460 --> 00:10:08.080
They just don't know what it feels like. Because in my opinion, somebody who knows what that feels like,

138
00:10:08.280 --> 00:10:18.630
Somebody who's experienced that before knows that that's not the way one should behave. You know what I'm saying?

139
00:10:18.630 --> 00:10:22.160
And I'm speaking for myself, obviously,

140
00:10:22.160 --> 00:10:27.190
Like I've been a disrespectful little bitch with a bad attitude before, and guess what happened?

141
00:10:29.300 --> 00:10:35.510
My behavior got corrected by a nigga much bigger and stronger than me.

142
00:10:35.510 --> 00:10:39.810
He beat the shit out of me. So I think once that happens to you once or twice,

143
00:10:39.810 --> 00:10:44.490
You kind of understand there's ways to behave and there's ways not to behave.

144
00:10:45.700 --> 00:10:50.110
And being a disrespectful human being is not a proper way to behave.

145
00:10:50.170 --> 00:10:52.550
Not if you want to live a peaceful life, you know.

146
00:10:52.550 --> 00:10:55.780
Because like I said, you might get away with it here and there,

147
00:10:55.780 --> 00:11:01.940
But eventually, you're going to try the wrong one and get fucked up.

148
00:11:02.430 --> 00:11:04.300
You're gonna get fucked up, man. For real.

149
00:11:05.410 --> 00:11:12.130
So, yeah. Just be careful, man. Just be careful.

150
00:11:12.130 --> 00:11:14.270
Maybe you're a badass. Maybe you don't care.

151
00:11:14.270 --> 00:11:18.110
Maybe you could beat anyone's ass so you're not afraid to say what you want to say

152
00:11:18.110 --> 00:11:21.390
Or be disrespectful, have a bad attitude, or whatever.

153
00:11:21.390 --> 00:11:25.380
And if that's the case, you know, do what you got to do. You know?

154
00:11:25.380 --> 00:11:35.780
Good for you, I guess. But most people, bad choice, man. That's a bad choice.

155
00:11:37.020 --> 00:11:40.690
Don't be a bitch ass nigga, all right? Don't be a bitch ass nigga.

156
00:11:41.460 --> 00:11:44.300
Also, don't... I've been saying, I just noticed I've been saying that a lot.

157
00:11:44.860 --> 00:11:51.070
Be very careful using that term "bitch ass nigga". Maybe you don't know what that means.

158
00:11:51.770 --> 00:11:58.860
A bitch ass nigga is kind of like, a coward. Yeah. Yeah.

159
00:11:58.920 --> 00:12:03.960
Bitch ass nigga is basically a coward or fucking lame. You know?

160
00:12:03.960 --> 00:12:09.280
Somebody who wasn't raised right, doesn't have the right values. You know what I'm saying?

161
00:12:09.300 --> 00:12:16.860
No respect. Just a little coward. And that cowardice manifests itself in his or her behavior.

162
00:12:16.860 --> 00:12:20.640
Typically, we call a man a bitch ass nigga. If it was a woman,

163
00:12:20.640 --> 00:12:26.120
Probably just call her a bitch and they would have the same idea or meaning in this context.

164
00:12:26.440 --> 00:12:28.320
You know what I'm saying? Just a coward.

165
00:12:28.750 --> 00:12:32.800
Somebody with a bad attitude, no respect, no values. You know?

166
00:12:33.380 --> 00:12:38.610
But 'nigga', as I'm sure you know, is a complicated word that I don't recommend you say.

167
00:12:39.730 --> 00:12:43.630
As I always say, you can say whatever you want, but I'm just...

168
00:12:44.500 --> 00:12:49.450
Just letting you know I recommend that you do not use the word 'nigga'.

169
00:12:49.750 --> 00:12:52.740
So you can say "that bitch ass guy", doesn't sound as natural.

170
00:12:54.320 --> 00:12:57.290
Or "that bitch ass dude". Or you can just, you can call a man a bitch, too.

171
00:12:57.290 --> 00:13:01.280
That nigga is a bitch. You see, I keep saying 'nigga' just because it's a part of my speech.

172
00:13:01.350 --> 00:13:05.570
But, yeah. Anyway, just be careful with that one.

173
00:13:11.300 --> 00:13:13.960
Hang on a second. I wrote down a couple of talking points

174
00:13:13.960 --> 00:13:16.840
Because I wanted to talk about nothing in particular,

175
00:13:16.840 --> 00:13:21.590
But at least have some direction so I'm not just rambling for the next hour and a half.

176
00:13:22.810 --> 00:13:24.160
I really only wrote down three things.

177
00:13:24.160 --> 00:13:26.710
The first one was that social media stuff I just told you about.

178
00:13:27.650 --> 00:13:33.010
And the other thing that was on my mind was the idea of having animals as pets

179
00:13:33.010 --> 00:13:39.000
Because every morning I might enjoy a cup of coffee out on my balcony and I can look...

180
00:13:39.190 --> 00:13:45.950
I live on the second floor and I know in other countries you guys talk about floors in different ways.

181
00:13:45.950 --> 00:13:52.980
So let me explain that really quickly. In the U.S. in a building that has more than one floor.

182
00:13:54.190 --> 00:13:59.160
The floor that you enter the building on is called the 'ground floor'.

183
00:14:00.470 --> 00:14:03.070
So let's imagine you're going to a hotel. You park your car.

184
00:14:03.500 --> 00:14:07.100
You get out of the car and you walk into the hotel. You're on the ground floor.

185
00:14:08.390 --> 00:14:11.380
Quite literally, because you're on the ground. You're standing on the ground.

186
00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:19.030
But that's also, how can I say... Not also, I'm getting confused here.

187
00:14:19.540 --> 00:14:23.820
So you walk into the building, that's the ground floor. Then you go up to the first floor.

188
00:14:24.400 --> 00:14:28.730
But now I'm not sure because the ground floor and the first floor I'm pretty sure are the same thing.

189
00:14:32.300 --> 00:14:38.770
Damn, I'm confusing myself. Let's get on to the Googles and make sure that's true.

190
00:14:38.770 --> 00:14:41.930
I'm pretty sure. I would call it the first floor. Yeah, I know it is.

191
00:14:42.090 --> 00:14:50.510
Ground floor is the first floor. All right, let's see.

192
00:14:53.480 --> 00:14:57.310
In British English, the floor of a building at street level is called the ground floor,

193
00:14:57.990 --> 00:15:00.710
And the floor above is the ground floor.

194
00:15:01.390 --> 00:15:05.980
And the floor above it is the ground floor, It is called the first floor.

195
00:15:06.040 --> 00:15:12.150
Who the fuck wrote that sentence? Yeah. So in American English, however,

196
00:15:12.150 --> 00:15:15.060
The floor at street level is usually called the first floor. That's what I thought.

197
00:15:15.420 --> 00:15:22.350
So the floor at street level, on the ground is both the ground floor and the first floor.

198
00:15:23.100 --> 00:15:27.150
You can call it either one. I'm staying on the ground floor of this hotel

199
00:15:27.240 --> 00:15:30.520
Or I'm on the first floor of this hotel. It's the same thing.

200
00:15:30.880 --> 00:15:35.040
Now, when you go upstairs to the next level, to the next floor, that is the second floor.

201
00:15:35.780 --> 00:15:39.250
Now, I know in many other countries that's not the case. Like, for example, in Brazil,

202
00:15:39.460 --> 00:15:47.270
The first floor is the floor that you have to walk up the stairs to reach. You see what I'm saying?

203
00:15:47.300 --> 00:15:52.120
So they have the ground floor, then you go upstairs to the first floor, then second and third, etc.

204
00:15:52.120 --> 00:15:55.580
But in the U.S, the first floor is also the ground floor.

205
00:15:56.030 --> 00:16:01.130
Why I was telling you about that? I don't remember. Ah yeah, pets.

206
00:16:01.200 --> 00:16:03.530
So I live on the second floor in an apartment.

207
00:16:03.770 --> 00:16:06.160
So I was looking downstairs and every morning this guy,

208
00:16:07.130 --> 00:16:12.890
He has two medium-sized dogs and he takes them outside to use the bathroom and do what they do.

209
00:16:13.910 --> 00:16:19.480
And I was just sitting there thinking, man, like, how strange it is to keep an animal as a pet.

210
00:16:19.480 --> 00:16:26.740
That is such a strange concept. You don't think so? That's strange, dog.

211
00:16:26.740 --> 00:16:30.520
Like to... And dogs and cats specifically, no other animals.

212
00:16:31.280 --> 00:16:35.430
I mean, other people have like, snakes, and lizards and fish, birds.

213
00:16:35.740 --> 00:16:38.130
But animals in general, like just to keep them as pets,

214
00:16:38.130 --> 00:16:44.600
To keep them locked up in your apartment, holding them hostage. Like, that's weird to me.

215
00:16:45.660 --> 00:16:52.390
And I know a lot of people say, well, I rescued this animal or I'm feeding this animal,

216
00:16:52.390 --> 00:16:56.210
I'm giving it a nice home, I take care of it. So, you know, it's fair.

217
00:16:56.210 --> 00:17:00.910
And if they wanted to leave, they could. But could they? Could they really?

218
00:17:02.910 --> 00:17:08.910
Could they really especially those pets that were born inside, they were born in captivity.

219
00:17:09.910 --> 00:17:11.580
Could they really leave if they wanted to, bro?

220
00:17:11.580 --> 00:17:14.790
Could they really leave your house and then survive in the wild?

221
00:17:16.860 --> 00:17:19.960
Could they find a way to feed themselves, protect themselves from other animals,

222
00:17:20.500 --> 00:17:22.460
Find a warm place to sleep? Could they do that?

223
00:17:23.330 --> 00:17:26.910
If they've never had to ever before in life, they were born in a fucking living room

224
00:17:27.450 --> 00:17:31.060
And they spent their life in your bedroom having food fed to them,

225
00:17:31.670 --> 00:17:34.710
Having themselves cleaned by human beings. Could they really survive outside?

226
00:17:37.640 --> 00:17:41.450
I don't know. I think cats could. Cats are very, very intelligent animals.

227
00:17:43.570 --> 00:17:47.170
I'm sure a cat could survive. Cats are fucking gangsters. But dogs?

228
00:17:47.290 --> 00:17:52.620
I don't know. I feel like a dog would get itself into trouble. You know?

229
00:17:53.970 --> 00:17:57.890
Just thinking about the U.S., I guess. But yeah, it's kind of strange, right?

230
00:17:58.000 --> 00:17:59.570
The idea like, you're going to take this animal.

231
00:17:59.830 --> 00:18:02.660
You're going to pay for it, first of all, like a slave.

232
00:18:02.660 --> 00:18:05.590
You're going to pay $700 for this pit bull.

233
00:18:07.110 --> 00:18:12.940
How the fuck do you put a price on an animal's life? Who decides what the price is? You know?

234
00:18:12.940 --> 00:18:19.690
It's like you would never sell a kid, but a dog totally fine. Sell it. Fuck it, you know?

235
00:18:21.430 --> 00:18:26.540
So you pay 700 bucks for this pit bull. You bring it home and you say, I'm your master.

236
00:18:27.560 --> 00:18:30.590
You sit when I tell you to sit. You shit when I tell you to shit.

237
00:18:30.960 --> 00:18:35.550
You eat when I tell you to eat. You sleep where I tell you to sleep, motherfucker.

238
00:18:38.330 --> 00:18:41.400
And you let me rub my hands all over you with no permission.

239
00:18:41.720 --> 00:18:46.470
I don't remember where I heard that, but I never realized it until that moment.

240
00:18:46.470 --> 00:18:49.490
I was watching a video or something like that, and this guy was like,

241
00:18:49.490 --> 00:18:55.860
Have you noticed that it's totally normal to fucking molest animals without their permission?

242
00:18:57.780 --> 00:19:00.870
Maybe you don't know what molest means. And to be honest,

243
00:19:01.240 --> 00:19:03.610
I don't have a definition for you, so I'm going to find it really quick.

244
00:19:04.930 --> 00:19:13.420
Molest definition. To assault or abuse a person, especially a woman or a child sexually.

245
00:19:16.300 --> 00:19:19.740
Yeah. Basically, yeah. That's what it means to molest.

246
00:19:20.420 --> 00:19:25.320
So imagine a fucking dog that cannot speak. And especially strangers, right?

247
00:19:25.810 --> 00:19:28.710
Strangers will just walk up to somebody's dog, "Oh, he's so cute".

248
00:19:28.710 --> 00:19:30.770
And start petting the dog, rubbing their hands all over it.

249
00:19:31.320 --> 00:19:36.370
And the dog has no choice. It's like, Yeah, I guess fucking touch me, stranger.

250
00:19:37.340 --> 00:19:39.550
You know what I'm saying? It's weird.

251
00:19:41.580 --> 00:19:44.160
And of course, a dog lover would be like, "No, obviously he loves it.

252
00:19:44.160 --> 00:19:47.280
His tail's wagging and he's coming closer to me" and shit like that.

253
00:19:47.280 --> 00:19:53.580
It's like, Yeah, but you don't know what the dog's thinking. Right? You don't really know.

254
00:19:55.930 --> 00:20:01.270
Just like on those nature shows where they tell you all the whales swim in this direction

255
00:20:01.300 --> 00:20:03.440
And they do this movement because of this. It's like,

256
00:20:03.440 --> 00:20:07.220
How the fuck do you know? Did you talk to the whale? Did it tell you that?

257
00:20:09.370 --> 00:20:17.300
I doubt it. I highly doubt it. So how do they know these things? You know?

258
00:20:20.770 --> 00:20:24.560
Anyway, I just think it's kind of weird the idea of keeping a pet.

259
00:20:27.120 --> 00:20:30.520
I think people love animals and they want to treat animals well.

260
00:20:31.590 --> 00:20:34.010
And I like the idea of having... it's strange but I like it.

261
00:20:34.010 --> 00:20:38.240
Like, I want some dogs. I want a couple of cats. I love animals.

262
00:20:38.480 --> 00:20:48.950
It'd be nice to have them as pets, you know? But at the same time, it's just a weird idea.

263
00:20:50.890 --> 00:20:56.380
I don't know. It's just a weird idea to keep animals in your house.

264
00:20:58.220 --> 00:21:02.090
Like somewhere in between your child and a slave is what a pet is.

265
00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:06.970
Maybe that's like a really sinister way of looking at it.

266
00:21:08.150 --> 00:21:09.560
Because I understand the positives, right?

267
00:21:09.560 --> 00:21:12.730
Some people are lonely and the pets keep them company.

268
00:21:12.830 --> 00:21:20.400
Other people are very anxious and having a pet near them helps them with their anxiety, for example.

269
00:21:20.630 --> 00:21:23.630
Other people are blind and they need a dog to lead them around and stuff like that.

270
00:21:23.720 --> 00:21:27.130
I understand the utility of having a pet.

271
00:21:27.960 --> 00:21:32.500
There are many reasons that one could have a pet. But still, just repla...

272
00:21:32.770 --> 00:21:37.700
Imagine if it weren't an animal and it were just a small human being and you treated it like a pet.

273
00:21:37.700 --> 00:21:42.030
Imagine that. A little human being that you bought.

274
00:21:42.250 --> 00:21:44.030
I don't know how it works in other countries, but here,

275
00:21:44.350 --> 00:21:49.050
Depending on where you go it's a normal thing to pull into a grocery store parking lot

276
00:21:50.060 --> 00:21:54.370
And somebody is out there with a van and they have the back of their van opened

277
00:21:54.370 --> 00:21:58.340
And there's a box inside full of baby puppies or kittens or something like that.

278
00:21:58.340 --> 00:22:03.000
And they got a big sign on their car that says "Puppies for sale". A normal thing.

279
00:22:05.150 --> 00:22:06.930
Imagine that, you're pulling up to the grocery store.

280
00:22:06.980 --> 00:22:11.350
You see a car over there by itself in the parking lot, it says "Puppies for sale".

281
00:22:11.370 --> 00:22:15.390
You can walk over there, give that person $300 and you'll have a baby puppy.

282
00:22:15.390 --> 00:22:17.110
You just take it home. Do whatever you want. Fuck it.

283
00:22:19.320 --> 00:22:24.720
Imagine if those were small people. You drive up to that same grocery store.

284
00:22:25.800 --> 00:22:28.260
The car's over there, it says "Small people for sale".

285
00:22:29.530 --> 00:22:33.100
You walk over there, you pay $300 for a small human being. Do whatever you want.

286
00:22:33.100 --> 00:22:36.300
Fuck it. Take it home, feed it, clothe it.

287
00:22:37.020 --> 00:22:40.230
That's another weird, weird, weird, weird thing to me, bro.

288
00:22:40.780 --> 00:22:43.260
I don't know if you guys do this in your country, but in the U.S,

289
00:22:43.860 --> 00:22:46.370
Not everyone, it's a question of culture and class,

290
00:22:46.430 --> 00:22:53.580
But some people here have made the habit of putting clothing on their animals, especially dogs.

291
00:22:55.060 --> 00:22:57.990
It'll be Christmas time, so they'll put a Christmas sweater on their dog

292
00:22:58.280 --> 00:23:01.870
And a Santa Claus hat and maybe some boots or something like that.

293
00:23:01.870 --> 00:23:05.060
And it's so cute. It's so... It's adorable.

294
00:23:06.500 --> 00:23:13.360
And maybe I'm like, just way too cynical or skeptical.

295
00:23:13.360 --> 00:23:16.460
I don't know the word I'm looking for, but maybe I'm just too negative on this subject.

296
00:23:16.460 --> 00:23:20.140
But that is fucking weird. That's not cute to me. That's humiliating.

297
00:23:22.580 --> 00:23:25.550
To dress up an animal like a little elf or a Santa Claus.

298
00:23:25.770 --> 00:23:27.990
You know what I'm saying? Like, that's humiliating.

299
00:23:30.330 --> 00:23:33.770
Like, imagine if you were eight or nine years old, especially if you're a boy,

300
00:23:34.060 --> 00:23:36.610
You're a little boy, nine years old. And your parents say,

301
00:23:36.610 --> 00:23:40.010
Oh, it would be so cute if we put a little tutu on you, a little skirt

302
00:23:40.550 --> 00:23:43.520
And a Santa Claus hat and some boots and some stockings.

303
00:23:43.700 --> 00:23:49.020
Wouldn't that be cute? And you had no choice. You couldn't even say, "No, I don't want to".

304
00:23:49.020 --> 00:23:51.600
They just put the clothes on you and make you walk around like that.

305
00:23:52.240 --> 00:23:55.510
Imagine that. It's fucking humiliating.

306
00:24:00.770 --> 00:24:05.270
Who told you, who told you that the dog was fine wearing these, like, ridiculous clothes?

307
00:24:05.880 --> 00:24:08.530
Who gave you the idea to put clothes on a fucking dog?

308
00:24:09.580 --> 00:24:13.350
That's my question. Humiliating, bro.

309
00:24:14.010 --> 00:24:15.920
The dog has no say in the matter. He has no choice.

310
00:24:17.860 --> 00:24:23.020
And again, I just ask you to put a human being in that same situation and ask yourself,

311
00:24:23.070 --> 00:24:27.380
Is that right? Would that be okay? Put yourself in that situation.

312
00:24:27.380 --> 00:24:29.700
Would you be okay with that? You know what I'm saying?

313
00:24:29.700 --> 00:24:34.310
That's the way I think about it. Because animals can't talk, bro. We have no idea.

314
00:24:36.290 --> 00:24:39.760
And a lot of people's argument like I said is, Well, the animal hasn't run away,

315
00:24:40.240 --> 00:24:42.820
So he must be okay with it. The animal isn't complaining,

316
00:24:42.820 --> 00:24:46.110
So he must be okay with it. But you've got to remember, bro,

317
00:24:46.240 --> 00:24:49.450
Like a slave born in captivity, sometimes doesn't know he's a slave

318
00:24:49.450 --> 00:24:51.710
And doesn't know that there's life outside of captivity.

319
00:24:51.710 --> 00:24:54.960
So just because they're not complaining or saying anything about it doesn't make it right.

320
00:24:54.960 --> 00:24:58.050
It doesn't mean they're okay with it. They just don't know anything else.

321
00:24:59.720 --> 00:25:01.650
They know whatever you tell it, whatever you show it,

322
00:25:01.860 --> 00:25:04.400
Especially if it was born in captivity like I said.

323
00:25:04.400 --> 00:25:10.470
Of course, animals have certain instincts. But, you know, my point is the same.

324
00:25:12.490 --> 00:25:17.320
So, I don't know. It's just something weird, like even not just cats and dogs, but fish.

325
00:25:18.170 --> 00:25:24.670
They take a fish out of its natural habitat and put it in like a four by two-foot tank and say,

326
00:25:24.670 --> 00:25:30.250
"This is your world now. You may not go beyond these four pieces of glass. Have fun".

327
00:25:31.120 --> 00:25:34.120
It's fucking weird. That's weird.

328
00:25:35.030 --> 00:25:38.450
And we're totally okay with just locking up animals because they're animals and,

329
00:25:38.450 --> 00:25:43.390
Well, I feed it and keep its home clean. At least it's not out there in the wild.

330
00:25:43.720 --> 00:25:48.070
I rescued it and I saved it. I think that's bullshit.

331
00:25:48.070 --> 00:25:52.600
And I'm not against having pets, bro. Like I said, I want a couple of dogs and cats. You know?

332
00:25:52.600 --> 00:25:54.390
I'm not against it. I just think it's weird.

333
00:25:55.780 --> 00:26:00.670
I just think it's one of those weird things that when you really stop and think about it, it's unjustifiable.

334
00:26:00.950 --> 00:26:04.880
But we do it anyway. There's a lot of things like that,

335
00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:09.430
And having pets is one of them. I would love to know what you think about this.

336
00:26:09.470 --> 00:26:14.450
And again, I love animals, bro. I would love to have some pets. I'm not against it, you know.

337
00:26:14.490 --> 00:26:20.520
I'm not judging anyone. I'm just saying, it's weird. What do you think?

338
00:26:25.320 --> 00:26:27.900
Even the zoo, it makes... It's kind of similar, right?

339
00:26:28.080 --> 00:26:34.970
The zoo is just like a giant place for these animal slaves. You know?

340
00:26:36.010 --> 00:26:41.230
It's really what it is. It's a giant prison. I remember I was in San Diego, California, bro.

341
00:26:42.170 --> 00:26:48.360
San Diego, California, and two of my aunts had come down from up north.

342
00:26:49.380 --> 00:26:52.840
Where were they? Not up north, but they were like in the Orange County area,

343
00:26:52.840 --> 00:26:55.020
Which is close to LA, they lived a couple of hours away.

344
00:26:55.920 --> 00:27:04.490
So they came down to visit me and we went to the zoo and we're just driving through the zoo,

345
00:27:04.590 --> 00:27:08.920
Like not driving through. But it was a really, really, really big zoo and

346
00:27:08.920 --> 00:27:11.600
You could go on this kind of like mini safari.

347
00:27:11.830 --> 00:27:16.400
They would put you in a truck and take you through this artificial desert land

348
00:27:16.400 --> 00:27:18.460
That was supposed to represent like, the African desert.

349
00:27:18.800 --> 00:27:24.100
And there were literally giraffes walking around San Diego, California, bro.

350
00:27:25.730 --> 00:27:33.000
What does that mean? Somebody captured the fucking giraffe and transported it to San Diego, California.

351
00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:39.250
How do you transport a giraffe? How do you transport a giraffe, bro?

352
00:27:40.880 --> 00:27:44.710
I don't know. That's... I'll never forget that. It was the strangest thing.

353
00:27:44.710 --> 00:27:47.700
I'm like, Bro, we are in San Diego. How the fuck did this thing get here?

354
00:27:47.700 --> 00:27:52.530
We don't have giraffes in this country. I don't think we have giraffes on this continent.

355
00:27:52.530 --> 00:27:53.240
Like, what the fuck?

356
00:27:56.550 --> 00:27:59.250
But somebody somewhere captured that fucking animal.

357
00:27:59.860 --> 00:28:06.810
Or even worse, captured the baby of an adult giraffe and transported it to the United States of America,

358
00:28:06.810 --> 00:28:12.650
San Diego, California, and locked it up. And said, This is where you live now.

359
00:28:13.580 --> 00:28:19.250
New climate, new area, new environment. Something that you're not used to or prepared for,

360
00:28:19.250 --> 00:28:24.640
We're going to make this your home. Welcome. You're welcome, motherfucker.

361
00:28:24.640 --> 00:28:28.950
I rescued you from a life of suffering out there in the desert,

362
00:28:28.950 --> 00:28:30.280
Even though that's where you're supposed to be.

363
00:28:32.690 --> 00:28:40.350
It's weird, bro. Fucking weird to go to SeaWorld and see a giant whale in a swimming pool.

364
00:28:42.270 --> 00:28:50.880
That's weird. That's weird, bro. How people are like, are okay with that is beyond me.

365
00:28:51.330 --> 00:28:55.160
Imagine if that was a human being. Even if it wasn't a human being, just the animal itself.

366
00:28:55.160 --> 00:29:02.090
You decided to play God, apparently, you're Jesus Christ the savior and you saved this whale.

367
00:29:03.750 --> 00:29:06.230
And by keeping it here in captivity, you're saving its life.

368
00:29:06.290 --> 00:29:13.060
That's what you think. That's your rationale. I don't understand it.

369
00:29:13.230 --> 00:29:18.150
I think that's completely wrong. I think that is so wrong, bro. It's so inhumane.

370
00:29:19.590 --> 00:29:24.320
They just lock animals up like that. And not only lock them up in an artificial habitat

371
00:29:24.570 --> 00:29:26.650
But then charge people money to come see them.

372
00:29:29.370 --> 00:29:32.850
You got a fucking killer whale performing like a ballerina,

373
00:29:32.850 --> 00:29:42.020
And you're charging people money to see it. How is that morally acceptable, bro?

374
00:29:42.150 --> 00:29:47.220
Like, for years now, decades, SeaWorld has been getting away with that shit, just whatever.

375
00:29:48.430 --> 00:29:50.350
Capture these animals, keep them in captivity,

376
00:29:51.960 --> 00:29:55.960
Take away their killer instinct and make them perform for humans. That's fucking insane.

377
00:29:55.960 --> 00:30:03.500
Gorillas behind a glass wall. In a fucking, you know, 25 square meter room.

378
00:30:04.640 --> 00:30:10.940
No windows. This is your home now. That is fucking crazy.

379
00:30:12.490 --> 00:30:23.780
That is fucking crazy to me. I don't know, bro. It's weird. It's really weird.

380
00:30:29.910 --> 00:30:36.870
Anyway. Let me take a sip of my Red Bull. I don't know about y'all.

381
00:30:36.870 --> 00:30:40.560
I like drinking coffee in the morning, but not because I need the caffeine

382
00:30:40.560 --> 00:30:43.840
And it's going to wake me up that way because I don't know what's wrong with me,

383
00:30:43.930 --> 00:30:47.690
But the amount of caffeine and your typical cup of coffee is not enough for me.

384
00:30:48.520 --> 00:30:53.420
Caffeine doesn't wake me up in the morning. Like, a lot of people will say,

385
00:30:53.420 --> 00:30:56.140
Oh, I can't even begin to function without my cup of joe.

386
00:30:56.210 --> 00:31:00.890
I just got to have my cup of coffee in the morning so I can get my energy for the day.

387
00:31:01.940 --> 00:31:04.980
But that's not me. I just drink it because it tastes pretty good.

388
00:31:05.120 --> 00:31:09.430
But if I need energy in the morning or any time I got to drink a Red Bull.

389
00:31:10.540 --> 00:31:12.100
Whatever's in Red Bull, that shit works.

390
00:31:13.870 --> 00:31:18.080
Because I get energized from Red Bull. But coffee, no.

391
00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:22.570
So anyway, let me take a sip of my Red Bull.

392
00:31:22.870 --> 00:31:25.780
They recently came out with some new flavors, too. They got tropical.

393
00:31:25.780 --> 00:31:32.050
They got watermelon, blueberry, peach nectar. There's some other ones.

394
00:31:32.100 --> 00:31:43.730
Coconut. That one's really good. So, yeah, I fucks with Red Bull. Heavy. Yeah, man.

395
00:31:45.430 --> 00:31:50.760
Another thing that was on my mind recently is that there are so many things,

396
00:31:50.760 --> 00:31:55.080
So many videos, so many subjects that I've been wanting to talk about on the podcast,

397
00:31:55.960 --> 00:31:59.270
And just not enough time to do it all. You know?

398
00:31:59.680 --> 00:32:02.930
Because I get inspiration from everywhere, from music, movies, TV series,

399
00:32:02.930 --> 00:32:08.650
Conversations, TikTok videos, all types of stuff. Paintings, poems, podcasts.

400
00:32:09.080 --> 00:32:13.390
All of these things can be used as inspiration when I'm trying to make a podcast episode.

401
00:32:14.740 --> 00:32:19.750
And I see or hear all these different subjects that would be really interesting

402
00:32:19.750 --> 00:32:22.510
To think about and talk about and make podcast episodes about.

403
00:32:23.630 --> 00:32:26.650
But to take the time to sit down and prepare each one would take so long,

404
00:32:26.650 --> 00:32:33.690
And I got so much stuff to do. So I got like, hundreds, hundreds of videos saved on my TikTok profile

405
00:32:33.690 --> 00:32:36.870
That I want to use as material in the podcast in the future.

406
00:32:36.870 --> 00:32:43.360
And I was just like, Man, when am I going to have the time to go deeply into all these subjects?

407
00:32:43.360 --> 00:32:45.580
I just don't have the time. This kind of sucks.

408
00:32:46.560 --> 00:32:49.670
It kind of goes back to a podcast episode I did a couple of months ago.

409
00:32:50.400 --> 00:32:52.760
I don't remember what number it was, but it was something like

410
00:32:53.810 --> 00:32:57.510
"The best and worst part of the digital age" or something like that.

411
00:32:57.510 --> 00:33:00.520
I can't remember the title, but I was talking about that specifically.

412
00:33:00.520 --> 00:33:02.790
It's just like, so much content, so little time.

413
00:33:02.860 --> 00:33:09.230
There will be movies and paintings and podcasts and TV shows that we'll never know about

414
00:33:09.230 --> 00:33:13.910
Or consume just because we don't have the time. We have to live life, too.

415
00:33:13.910 --> 00:33:20.650
And you know what's crazy is last night I found myself on YouTube trying to find something to watch.

416
00:33:21.020 --> 00:33:24.870
And there were probably billions, hundreds of millions,

417
00:33:24.870 --> 00:33:28.790
If not billions of videos to watch on YouTube and I'm sitting there just looking at the screen like,

418
00:33:28.790 --> 00:33:29.790
Damn, there's nothing to watch.

419
00:33:30.600 --> 00:33:34.890
I got over 200 videos in my watch later playlist and I'm still like,

420
00:33:34.890 --> 00:33:36.180
Ahh there's just nothing to watch.

421
00:33:36.180 --> 00:33:39.850
Like, I don't, you know, I saved that video a couple of months ago when I was interested

422
00:33:39.850 --> 00:33:43.700
And now I'm like, Ahh I'm good. Not right now. Later. Right?

423
00:33:44.110 --> 00:33:47.030
Everything you put in the 'later list' is just like 'never again list'.

424
00:33:47.030 --> 00:33:50.200
That's what they should call it. I'll never watch this list.

425
00:33:51.430 --> 00:33:56.790
Not the watch later list. But anyway, I was scrolling through that vist of... That vist?

426
00:33:58.170 --> 00:34:03.000
I was scrolling through that list of saved videos and I found one that was interesting

427
00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:07.140
That I want to share with you really quick because this concept can be applied

428
00:34:07.660 --> 00:34:10.120
To so many things but particularly to your English.

429
00:34:10.120 --> 00:34:14.440
I know that's what connects us here is me teaching English and you learning.

430
00:34:14.440 --> 00:34:15.910
But it's really life in general, man.

431
00:34:15.910 --> 00:34:20.280
So this clip that I saw is of a guy named Mr. Beast.

432
00:34:20.670 --> 00:34:24.530
I don't know his real name, but he's a really, really, really, really, really famous YouTuber.

433
00:34:24.530 --> 00:34:30.650
He might be one of the largest in terms of impact, following and,

434
00:34:30.980 --> 00:34:32.250
You know, money and all these types of things.

435
00:34:32.250 --> 00:34:35.470
He might be one of those bigger YouTubers with the biggest channels.

436
00:34:35.470 --> 00:34:41.840
And he was talking about how he got to where he is today, that level of success.

437
00:34:42.490 --> 00:34:44.580
You know, what he had to do. The mindset he had.

438
00:34:45.360 --> 00:34:46.640
So I'm going to share that clip now.

439
00:34:47.640 --> 00:34:51.060
Let him tell you himself and then we'll talk about it after that.

440
00:34:51.390 --> 00:34:52.830
All right? So let me get the video ready.

441
00:34:58.930 --> 00:35:00.130
And you live. It's just like...

442
00:35:01.080 --> 00:35:02.850
Oh. All right, here we go.

443
00:35:04.920 --> 00:35:08.080
If you wake up and every day you obsess over something and you live and breathe it,

444
00:35:08.080 --> 00:35:11.340
And that's what you think about. That's what you do. That's what you study on and off.

445
00:35:11.520 --> 00:35:16.440
That's what you stay up every night grinding and no one else even gives a flying fuck about it.

446
00:35:16.440 --> 00:35:19.750
It's like, you just feel like a weirdo, you know, like an outcast.

447
00:35:19.750 --> 00:35:22.340
And I was also, like, just dumb. Back then I didn't realize,

448
00:35:22.340 --> 00:35:23.830
Oh, well, I just need to find different people.

449
00:35:23.830 --> 00:35:27.760
I thought like, Oh, my whole life, I'll just never enjoy talking to people.

450
00:35:27.910 --> 00:35:31.640
And then I met other YouTubers and then I started talking to them like 10 hours a day,

451
00:35:31.640 --> 00:35:34.440
And I was like... Then that's when the channel really started taking off.

452
00:35:34.710 --> 00:35:37.430
How important was that for you to develop a community online of...

453
00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:38.490
Of fans?

454
00:35:38.490 --> 00:35:39.220
Of friends.

455
00:35:39.270 --> 00:35:40.910
Friends. Oh, beyond important.

456
00:35:40.910 --> 00:35:43.000
It's like, yeah, that's just where you just...

457
00:35:43.070 --> 00:35:46.360
So like, imagine a world where it's just you working solo

458
00:35:46.440 --> 00:35:50.320
And you work 12 hours a day every day for like a year. And you're just grinding.

459
00:35:50.320 --> 00:35:51.730
You make a mistake, you learn from it,

460
00:35:51.730 --> 00:35:55.160
You grind, you make (a mistake), you learn from it. And you do that for like a year.

461
00:35:55.160 --> 00:35:59.760
And then imagine a different world where you have four friends who are also equally grinding in something similar.

462
00:36:00.560 --> 00:36:03.500
Friend number one makes a mistake on Friday. He teaches the other four people.

463
00:36:03.500 --> 00:36:05.780
Friend number two makes a mistake the next week. Teaches everyone.

464
00:36:06.040 --> 00:36:08.190
And then, like you're all learning from each other's mistakes.

465
00:36:08.190 --> 00:36:11.390
You're all constantly studying 24/7 and downloading each other.

466
00:36:11.710 --> 00:36:15.810
Like after a year, you're like two years ahead of the guy who was just solo.

467
00:36:16.170 --> 00:36:19.780
It really does make a difference. Especially like, my friend group when I was like,

468
00:36:19.890 --> 00:36:22.330
I met a bunch of people when I had 10,000 subscribers and we all,

469
00:36:22.330 --> 00:36:26.360
Like, we agreed not to drink. We didn't do drugs. Like, we didn't date. We didn't do anything.

470
00:36:26.360 --> 00:36:29.880
We just literally obsessed from the time we woke up to the time we went to bed.

471
00:36:29.880 --> 00:36:32.260
That's literally all we did. It's wild.

472
00:36:32.260 --> 00:36:36.060
Like, I've told this story before. But for people who didn't listen to our other podcasts,

473
00:36:36.060 --> 00:36:40.100
Like one day I literally got up and we had an 18 hour Skype call

474
00:36:40.310 --> 00:36:42.020
And then I went to bed and that's all I did.

475
00:36:42.020 --> 00:36:45.750
And we were just tearing apart YouTube videos, studying trends and stuff like that.

476
00:36:45.750 --> 00:36:48.310
I don't even know how I got food. Like, pretty sure I was just ordering food

477
00:36:48.310 --> 00:36:50.470
So I didn't even have to leave my house so we could keep working.

478
00:36:50.470 --> 00:36:53.500
Like, it was that level of obsession. It was just dumb.

479
00:36:53.500 --> 00:36:55.160
It was so unhealthy. It's just...

480
00:36:57.990 --> 00:37:01.710
All right. So first of all, I didn't realize until now how fast he actually talks.

481
00:37:01.800 --> 00:37:04.000
So don't feel bad if you couldn't understand everything

482
00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:08.130
Because he was talking pretty fast and like, blending a lot of his words together.

483
00:37:08.130 --> 00:37:11.200
You can tell his mind moves really, really, really fast. You know?

484
00:37:12.200 --> 00:37:15.020
But also you have the transcript for this episode,

485
00:37:15.020 --> 00:37:18.910
So you can obviously go and read everything he said to make sure you truly understood.

486
00:37:19.880 --> 00:37:23.080
But now I just want to talk really quickly about the idea that he was expressing.

487
00:37:23.080 --> 00:37:27.600
Because, again, he was talking about how he got to such a level of success on YouTube,

488
00:37:28.290 --> 00:37:32.100
Millions of subscribers and views, and how he's making money doing this thing.

489
00:37:32.840 --> 00:37:36.430
And the key was just becoming obsessed with YouTube.

490
00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:42.600
Becoming obsessed with being successful on YouTube. Whatever that means to him, you know?

491
00:37:43.460 --> 00:37:48.300
Like, you have to eat, breathe and sleep this thing day in and day out,

492
00:37:48.370 --> 00:37:52.030
Day after day after day after day. And it's not just like,

493
00:37:52.030 --> 00:37:55.650
Oh, I'm going to work on this 30 minutes a day. I'm going to work on this an hour a day.

494
00:37:55.650 --> 00:38:02.590
It's like, Nah, I'm going to work on this 10 to 12 to 16 hours a day until I see results,

495
00:38:02.590 --> 00:38:05.680
Until I see a difference. And then when I start to see results and a difference,

496
00:38:05.970 --> 00:38:09.040
I'm just going to go even harder because it's clearly working. So why would I stop?

497
00:38:09.040 --> 00:38:14.670
Why would I slow down? It just has to become everything to you. Everything.

498
00:38:14.670 --> 00:38:19.020
And it's the same thing with any skill that you want to learn or anything you want to be successful at.

499
00:38:19.930 --> 00:38:23.170
You know, it's one of those things that you can't really teach somebody.

500
00:38:23.170 --> 00:38:27.020
It's just something that comes naturally, I think, is that part of obsession.

501
00:38:28.440 --> 00:38:30.910
To where you want this thing so bad, it's so important to you,

502
00:38:30.910 --> 00:38:34.820
The desire is burning so deeply in your soul to achieve this thing

503
00:38:34.890 --> 00:38:40.030
Or to have this thing or learn this thing that there is nothing on the planet earth

504
00:38:41.300 --> 00:38:43.620
That will stop you from getting it. That's obsession.

505
00:38:43.800 --> 00:38:46.810
You wake up thinking about it. You're at work, you're thinking about it.

506
00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:48.380
You're eating dinner, you're thinking about it.

507
00:38:48.380 --> 00:38:52.730
Before you go to bed, you're thinking about it. You're obsessed. You see what I'm saying?

508
00:38:53.680 --> 00:38:59.560
People who have that trait inside of them are people who can develop an obsession like that.

509
00:38:59.600 --> 00:39:02.620
Even, you know, some people might say it's not healthy and maybe it's not,

510
00:39:03.170 --> 00:39:07.630
But it's definitely effective. So if you can, you know, develop that mindset,

511
00:39:10.100 --> 00:39:13.360
I think you have a much higher chance of achieving whatever it is you want to achieve.

512
00:39:14.640 --> 00:39:18.270
You know what I'm saying? Because when it's just all you think about,

513
00:39:18.270 --> 00:39:22.160
When it's all you do all day, every day, there's no way you're not going to make progress.

514
00:39:22.160 --> 00:39:27.330
There's no way you're not going to learn more by constantly being in contact with this thing.

515
00:39:27.330 --> 00:39:31.460
Constantly trying to improve. You know, it just becomes a part of you in a way.

516
00:39:31.460 --> 00:39:35.210
It becomes just as normal as waking up and having a cup of coffee.

517
00:39:35.880 --> 00:39:38.830
You do that every single day. It's almost like you feel you need to do it.

518
00:39:38.830 --> 00:39:41.390
You just do it. And I think it's like that with any skill.

519
00:39:41.470 --> 00:39:45.220
After a while, it just becomes this thing you do. You know?

520
00:39:45.220 --> 00:39:51.500
And then Mr. Beast, he talked about the importance of having a community of friends

521
00:39:52.510 --> 00:39:54.890
Who are like-minded and have the same goals and objectives.

522
00:39:54.890 --> 00:40:00.300
He said that his channel really took off when he found other YouTubers doing the same things that he was trying to do.

523
00:40:01.120 --> 00:40:05.740
And that way, he had three or four peers that were on more or less the same level as him,

524
00:40:05.740 --> 00:40:09.460
And they're all trying to like, work hard and grind and learn and grow together.

525
00:40:10.010 --> 00:40:14.480
So you basically chop your time in half if you add a friend to the situation.

526
00:40:14.830 --> 00:40:17.340
You chop it into three pieces if you add another one.

527
00:40:17.340 --> 00:40:19.310
Chop it into four, if you add another one.

528
00:40:19.560 --> 00:40:20.810
Hopefully, you can understand what I'm saying.

529
00:40:21.120 --> 00:40:23.320
But if it's going to take you ten years to achieve this thing alone,

530
00:40:23.960 --> 00:40:26.770
If you've got three friends helping you, it'll be three times as fast

531
00:40:26.770 --> 00:40:29.060
Because they're going to make mistakes and you learn from their mistakes.

532
00:40:29.320 --> 00:40:30.960
You're going to make mistakes and they learn from yours.

533
00:40:30.960 --> 00:40:32.630
So you're all learning and growing much faster.

534
00:40:33.830 --> 00:40:36.160
Because you don't have to go through everything to learn everything.

535
00:40:36.160 --> 00:40:38.850
Your friends are going through things that you're not and vice versa.

536
00:40:39.800 --> 00:40:42.030
So you just get there faster and it's better when you have friends

537
00:40:42.030 --> 00:40:44.870
Because some days you're going to feel down and demotivated

538
00:40:44.870 --> 00:40:47.870
And your friends are there to kind of lift you back up and vice versa.

539
00:40:48.850 --> 00:40:52.420
So they're there for you on the good days and the bad days.

540
00:40:52.740 --> 00:40:55.600
You see what I'm saying? You learn from them. They learn from you.

541
00:40:56.610 --> 00:41:05.050
And you just... or I just can't stress enough the importance of community in trying to learn something,

542
00:41:05.050 --> 00:41:08.150
Build something, grow something. Like, there's a lot of stuff you can do by yourself.

543
00:41:09.140 --> 00:41:12.160
You can learn a language theoretically by yourself. You can start a business.

544
00:41:12.520 --> 00:41:15.210
You can do all types of stuff. Travel the world by yourself.

545
00:41:15.340 --> 00:41:21.320
But when you've got friends or peers, people who have been where you want to be

546
00:41:21.320 --> 00:41:25.220
Or people that are going in the same direction, people that have the same goals or values,

547
00:41:25.220 --> 00:41:28.630
And stuff like that, it's something that you can't put a price on.

548
00:41:30.050 --> 00:41:32.350
You really can't, which is why I talk so much about this community,

549
00:41:32.350 --> 00:41:34.200
Which is why I made the Life in English community,

550
00:41:34.200 --> 00:41:37.790
Because, you know, you're trying to learn English by yourself and you can do that.

551
00:41:38.970 --> 00:41:42.980
But it's going to take you so much longer than it would if you had people to learn and practice with.

552
00:41:42.980 --> 00:41:47.500
So in this community, you got myself obviously, but other people from around the world

553
00:41:47.990 --> 00:41:51.390
Who are like-minded with similar goals and we can all learn and grow together.

554
00:41:52.750 --> 00:41:55.940
They learn things and they share them with you. You learn things and you share them with them.

555
00:41:56.540 --> 00:41:59.170
You correct their mistakes. They correct yours. I'm correcting everyone.

556
00:41:59.170 --> 00:42:02.290
And the whole time we're just learning and growing together,

557
00:42:02.290 --> 00:42:05.230
Talking about a bunch of different subjects, philosophy, psychology,

558
00:42:05.230 --> 00:42:08.370
Health care, music, movies. Just talking about life.

559
00:42:09.480 --> 00:42:13.640
And the end result is that this whole time you're constantly in contact with the English language,

560
00:42:13.640 --> 00:42:16.460
But you're also making friends around the world, making connections,

561
00:42:16.790 --> 00:42:18.660
You're learning about much more than just language.

562
00:42:19.640 --> 00:42:24.560
So you get there much faster in a much more enjoyable way. You know?

563
00:42:26.220 --> 00:42:30.050
Because sticking with the context of learning a language it's not about English.

564
00:42:30.050 --> 00:42:34.520
I don't think any of us are just so obsessed or passionate about the language itself.

565
00:42:34.520 --> 00:42:38.710
Even if it is cool and you love it, it's really what you want to do with the language that matters.

566
00:42:39.770 --> 00:42:41.430
I think that's what the whole point is.

567
00:42:43.070 --> 00:42:45.790
I'm sure there are some people out there who just learn languages just because.

568
00:42:45.840 --> 00:42:50.190
But most of us learn a new language because we want to use it for something. Right?

569
00:42:52.070 --> 00:42:54.580
So in a community, you just end up using the language all the time

570
00:42:54.620 --> 00:42:56.760
And you stop thinking about the language.

571
00:42:57.350 --> 00:43:04.020
And I think that's the best way to learn a language. So I don't know, man.

572
00:43:04.020 --> 00:43:08.360
It was just an interesting clip because I think everything you said was 100% true.

573
00:43:09.640 --> 00:43:10.780
One thing that separates...

574
00:43:11.430 --> 00:43:18.660
One thing that separates the 1% from the 99% in terms of success is obsession, I think.

575
00:43:21.710 --> 00:43:23.920
When it just becomes your whole world, everything you think about,

576
00:43:23.920 --> 00:43:27.780
There's no way you're not going to get to where you want to go. There's no way.

577
00:43:27.780 --> 00:43:32.140
Because what you think about becomes what you do and what you do becomes what you experience.

578
00:43:32.140 --> 00:43:37.370
So if you're constantly thinking about achieving this goal, it has 100% of your focus,

579
00:43:37.420 --> 00:43:42.560
You're going to start to manifest whatever that is in your reality. Just naturally. Naturally.

580
00:43:43.560 --> 00:43:48.140
So... and you're going to get that much faster and have a lot more fun

581
00:43:48.160 --> 00:43:51.850
If you can find other friends that have the similar goals, similar mindset.

582
00:43:51.850 --> 00:43:55.380
So you guys can push each other forward and help each other. You know?

583
00:43:55.670 --> 00:43:59.990
There's nothing better. So you can do it alone, but you don't have to.

584
00:43:59.990 --> 00:44:04.720
And in most cases, you probably shouldn't. You know what I'm saying?

585
00:44:05.330 --> 00:44:08.910
And of course, I'm generalizing here. It depends on the situation, the context, the person.

586
00:44:08.910 --> 00:44:23.650
But I'm sure you get the point. You know? How long we've been here?

587
00:44:23.650 --> 00:44:31.080
Man, that was a quick 45, man. That was a quick 45.

588
00:44:31.080 --> 00:44:32.530
But listen, man, I'm going to get out of here.

589
00:44:32.530 --> 00:44:36.270
Like I said, I just wanted to come through, talk about nothing with you for a little bit.

590
00:44:37.190 --> 00:44:45.050
And I guess that's it, man. I definitely got some new podcast episodes coming soon.

591
00:44:45.670 --> 00:44:51.000
A little more... What's the word? Organized episodes with particular subjects

592
00:44:51.000 --> 00:44:55.050
And a particular goal we're trying to achieve and shit like that. But yeah.

593
00:44:55.050 --> 00:44:58.250
On the Coffee with Kaizen just wanted to come and talk about nothing with you, man.

594
00:44:59.100 --> 00:45:02.980
So that's number 33 in the books. I hope you enjoyed the episode.

595
00:45:03.750 --> 00:45:08.030
Also, one more thing before I go. If you're still here with me at this point,

596
00:45:09.050 --> 00:45:13.250
I just want to remind you and encourage you to get involved in the community.

597
00:45:13.990 --> 00:45:19.220
It's cool to listen to these episodes, to read the transcripts, to do the writing prompts.

598
00:45:19.220 --> 00:45:22.410
Hopefully, you're doing all that stuff, but it's also really important

599
00:45:22.410 --> 00:45:27.730
That you remember that you've got to use the language that you're learning and being exposed to.

600
00:45:28.090 --> 00:45:30.770
So don't be afraid to get in the community and start conversations,

601
00:45:31.030 --> 00:45:34.430
Send people messages, you know, start voice calls and things like that.

602
00:45:35.200 --> 00:45:36.530
Interact, man. Don't be afraid.

603
00:45:37.950 --> 00:45:40.560
I know most people are shy when they first join the community

604
00:45:40.560 --> 00:45:44.430
Or don't know how to approach strangers and things like that. I get that 100%.

605
00:45:45.050 --> 00:45:48.630
But I'm just saying, man, the community is only as good as its members

606
00:45:49.150 --> 00:45:51.470
And I'm working really hard to attract new and better members.

607
00:45:51.520 --> 00:45:54.370
But for you and all the others that are currently in the group,

608
00:45:54.900 --> 00:45:58.970
I think to make the community better, we have to be better. You know?

609
00:45:59.620 --> 00:46:04.990
So, anyway, I just wanted to give you that reminder and that encouragement to get on there

610
00:46:04.990 --> 00:46:06.590
And start talking to people man. Send me a me...

611
00:46:06.590 --> 00:46:09.630
Don't be afraid to send me a message either, you know. Hit me up.

612
00:46:09.630 --> 00:46:11.960
Start some conversations. I love it, bro.

613
00:46:13.010 --> 00:46:19.420
Exchanging ideas and helping you guys learn and grow and practice is the whole point of this podcast,

614
00:46:19.420 --> 00:46:21.250
This community, and everything I'm doing. You know?

615
00:46:23.740 --> 00:46:26.800
So yeah, just a little bit of... What's today, Saturday?

616
00:46:26.800 --> 00:46:29.350
A little bit of Saturday morning encouragement for you.

617
00:46:29.350 --> 00:46:31.400
I don't know when this episode is going to be released,

618
00:46:32.570 --> 00:46:38.630
But it's Saturday morning right now and I just felt the need to encourage you a little bit.

619
00:46:38.630 --> 00:46:40.970
So hopefully you take that to heart, my friend.

620
00:46:41.230 --> 00:46:45.080
But now that was, that is, I don't know.

621
00:46:45.920 --> 00:46:50.240
That is Coffee with Kaizen number 33 in the books.

622
00:46:50.240 --> 00:46:53.230
I hope you enjoyed the episode and I will definitely talk to you soon.

623
00:46:53.950 --> 00:46:54.460
Peace!

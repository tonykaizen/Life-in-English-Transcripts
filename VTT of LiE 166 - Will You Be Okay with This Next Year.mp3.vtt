What's up, my friend? You are listening to another episode
of Life in English. I'm your host, Tony Kaizen, and the

2
00:00:06.820 --> 00:00:15.220
question I've got for you today is: will you be okay with
the same thing next year? I

3
00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:24.330
want you to close your eyes for a moment. That's right. I
don't care what you're doing right now. I don't care where

4
00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:31.830
you are. Just stop and close your eyes for a moment, unless
you are driving a car, obviously. But I want you to think

5
00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:38.130
about where you are right now. Are you at work? Are you at
school?

6
00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:48.580
Are you on the train? Are you at home washing the dishes?
What city are you in? What country? How much money do you

7
00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:56.250
make? How are your relationships with the people closest to
you? How are your physical and mental health? What about

8
00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:04.560
your communication skills? What do you spend most of your
time doing? Take stock of exactly where you are in life

9
00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:14.260
right now. Would you be satisfied with yourself and your
life

10
00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:24.380
if you were in the same exact place one year from now? If
you said yes, then there's no need to

11
00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:31.440
keep listening to this episode. I'll talk to you in the next
one. But if you said, "hell no!", then you've got to wake up

12
00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:37.900
and realize that's exactly where you're going to be if you
don't start thinking and doing things differently. You're

13
00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:45.610
exactly where you are right now because of each and every
one of the choices you've made over the past year. There's

14
00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:51.970
no such thing as a big or small decision. There's no such
thing as a trivial decision. Every single one of them

15
00:01:51.970 --> 00:02:00.310
creates the future we will eventually experience. If a man
smoked a pack of cigarettes everyday for the next year, what

16
00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:08.280
would happen? It's safe to say his health would suffer,
right? If a woman ate well and went to the gym consistently

17
00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:18.260
for the next year, what would happen? Her mind, body, and
spirit would undoubtedly benefit from that, right? If you

18
00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:25.870
practice your English with real people everyday for the next
year, what would happen? I think you and I both know the

19
00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:34.040
answer to that question. So I ask you again: would you be
satisfied with yourself and your life if you were in the

20
00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:42.240
same exact place one year from now? If not, then I suggest
you get to work.

21
00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:44.150
Peace!

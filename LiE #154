00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:08.290
Is it okay to use the word "nigga"? This is a question I get
all the time. I also meet a lot of people that are afraid to

2
00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:14.300
say the word "black" when referring to Americans that look
like me. So let me clear up the confusion for you guys. But

3
00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:22.960
first, the word "nigga", n-i-g-g-a, this word comes from the
word "nigger", n-i-g-g-e-r, which is a racist slur, used to

4
00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:28.880
degrade black people. And just so you know, the word
"nigger" and "nigga", like, they're the same word. It's just

5
00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:35.490
these days, we say "nigga", right? And the word "nigga" is
used by some black people as a casual expression or a term

6
00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:41.420
of endearment and even an insult. It just depends on the
context. Now, notice that I said the word is used by "some"

7
00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:47.290
black people. It's not used by all black people. Some black
people hate that word. They never use it. They don't like

8
00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:52.650
when other black people use it, you know? So it just depends
on the person. It's not everyone. Now, thanks to hip-hop

9
00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:58.540
music, a lot of people think this word is cool and you know,
they think it's sexy and they want to use it all the time.

10
00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:05.660
And that's fine, bro. You can say whatever you want, but you
need to understand that if you're not a black American and

11
00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:11.510
you use this word around black Americans, you can find
yourself in a complicated and possibly dangerous situation

12
00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:18.270
because many black people find this word extremely offensive
when the person who's using it is not black. So my

13
00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:25.000
recommendation is that you do not use this word. Ever. Now,
the word "black".

14
00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:31.900
This word is used simply to describe Americans that look
like me, Americans who are descendants of the African slaves

15
00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:39.330
who were brought over here hundreds of years ago. Now, I'm
not sure when or why, but these days, some people, not black

16
00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:46.240
people, but some people consider the word black to be racist
and offensive. But in my humble opinion, it's not racist at

17
00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:52.650
all. I mean, we call most people of European descent "white"
because of their skin color. So I don't know when it became

18
00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:59.370
racist to call people of African descent "black". Honestly,
I think this is just identity politics. People trying to

19
00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:06.300
control the words you use in order to create the illusion of
progress and equality. Now, some people say that

20
00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:12.410
"African-American" is a more correct term to use when
referring to black people. But I am not an African-American.

21
00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:20.400
My parents are not from Africa. My grandparents are not from
Africa. My great grandparents are not from Africa. I have

22
00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:27.580
nothing in common with African people, and not all Africans
are black. So if you ask me if you want to refer to

23
00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:33.900
Americans that look like me, you can refer to us as black
people the same way you refer to people who look like Joe

24
00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:40.050
Biden or, you know, the cast of Friends or something like
that. You refer to people like that as white people without

25
00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:45.810
thinking twice about it, right? So there's nothing wrong
with calling me a black man. I am a black man. I'm really

26
00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:50.980
not black. None of us are black, white, brown, yellow or
red. It's all bullshit. But we use these words to describe

27
00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:56.700
reality. We need these words to describe things, right? So
it's just the way it is. It's just the way it is, right?

28
00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:03.810
Now, the word "African-American". This word is also fine.
You will hear black people use it. You'll hear people of all

29
00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:10.360
ethnic backgrounds use that word. And it's totally fine,
too. But if I were you, I would never use the word "nigga"

30
00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:14.090
with anyone. There is no reason for you to use that word.

00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:03.400
What's up, everybody? You are listening to another episode of Life in English.

2
00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:07.460
I'm your host Tony Kaizen. And in this episode,

3
00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:11.820
I'm going to be talking about the pros and the cons of teaching English on Italki.

4
00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:16.690
Let's do it.

5
00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:20.790
All right. Back in 2018,

6
00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:24.540
I had a YouTube channel on which I taught Brazilians how to speak English.

7
00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:30.200
Eventually, one of my subscribers asked me if I gave private classes online, and before that moment,

8
00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:35.360
I had never even considered the possibility of teaching one on one classes, much less online.

9
00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:41.210
I mean, I just wanted to get paid to make cool YouTube videos. But after doing some research,

10
00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:45.660
I figured it could be a pretty good opportunity to grow as a teacher and get paid while doing it.

11
00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:48.930
So I signed up for Italki and started giving online classes.

12
00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:52.060
And after about two years on the platform, I gained the knowledge

13
00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:55.790
And experience that I needed to create my own language education platform

14
00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:58.760
And teach English in a more interesting and effective way.

15
00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:03.170
So in this episode, I'm going to talk about my experience teaching English on Italki

16
00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:06.320
And the pros and cons of working on the platform.

17
00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:10.100
So let's start with the pros, the positives,

18
00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:13.950
The good things about teaching English on Italki or any language, let's say.

19
00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:17.190
Number one, and these are in no particular order, by the way.

20
00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:21.940
So, number one, there's an abundance of students on Italki.

21
00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:26.490
So Italki is a great option for teachers who don't have the time, money,

22
00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:29.070
or experience to market themselves online.

23
00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:33.860
And since Italki is essentially an online international marketplace,

24
00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:38.740
that means that there are people on that website every day looking to buy what you're selling.

25
00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:41.810
It's like opening a store inside a shopping mall.

26
00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:45.880
All day, everyday people are walking by your store,

27
00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:48.630
And that means you're constantly exposed to potential customers.

28
00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:54.860
So if you teach a language that's in demand and you have a nice profile and your hourly rates are competitive,

29
00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.730
You'll inevitably start getting students who want to learn from you.

30
00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:06.280
The second pro or benefit or good thing about teaching on Italki is that you choose your own hourly rate.

31
00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:11.180
You choose how much money you make. Because unlike working for traditional language schools,

32
00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:16.540
You get to decide how much you make per hour or per week or per month or whatever it is.

33
00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:22.820
You decide that. Now, of course, you've got to price yourself according to the market,

34
00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:31.070
But at least you get to make the final decision on how much money you will make in compensation for your work.

35
00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:35.700
You know what I'm saying? Because if you're working for a school or some other company,

36
00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:41.240
It doesn't matter how good you are, how experienced you are, like... Or nothing else matters.

37
00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:44.170
They decide this is your salary and that's just what it is.

38
00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:48.340
But when you work for yourself as an independent teacher on Italki, you get to choose.

39
00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:53.060
You want to make $10, 15, $50 an hour. It's up to you, you know?

40
00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:59.200
Which takes me to the next pro or benefit of teaching on Italki, which is you get to set your own schedule.

41
00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:08.020
Now, back in 2019, I took a three-month trip to Brazil and I was able to continue making money while I was there,

42
00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:13.670
Thanks to Italki and my own website. And since I could set my own schedule,

43
00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:20.130
I decided that I would work from Monday to Wednesday and I'd do whatever I wanted from Thursday to Sunday. Right?

44
00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:25.060
Now, of course, this change in schedule didn't work for some of my students that I already had.

45
00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:28.300
But most of them understood and they adapted to my new schedule.

46
00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:32.580
And my priority was being able to enjoy my time in Brazil.

47
00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:38.210
So I was fine losing a few students temporarily because I knew it wouldn't affect my long-term goals either way.

48
00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:42.180
And due to that abundance of potential students I mentioned earlier,

49
00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:46.410
I knew that I'd continue to receive new students if I just kept getting good reviews.

50
00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:49.180
I'll talk more about the review system in a little bit.

51
00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:54.960
Now, another pro of teaching or Italki is that you don't necessarily have to have a degree

52
00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:57.170
Or certification to teach on their platform.

53
00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:01.040
Now, this one is seen as a positive and a negative, depending on who you ask.

54
00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:04.240
Because on Italki you can be one of two kinds of teachers.

55
00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:08.380
The first one, a professional teacher. That's the title that they give you.

56
00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:14.110
And for that, you would need to have a degree or some special certification like the TEFL or TESOL, or something like that.

57
00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:18.030
Or you can be a community tutor,

58
00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:24.780
Which is essentially a native speaker who's willing to help foreigners improve their skills simply by talking to them on a regular basis.

59
00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:28.210
Now, just in case you're wondering, they're both paid positions.

60
00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:31.670
And you can charge as much as you want for either position.

61
00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:38.690
The difference, I suppose, is just the perceived value of each position or title.

62
00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:43.900
Because some people insist on working with professional teachers that have been certified by an institution

63
00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:46.970
Or other people really don't care what your credentials are.

64
00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:49.190
They just want you to talk to them and correct their mistakes.

65
00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:53.020
Now, me for example, I have zero teaching degrees or certifications,

66
00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:57.540
But I was still able to fill my schedule with motivated students who were eager to learn from me,

67
00:04:57.900 --> 00:04:59.460
And they valued the work that I did.

68
00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:03.560
I'm not going to lecture you at all about this point here,

69
00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:08.000
But the last thing I'll say is that you don't need a teaching degree to be a great teacher,

70
00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:11.980
But you do need to know what you're talking about. You know what I'm saying?

71
00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:17.900
I lost my place in my notes. Hang on. Ah, yeah.

72
00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:21.720
You don't need a degree to be a great teacher, but you do need to know what you're talking about.

73
00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:25.470
Simply being a native speaker doesn't mean you know how to teach people your language.

74
00:05:25.910 --> 00:05:29.660
You still need to take it upon yourself to do research, study your language,

75
00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:33.660
And experiment with different teaching methods until you find one that's truly effective for you.

76
00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:37.950
And it goes without saying that if people are paying you money for a service,

77
00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:40.360
Then they expect you to know what you're doing, right?

78
00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:47.130
So moving on to the next pro and that is you get to meet people from all over the world, bro.

79
00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:52.280
Apart from being able to work from anywhere in the world, you get to meet all these different people.

80
00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:57.540
Like, I've taught people from Brazil, Mexico, Japan, Tanzania, France,

81
00:05:57.650 --> 00:06:01.810
Russia, Mozambique, China, Morocco, and the list goes on and on and on.

82
00:06:03.130 --> 00:06:07.580
My appreciation of culture and different communication styles has grown so deeply over the last few years.

83
00:06:07.950 --> 00:06:11.610
Now, although challenging, it's been nothing short of a privilege to have been able

84
00:06:11.610 --> 00:06:14.340
To speak with people from so many different walks of life.

85
00:06:15.730 --> 00:06:20.530
Some of my students have ended up becoming great friends and others have gone as far as taking me out to lunch

86
00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:23.230
And inviting me into their homes when I visited their country.

87
00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:29.010
One of them even took me to the local hospital and let me use his health insurance when I got terribly sick.

88
00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:33.560
The entire world is learning to speak English.

89
00:06:34.590 --> 00:06:36.900
It's become the international language of business and travel.

90
00:06:36.900 --> 00:06:39.800
And by teaching English on Italki or online in general,

91
00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:44.280
You'll end up making connections with people from every corner of the earth.

92
00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:48.260
And you just never know how those connections will impact your life over time.

93
00:06:48.590 --> 00:06:51.850
Now, I said here "teaching English", you know, the world is learning English.

94
00:06:51.890 --> 00:06:57.660
But any language, whatever language you speak as your first language, you can teach it on this website.

95
00:06:57.660 --> 00:07:00.870
There's somebody out there that would like to learn it. You know what I'm saying?

96
00:07:02.010 --> 00:07:05.890
So just to recap some of the pros of teaching on Italki.

97
00:07:05.890 --> 00:07:08.820
Number one, there's an abundance of students.

98
00:07:09.050 --> 00:07:13.070
So this is a great option if you don't know anything about marketing

99
00:07:13.070 --> 00:07:15.280
Or you don't have the time or money to invest in marketing.

100
00:07:15.570 --> 00:07:18.290
You just want to make your profile and have people come to you.

101
00:07:19.230 --> 00:07:22.070
Italki is a great option. Any website like Italki,

102
00:07:22.070 --> 00:07:26.370
Any marketplace where the people come to you, I think that's what you need.

103
00:07:27.040 --> 00:07:29.250
Another benefit, you choose how much money you make.

104
00:07:29.920 --> 00:07:33.530
If you want to make 5, 10, 15, or $50 an hour or per class,

105
00:07:33.860 --> 00:07:36.330
You decide that not some other institution. You see?

106
00:07:37.260 --> 00:07:41.370
Another pro, you set your own schedule. You can work 2 hours in the morning,

107
00:07:41.370 --> 00:07:43.660
6 hours in the afternoon, 1 hour in the evening.

108
00:07:43.660 --> 00:07:46.600
You can work Monday, Thursday and Saturday. It's up to you.

109
00:07:47.130 --> 00:07:53.460
So you can actually do this as like, a side hustle or a second job and maintain your day job if you really want.

110
00:07:53.580 --> 00:07:56.590
And I just think that's really beneficial because if you work for a school,

111
00:07:56.590 --> 00:08:01.380
They expect you to be there every day, most likely for 4 to 8 hours. Right?

112
00:08:01.950 --> 00:08:06.200
So setting your own schedule and controlling your time is a huge benefit, in my opinion.

113
00:08:07.090 --> 00:08:10.890
Next, you don't have to have a degree or certification to teach on this platform.

114
00:08:11.580 --> 00:08:14.870
Now, this one, again, is a positive or a negative, depending on who you ask.

115
00:08:15.370 --> 00:08:17.960
But just because you have a degree doesn't mean you're a great teacher.

116
00:08:17.960 --> 00:08:20.170
And just because you don't have one doesn't mean you're a shitty teacher.

117
00:08:20.470 --> 00:08:24.850
It's really about your ability and skill individually.

118
00:08:25.460 --> 00:08:28.290
And I don't think that's connected to whether or not you have a certification.

119
00:08:28.290 --> 00:08:33.560
So, the cool thing is if you're just a naturally great teacher and you're passionate about teaching your language,

120
00:08:34.120 --> 00:08:37.240
You don't have to go to school and get this degree just to do that.

121
00:08:37.240 --> 00:08:40.180
And I think that's a huge benefit for anybody who wants to make some extra money,

122
00:08:40.500 --> 00:08:42.220
Get some teaching experience and meet new people.

123
00:08:43.230 --> 00:08:46.230
Now lastly, you get to meet people from all over the world, man.

124
00:08:47.050 --> 00:08:49.650
And, you know, maybe you're not interested in that. Maybe you don't care.

125
00:08:49.650 --> 00:08:55.060
But to me, that's amazing. There's nothing cooler than making connections with people from other countries

126
00:08:55.060 --> 00:08:59.030
And actually making friends all over the world. That is something so priceless to me, man.

127
00:08:59.550 --> 00:09:03.900
I really can't even express it any better with words, but I'm sure you get the point.

128
00:09:04.200 --> 00:09:06.640
So now let's move on to the cons.

129
00:09:06.770 --> 00:09:10.810
Let's move on to the negative aspects of teaching English on this website.

130
00:09:11.450 --> 00:09:13.780
The first one, again, in no particular order.

131
00:09:14.320 --> 00:09:20.030
Number one, Italki takes 15% of your money off the top.

132
00:09:21.430 --> 00:09:25.440
Now, I'm not sure if this number has changed since I stopped teaching on Italki back in 2020.

133
00:09:26.360 --> 00:09:30.910
But when I was using the platform, Italki charged a service fee of 15%.

134
00:09:31.510 --> 00:09:38.910
That means for every $100 that you make, Italki takes 15 of them off the top.

135
00:09:39.130 --> 00:09:43.290
And when I say 'off the top', I mean first before anything else happens.

136
00:09:43.340 --> 00:09:51.600
So you have a stack of dollar bills, for example, there's 100 of them. They're going to take 15 off the top and then you get the rest.

137
00:09:51.600 --> 00:09:54.900
So the first thing that happens is they take 15%. That's what I mean.

138
00:09:56.880 --> 00:10:02.230
To me, that's just a ridiculously high service fee. Ridiculously high.

139
00:10:02.230 --> 00:10:04.560
Especially when you consider the value of exchange, right?

140
00:10:05.490 --> 00:10:11.930
Like, Italki has brought the student to me. But after that, you'll have almost zero support from Italki.

141
00:10:12.840 --> 00:10:15.670
You work with the student, you keep the student coming back to the platform,

142
00:10:15.950 --> 00:10:19.560
And Italki sides with the student if there should ever be a dispute between the two of you.

143
00:10:20.420 --> 00:10:26.330
And for that, they expect 15% of everything you earn on their platform.

144
00:10:26.960 --> 00:10:29.890
And that's 15% on top of the 3% you'll be giving PayPal.

145
00:10:29.890 --> 00:10:35.020
And that's also after 2 to 3 weeks of waiting for your money to arrive in your fucking account.

146
00:10:36.320 --> 00:10:39.440
Now, Italki says they do payouts every 15 days, which means,

147
00:10:39.770 --> 00:10:44.290
Let's say for the past two weeks you've been having a lot of classes and you're getting paid for those classes,

148
00:10:44.560 --> 00:10:47.110
that money sits in your Italki wallet or your account,

149
00:10:47.110 --> 00:10:52.170
And you have to transfer that money from Italki to your bank account or to PayPal and then to your bank account.

150
00:10:52.500 --> 00:10:56.370
You see what I'm saying? But what they neglect to mention on the website is

151
00:10:56.370 --> 00:11:02.120
That it typically takes 7 to 10 business days for them to transfer your money to your PayPal account after the PayPal...

152
00:11:02.510 --> 00:11:05.610
Or excuse me, after the payout has been started. And after that,

153
00:11:05.610 --> 00:11:08.270
You need to transfer your money from your PayPal account to your bank account.

154
00:11:09.700 --> 00:11:15.630
Now, you do have the option to request an expedited transfer or simply deposit the money directly into your bank account.

155
00:11:16.190 --> 00:11:20.880
But you'd have to pay more money for that. Now, for some people, this isn't a con at all.

156
00:11:20.880 --> 00:11:25.240
But for me, it made much more sense to create my own platform and take complete control of my revenue,

157
00:11:25.460 --> 00:11:28.730
My profit, my client relationships, my marketing, and my branding.

158
00:11:30.460 --> 00:11:33.380
It's certainly more work, but it's also much more lucrative.

159
00:11:34.790 --> 00:11:38.100
But my way of teaching has evolved far beyond the limits of Italki,

160
00:11:38.100 --> 00:11:40.050
So I'll save that for a different episode.

161
00:11:40.980 --> 00:11:46.310
But just know Italki takes 15% of everything you earn on their platform.

162
00:11:46.310 --> 00:11:47.600
To me, that's fucking ridiculous.

163
00:11:47.670 --> 00:11:52.420
But you can decide whether or not that's a pro or con or neither, I guess. All right?

164
00:11:52.830 --> 00:11:54.080
But let's move on to the next one,

165
00:11:54.080 --> 00:12:00.240
and that is Italki makes the final decision in disputes with students and they typically side with the student.

166
00:12:01.720 --> 00:12:07.540
So let me give you an example. Let's say you and your student agreed to meet for a class on Thursday at 7 pm.

167
00:12:08.590 --> 00:12:11.700
But your student doesn't show up for class on Thursday at 7 pm.

168
00:12:13.360 --> 00:12:16.750
What happens next? You notify Italki of the problem.

169
00:12:17.510 --> 00:12:21.180
You let them know how you'd like to proceed, whether or not you'd like to reschedule the class,

170
00:12:21.220 --> 00:12:26.210
Or get the payment for the class anyway. Because you were there at the agreed time and they weren't.

171
00:12:26.210 --> 00:12:30.020
So you still need to be paid. You let them know whatever you want to do and how you want to proceed.

172
00:12:30.820 --> 00:12:34.250
And then Italki reaches out to the student and they do the same thing.

173
00:12:35.010 --> 00:12:36.450
They ask them how they'd like to proceed.

174
00:12:36.450 --> 00:12:38.890
They ask for an explanation of their absence and stuff like that.

175
00:12:39.190 --> 00:12:43.510
And the student has three days to explain their absence and decide how they would like to proceed.

176
00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:47.790
Now, you have no control over the outcome of this dispute.

177
00:12:49.440 --> 00:12:52.870
Italki employees will arbitrarily decide on the resolution themselves.

178
00:12:53.090 --> 00:12:55.200
And in my experience, regardless of the situation,

179
00:12:55.570 --> 00:12:59.580
Italki will typically choose whichever resolution favors the student.

180
00:12:59.750 --> 00:13:03.560
Because at the end of the day, Italki needs students to keep using their platform.

181
00:13:03.980 --> 00:13:06.250
They need the students to keep coming back, right?

182
00:13:07.810 --> 00:13:13.210
So in any dispute, any conflict, they're going to side with the student to make sure that they have a great experience

183
00:13:13.210 --> 00:13:16.580
And they come back to the platform. Hopefully, you get what I'm trying to say.

184
00:13:17.840 --> 00:13:27.110
But in my opinion, having a judge that's incentivized to rule in favor of one particular party is like a huge conflict of interest.

185
00:13:28.230 --> 00:13:29.380
It just doesn't seem right to me.

186
00:13:29.830 --> 00:13:34.310
Now, I understand there maybe isn't a better solution or a better way of handling problems like this.

187
00:13:34.360 --> 00:13:39.020
But I just think when you take your destiny into your own hands or you teach on your own platform

188
00:13:39.330 --> 00:13:46.930
And you manage the relationship with your, your clients, or your students, you just have more control.

189
00:13:49.200 --> 00:13:51.620
When you teach on Italki you don't have that control, you know?

190
00:13:51.620 --> 00:13:54.010
Because in that particular situation that I mentioned,

191
00:13:54.720 --> 00:13:58.150
If we agree to meet for class and I show up for class and you don't,

192
00:13:58.690 --> 00:14:03.600
I should still be paid because that's an hour of my time that could have been given to another student

193
00:14:04.030 --> 00:14:06.280
Or I could have kept for myself and done other things.

194
00:14:06.280 --> 00:14:10.470
So you had me show up at this time and dedicate an hour of my day.

195
00:14:10.470 --> 00:14:16.690
One out of only 24 to you and you didn't show up. I should be paid for that, you know?

196
00:14:17.140 --> 00:14:21.200
And when you teach on your own platform, you can receive your money upfront.

197
00:14:22.140 --> 00:14:24.940
And when I say 'upfront', that means it's similar to off the top.

198
00:14:25.090 --> 00:14:28.640
But upfront is like from the very beginning before we do anything else,

199
00:14:28.930 --> 00:14:31.220
You're going to pay for the class first, then we meet for class.

200
00:14:31.220 --> 00:14:33.860
Whereas on Italki, the student pays for the class,

201
00:14:34.370 --> 00:14:39.500
But Italki holds the money until the class is confirmed completed, then they transfer it to you. Right?

202
00:14:39.500 --> 00:14:41.410
They're the middle man, in that case.

203
00:14:41.410 --> 00:14:45.390
The man or the person in the middle of two parties doing a transaction. That's the middle man.

204
00:14:46.110 --> 00:14:51.240
And I just really dislike that structure, that way of doing things,

205
00:14:51.240 --> 00:14:54.710
Which is why or it's one of the reasons I stopped teaching on that platform. Ok?

206
00:14:55.640 --> 00:15:00.770
But anyway, let's move on to the next con, which is the scheduling system has limited flexibility.

207
00:15:00.770 --> 00:15:06.910
And when I was using the platform Italki only allowed you to schedule classes in 30 or 60-minute blocks of time

208
00:15:07.370 --> 00:15:11.240
And you can only have a class at the top of the hour, like 7 pm, for example.

209
00:15:11.560 --> 00:15:14.540
Or in the middle of the hour, like 7:30 pm, for example.

210
00:15:15.340 --> 00:15:19.910
You couldn't schedule a class at 7:15 or 7:45 or 7:50 or anything like that.

211
00:15:20.200 --> 00:15:24.370
And you also couldn't give yourself any buffer between classes.

212
00:15:25.150 --> 00:15:30.650
So what I mean is like, with a website or an app like Acuity or Calendly or something like that,

213
00:15:31.870 --> 00:15:37.920
In the settings for those websites you can make it so that if somebody schedules a class at 7:00 pm

214
00:15:37.950 --> 00:15:45.920
And it's a 30-minute class, you can set the calendar in a particular way where somebody can schedule a class from 7 to 7:30,

215
00:15:46.330 --> 00:15:48.920
But somebody can't schedule a class from 7:30 to 8.

216
00:15:50.190 --> 00:15:52.080
You can put a ten-minute buffer in there,

217
00:15:52.080 --> 00:15:55.780
Which means they could only schedule the class at 7:40, not 7:30.

218
00:15:55.780 --> 00:16:01.290
And that gives you time to breathe, get some water, use the restroom, get something to eat, or whatever.

219
00:16:01.290 --> 00:16:05.150
You just have time to like, regroup before your next class. You can't do that on Italki.

220
00:16:06.160 --> 00:16:10.630
It is a totally normal thing for 8 people to schedule 8 classes in a row.

221
00:16:10.960 --> 00:16:14.070
From 1 to 2 to 3 to 4 to 5 to 6, 7, 8, 9 pm.

222
00:16:14.450 --> 00:16:18.490
And there's no break in between those classes because the scheduling system doesn't allow for that.

223
00:16:18.560 --> 00:16:20.710
It's just class after class after class after class.

224
00:16:21.120 --> 00:16:24.740
And I just really didn't like that. I didn't like that.

225
00:16:24.880 --> 00:16:27.650
The limited flexibility in terms of scheduling, you know?

226
00:16:27.650 --> 00:16:30.780
It might not be a pro or con for you, but it was for me.

227
00:16:31.200 --> 00:16:36.210
So the next con is that you must follow their rules and regulations on their platform.

228
00:16:36.210 --> 00:16:38.120
And I know this one sounds pretty obvious.

229
00:16:39.090 --> 00:16:42.030
I mean, it's their platform, you have to follow their rules. It's just the way it is.

230
00:16:42.430 --> 00:16:49.660
But one rule that I found particularly annoying is that if a teacher doesn't respond to a class request within three days,

231
00:16:50.300 --> 00:16:54.500
The teacher gets a mark on their record. Every time this happens,

232
00:16:54.500 --> 00:16:58.740
You're expected to send an email to Italki explaining why you didn't answer the request in time

233
00:16:59.020 --> 00:17:00.590
And how you'll make sure it won't happen again.

234
00:17:00.590 --> 00:17:03.650
And if you get two or three of these marks on your record,

235
00:17:03.790 --> 00:17:07.780
Italki will simply remove your profile from the search results on their website.

236
00:17:08.930 --> 00:17:11.200
So you'll be able to book classes with your previous students,

237
00:17:11.630 --> 00:17:13.440
But new students won't be able to find you anymore.

238
00:17:14.990 --> 00:17:18.870
And Italki's logic is if you're leaving students on read, let's say,

239
00:17:18.870 --> 00:17:22.850
If you're ignoring their requests, they're going to have a bad experience and go to another platform.

240
00:17:23.610 --> 00:17:25.300
And they don't want that. Right?

241
00:17:25.870 --> 00:17:29.250
And if you're not responding to the requests, you must not be available.

242
00:17:29.330 --> 00:17:32.810
So they're going to make sure you stay unavailable until you convince them otherwise.

243
00:17:33.710 --> 00:17:36.160
That's their logic. That's their rationale and their way of doing things.

244
00:17:36.850 --> 00:17:43.390
So your whole teaching business could be tanked because you neglected to respond to a message in the time that Italki deems sufficient.

245
00:17:44.550 --> 00:17:48.600
Now, of course, as a professional, you should be responding to all messages and requests in a timely fashion.

246
00:17:48.830 --> 00:17:54.860
But the idea that somebody else could literally disrupt your entire livelihood never sat right with me.

247
00:17:55.160 --> 00:17:59.220
I didn't like that, you know? Speaking of search results,

248
00:17:59.500 --> 00:18:05.230
The next con on the list is that your rank in the search results is totally beyond your control.

249
00:18:05.790 --> 00:18:12.780
There's nothing you can do about it. Because Italki functions and serves as a search engine really.

250
00:18:13.340 --> 00:18:15.340
The same way you go on Amazon and search for a product,

251
00:18:15.340 --> 00:18:17.650
People go on Italki and search for a teacher. Right?

252
00:18:18.580 --> 00:18:22.040
Now, I have no idea how their algorithm works, but the fact is that there are hundreds,

253
00:18:22.040 --> 00:18:24.360
If not thousands of teachers on the platform

254
00:18:24.710 --> 00:18:29.290
And you have no control over whether or not you show up on the first page or the ninety-ninth page.

255
00:18:30.470 --> 00:18:33.610
Although I completely understand that not everyone can show up on the first page,

256
00:18:33.910 --> 00:18:38.330
I prefer to take more control over where I show up, for who I show up,

257
00:18:38.520 --> 00:18:40.340
and how I'm able to present myself to them.

258
00:18:40.750 --> 00:18:44.340
And again, this takes a lot more work than simply creating an Italki profile,

259
00:18:44.340 --> 00:18:48.540
But to me, it's worth it. It's totally worth it. Ok?

260
00:18:49.460 --> 00:18:50.830
Which kind of brings me to the next con.

261
00:18:52.110 --> 00:18:55.530
On Italki your options for marketing yourself are extremely limited.

262
00:18:57.700 --> 00:19:00.760
There's no real way to market yourself on Italki when I really think about it.

263
00:19:01.760 --> 00:19:07.190
Because we just talked about the fact that you might be showing up on the last page of search results when someone is looking for a teacher. Right?

264
00:19:08.230 --> 00:19:10.340
And you know nobody is going to page 99.

265
00:19:11.590 --> 00:19:15.250
Nobody's going to page 2 most of the time when they're searching for something. Right?

266
00:19:16.470 --> 00:19:25.340
So how can you attract students to your profile and convince them to give you a chance if you're showing up on page 99 of search results, right?

267
00:19:27.470 --> 00:19:30.480
I mean, you might be able to make a post on the Italki Community Forum.

268
00:19:31.130 --> 00:19:33.550
You might be able to correct people's mistakes and teach them a lesson,

269
00:19:33.550 --> 00:19:37.050
Or simply tell them that you offer private classes there in the forum.

270
00:19:37.340 --> 00:19:41.330
But that's not really what the forum is for. A forum isn't a place to promote yourself,

271
00:19:41.330 --> 00:19:43.290
it's a place to help other people. Right?

272
00:19:44.800 --> 00:19:47.380
Now, obviously, if teaching online is a side hustle for you,

273
00:19:47.780 --> 00:19:52.070
Then you might not worry as much about marketing, SEO, profit margins, and things like that.

274
00:19:52.360 --> 00:19:55.670
But if you're treating this like a business, then you might consider doing your own thing

275
00:19:56.020 --> 00:19:59.880
And learning to drive traffic to your own platform so that you're control...

276
00:20:00.190 --> 00:20:04.530
Excuse me, you're in control of your own destiny. You're in control of your profit.

277
00:20:04.720 --> 00:20:08.490
You're in control of your schedule, your branding, your marketing, all that.

278
00:20:08.490 --> 00:20:14.740
You're in control. I just don't like my destiny being in somebody else's hands.

279
00:20:15.660 --> 00:20:18.040
I don't like that idea. And I know that in many other aspects of life,

280
00:20:18.060 --> 00:20:22.060
My destiny is in someone else's hands. But hopefully, you get what I'm trying to say.

281
00:20:22.060 --> 00:20:29.920
In the context of business, working for yourself to me it's just so much better to be in complete control of the situation. You know? So...

282
00:20:31.510 --> 00:20:33.940
So there you go. Those are all the cons that I thought of.

283
00:20:33.940 --> 00:20:35.580
Let me just recap really, really quickly.

284
00:20:36.330 --> 00:20:41.900
Number one, Italki takes 15% of every dollar that you earn on their platform.

285
00:20:42.110 --> 00:20:48.490
Number two, Italki makes the final decision in disputes between you and students and they typically side with the student.

286
00:20:48.860 --> 00:20:53.120
Number three, the scheduling system on their website has very limited flexibility.

287
00:20:53.730 --> 00:20:57.550
Number four, you must follow their regulations and rules on their platform,

288
00:20:57.550 --> 00:21:00.300
No matter how fucking ridiculous those rules and regulations are.

289
00:21:00.790 --> 00:21:05.630
Number five, your search or excuse me, your rank in the search results is beyond your control.

290
00:21:06.240 --> 00:21:11.190
Number six, options for marketing yourself on the platform are also extremely limited.

291
00:21:11.480 --> 00:21:17.910
To me, all of these things were enough to convince me to go do my own thing and create my own website.

292
00:21:18.250 --> 00:21:21.550
Lifeinenglish.net. All right?

293
00:21:21.550 --> 00:21:23.710
So that's pretty much it, man.

294
00:21:23.960 --> 00:21:30.290
I look at teaching English on Italki like renting a very expensive room in someone else's house.

295
00:21:31.850 --> 00:21:35.850
Creating and operating your own website or business is like building a house from the ground up.

296
00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:38.750
And both options have their pros and cons.

297
00:21:39.430 --> 00:21:42.600
You just have to decide which one makes more sense for you. You know?

298
00:21:43.140 --> 00:21:49.140
So these days, I wouldn't recommend anybody teach on Italki if they're trying to teach full time

299
00:21:49.140 --> 00:21:53.030
And like, start a real business. I would say, do the extra work to create your own platform,

300
00:21:53.340 --> 00:21:58.020
Your own audience, your own following, do your own marketing and call people to you that way.

301
00:21:58.430 --> 00:22:02.440
But, you know, different people have different preferences

302
00:22:02.440 --> 00:22:05.090
Or personalities or time constraints, money constraints.

303
00:22:05.090 --> 00:22:10.050
So Italki can be a good option if you just wanna make some extra money or teach part-time,

304
00:22:10.050 --> 00:22:11.990
Get a little bit of experience. That's cool.

305
00:22:12.310 --> 00:22:15.800
And I actually think you should probably start there just to see if you even like it

306
00:22:15.800 --> 00:22:18.490
Before you invest all the time and energy to creating your own platform

307
00:22:18.490 --> 00:22:20.420
And website and YouTube channel and all these things.

308
00:22:20.890 --> 00:22:26.270
It's actually good to get the basic experience just teaching on some platform where there are already hundreds

309
00:22:26.270 --> 00:22:30.040
Or thousands of students looking to buy what you're selling. You know?

310
00:22:31.020 --> 00:22:35.530
So that's it, man. Those are the pros and cons of teaching English on Italki,

311
00:22:35.530 --> 00:22:36.840
Or at least the ones I could think of.

312
00:22:37.420 --> 00:22:41.210
But if you have any experience teaching on Italki or if you've taken classes on Italki,

313
00:22:41.210 --> 00:22:43.020
I'd love to know about your experience.

314
00:22:43.020 --> 00:22:47.730
So if you're watching this on YouTube, leave your experience or your comments or thoughts in the comments section below.

315
00:22:48.260 --> 00:22:54.300
Or if you're just listening, you can hit me up on social media at Englishwithkaizen on pretty much all social media platforms.

316
00:22:54.510 --> 00:22:59.450
Or if you're a member of the community, hit me up on Discord and let me know what you think about this episode, man.

317
00:23:00.290 --> 00:23:03.020
But that's it for now, my friend. Hopefully, you enjoyed the episode.

318
00:23:03.020 --> 00:23:07.150
Those were the pros and cons of teaching English or any language on Italki.

319
00:23:07.450 --> 00:23:10.300
I hope you enjoyed it and got some things to think about.

320
00:23:10.970 --> 00:23:16.330
And if you, if you're planning to teach your language independently on Italki or your own website or whatever,

321
00:23:16.330 --> 00:23:19.520
And you need some advice, you'd like to learn from my experiences and things like that,

322
00:23:19.820 --> 00:23:23.650
Don't hesitate to send me a message on one of those platforms I just mentioned,

323
00:23:23.760 --> 00:23:27.820
And it would be my pleasure to help you out and talk to you more about my experience.

324
00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:32.750
But that's it for now. That is Life in English number 134, I'm pretty sure.

325
00:23:34.020 --> 00:23:36.230
Yes. Number 134 in the books.

326
00:23:36.490 --> 00:23:38.180
I will definitely talk to you all soon. All right?

327
00:23:38.740 --> 00:23:39.080
Peace!

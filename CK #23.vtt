Tony Kaizen: Don't be an ass.

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:07.920
What's up, y'all.

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:10.370
This is Coffee with Kaizen number 23,

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:14.059
back with another thought-provoking episode for you today.

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:17.700
I saw another clip on TikTok that I thought was interesting.

00:00:17.709 --> 00:00:23.760
So I wanted to share it with you because there's some interesting vocabulary, but also an interesting idea to consider.

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:29.590
So like always, I'm going to play the clip, explain some vocabulary and then we'll talk about it.

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:32.710
And that will be it for this episode, my friend.

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:34.569
So we're not going to waste any time.

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:36.019
Let's get right into the clip.

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:37.790
I'm going to play it now.

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:42.350
Tim Ferris: Buridan's Ass.

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:48.880
It's about a donkey who is thirsty and hungry and there's water on one side, a few feet away, and hay on the other.

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:54.370
And he can't decide whether to do the hay first or the water, the hay or the water.

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:56.640
And he dies of thirst at the end of it.

00:00:57.230 --> 00:00:59.220
He couldn't do them sequentially.

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:04.760
In effect, you can do almost everything you want in life, but you can't do it at the same time.

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:09.390
And if you can just dedicate yourself to one thing for even a year,

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:13.119
and then the next thing for a year, you can do those 10 things.

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:17.300
But if you try to do all ten at once, you're going to be Buridan's Ass.

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:18.020
You know, should I do this?

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.479
Should I do this?

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:19.149
Should I focus on this?

00:01:19.149 --> 00:01:19.780
Or should I focus on this?

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:21.190
So don't be a donkey.

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:25.000
Tony Kaizen: Don't be a fucking donkey.

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:25.950
God dammit.

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:27.750
Don't be a donkey.

00:01:28.209 --> 00:01:28.780
All right, y'all.

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:31.950
Hopefully, that clip wasn't too difficult to understand.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:39.170
I know there was some music in the background, but hopefully that didn't ruin the audio experience for you.

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:39.550
All right.

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:44.170
So now I'm going to go through and explain the vocabulary that I think is useful.

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:46.139
So the first one, thirsty.

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:49.080
I think he said the donkey was thirsty and hungry.

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:54.160
So thirsty is an adjective and it means feeling a need to drink.

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:56.270
So when your mouth is dry, you need water.

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:57.270
You need something to drink.

00:01:57.490 --> 00:01:58.810
You are thirsty.

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:01.240
T H I R S T Y.

00:02:01.599 --> 00:02:02.079
Thirsty.

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:07.360
Now the noun to describe that same feeling is thirst.

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:09.180
So the noun is thirst.

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:11.300
The adjective is thirsty.

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:13.480
Next is hungry.

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:17.330
Hungry is feeling or displaying the need for food.

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:20.169
So hungry means you need something to eat.

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:22.110
Thirsty means you need something to drink.

00:02:22.309 --> 00:02:26.260
And the noun of hungry is hunger.

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:27.520
Okay.

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:32.280
So again, thirsty, hungry, thirst, hunger.

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:33.660
All right.

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:37.070
Next is whether to do this or that.

00:02:37.099 --> 00:02:39.000
I don't remember exactly what he said in the clip,

00:02:39.309 --> 00:02:44.350
but basically the donkey couldn't decide whether to drink first or to eat first.

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:47.940
So what I want to bring to your attention is that sentence structure.

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:54.019
When we say whether this or that, we use this, when we're expressing doubt between two choices.

00:02:54.099 --> 00:02:58.679
So I don't know whether I should eat first or drink first.

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:03.100
I don't know whether I should focus on my speaking or my listening skills.

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:10.070
We use that word right before we compare to things that we're unsure about, whether we should do this or that.

00:03:10.599 --> 00:03:11.590
Hopefully, that makes sense.

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:15.649
So the next thing on the list is died of thirst.

00:03:15.889 --> 00:03:20.530
And what I want you to pay attention to here is that he said died of thirst,

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:23.880
not for thirst or by thirst or with thirst or anything like that.

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:29.589
So when we say to die of something, that's our way of expressing the cause of someone's death,

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:33.070
but not just any death normally it's because it's a health issue.

00:03:33.349 --> 00:03:34.780
Like, you die of cancer.

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:38.490
Or you die of a heart attack or of thirst or of hunger,

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:41.600
but I wouldn't say you die of a car accident.

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:43.050
You see what I'm saying?

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:49.429
When we say to die of something, normally it's some physical condition or some health issue that you had...

00:03:49.759 --> 00:03:51.230
a disease or something like that.

00:03:53.059 --> 00:03:53.260
All right.

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:55.200
The next thing was at the end of it.

00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:58.300
I think he said he died of thirst at the end of it or something like that.

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:02.850
And really all that means is at the end of the story or when everything was finished,

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:04.520
when it was all said and done.

00:04:06.009 --> 00:04:09.180
It's all the same idea, at the end of it just means at the end of the story.

00:04:09.549 --> 00:04:09.629
Okay.

00:04:10.539 --> 00:04:11.129
Next was sequentially.

00:04:12.539 --> 00:04:13.930
He couldn't do them sequentially.

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:16.440
He could not eat and then drink or drink and then eat.

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:21.339
So sequentially means by forming or following a logical order or sequence.

00:04:21.849 --> 00:04:29.200
So, and even more natural way to say that just means in order 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:35.310
I said those numbers sequentially one after the other, in a sequence, a logical order.

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:38.140
Next was in effect.

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:43.270
He said, so in effect, you can do all the things you want to do, but you must do them one at a time.

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:44.460
That was basically the idea.

00:04:44.889 --> 00:04:48.279
Now this phrase in effect is not so common.

00:04:48.279 --> 00:04:55.409
So I wouldn't say this is something that you need to learn and focus on and
practice all the time, because it's not something that we say all the time.

00:04:55.410 --> 00:05:01.820
But the basic idea, it's a formal way of saying basically, or a formal way of saying,

00:05:02.179 --> 00:05:05.700
"What I'm trying to say is, or the point is...

00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:07.230
blah, blah, blah."

00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:07.700
You see?

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:10.740
So he said in effect, you can do everything you want to do.

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:18.000
So another way to say that would be basically what I'm saying is, or the point is you can do all the things you want to do.

00:05:19.309 --> 00:05:21.500
And the last one is don't be a donkey.

00:05:22.549 --> 00:05:25.630
Donkey, D O N K E Y donkey.

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:35.630
Now the scientific name for donkey, the animal is the Latin word asinus, or asinus, I don't know how to pronounce it,

00:05:36.179 --> 00:05:39.780
which I suppose is why we refer to the donkey as an ass.

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:43.500
Because you saw in the title of this episode, don't be an ass.

00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:45.409
Ass as another word for donkey.

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:46.510
Why?

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:47.220
I don't know.

00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:49.400
But like I said, the Latin word for donkey asinus.

00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:51.559
So you can see, they sound the same.

00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:57.169
Now for whatever reason, the donkey has also become synonymous with stupidity.

00:05:57.719 --> 00:06:08.130
Somebody calls you an ass or a donkey, this animal has become a symbol or synonym for an idiot or stupid or something like that, right?

00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:10.170
Just like in Spanish, if you speak Spanish or Portuguese,

00:06:10.219 --> 00:06:13.219
if you call somebody a donkey, you're calling them stupid, right?

00:06:14.099 --> 00:06:18.990
Now, if you think of the word asinine, which is very similar to asinus,

00:06:18.990 --> 00:06:24.720
asinine is a Latin, it's not a Latin word, it comes from Latin and it means extremely stupid or foolish.

00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:27.960
So maybe that's why we call people an...

00:06:27.990 --> 00:06:28.460
I don't know.

00:06:29.710 --> 00:06:30.860
Hopefully you can see the connection.

00:06:30.870 --> 00:06:33.570
It made sense in my head when I was preparing this episode,

00:06:33.900 --> 00:06:37.004
but now that I hear myself explaining it, it's like, I don't know.

00:06:37.004 --> 00:06:43.739
I don't know if that makes sense, but anyway, you might be able to see the connection and either way, that's not the point of the episode.

00:06:44.099 --> 00:06:51.879
So just to make it even more clear, he started this story or this idea by saying Buridan's Ass or Buridan's donkey.

00:06:52.330 --> 00:06:57.500
Buridan's Ass is an illustration of a paradox in philosophy in the conception of free will.

00:06:58.170 --> 00:07:04.739
It refers to a hypothetical situation wherein an ass or a donkey that is equally hungry and thirsty

00:07:04.849 --> 00:07:11.300
is placed precisely midway or in the middle of a stack of hay and a bucket of water.

00:07:11.770 --> 00:07:16.210
So since the paradox assumes that the donkey will always go to whichever is closer,

00:07:16.820 --> 00:07:23.239
it dies of both hunger and thirst since it cannot make any rational decision between the hay and the water.

00:07:23.759 --> 00:07:24.619
That's the paradox.

00:07:25.639 --> 00:07:29.219
I have two choices they're of equal distance away from me.

00:07:29.420 --> 00:07:31.630
I don't know which one to do first and I can't decide.

00:07:32.130 --> 00:07:34.650
So at the end I choose neither.

00:07:35.430 --> 00:07:37.919
And in this case, I die, right?

00:07:37.919 --> 00:07:41.979
And this is something that, uh, I've experienced personally a lot,

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:47.669
because like, I mean, just in life in general, but specifically with life in English,

00:07:47.670 --> 00:07:53.620
because now that I'm taking this thing, basically from a hobby and turning it into a business, my livelihood.

00:07:53.930 --> 00:07:54.430
It's like...

00:07:55.700 --> 00:08:02.739
it's really difficult because you have to focus on one thing at a time when
you're trying to build a business or when you're trying to work for yourself.

00:08:02.750 --> 00:08:13.690
You have to be laser-focused on your goals, your objectives, and anything other than that is detrimental to what you're trying to do.

00:08:13.700 --> 00:08:18.090
It's counterproductive to try to focus on multiple things at the same time,

00:08:18.280 --> 00:08:20.699
even though if you're working for yourself or you're starting a business,

00:08:20.700 --> 00:08:24.550
you have a bunch of different things that you need to do every single day.

00:08:25.890 --> 00:08:30.170
But that doesn't mean that you can focus on all of them at the same time, obviously.

00:08:30.510 --> 00:08:35.089
And me personally, I consider myself to be a relatively creative person.

00:08:35.099 --> 00:08:40.289
Like, I have a lot of ideas when it comes to, uh, courses, digital products,

00:08:40.639 --> 00:08:46.870
things that are going to help you improve your English more effectively and a more interesting way, maybe even faster.

00:08:47.230 --> 00:08:50.150
I have a bunch of different ideas for stuff that I would like to create.

00:08:50.750 --> 00:08:52.720
But at the same time, I'm just one person, you know?

00:08:52.720 --> 00:08:57.250
So I have to do the recording, the writing, the editing, the marketing, the graphic design.

00:08:57.270 --> 00:08:58.079
I mean, all these things.

00:08:58.080 --> 00:09:02.130
I'm building a new website for a VIP membership that I plan to offer.

00:09:02.360 --> 00:09:03.500
There's a bunch of stuff.

00:09:03.990 --> 00:09:09.339
But what I noticed is this last month that I've been doing Coffee with Kaizen basically every day,

00:09:09.740 --> 00:09:13.749
plus the Life in English podcast, plus all this other stuff, it's like,...

00:09:14.440 --> 00:09:17.533
I was going crazy trying to focus on this and that and that and that,

00:09:17.609 --> 00:09:20.880
and that trying to do everything in one day, every single day.

00:09:21.310 --> 00:09:27.310
And you just get burnt out, man, you realize that, trying to do everything at once or focus on a bunch of different things,

00:09:27.310 --> 00:09:30.189
having a bunch of different ideas in your head all the time...

00:09:31.380 --> 00:09:32.510
isn't good for anybody.

00:09:32.520 --> 00:09:36.870
Because you might work 10 minutes on this and then you get distracted 'cause you have another idea.

00:09:36.870 --> 00:09:38.220
Then you work 20 minutes on that.

00:09:38.530 --> 00:09:40.329
And then, oh, I remember I got to do this.

00:09:40.329 --> 00:09:44.469
Then you work 30 minutes on that and five minutes here, then you get stressed.

00:09:44.470 --> 00:09:46.190
So you just walk away from everything.

00:09:46.460 --> 00:09:49.180
It's just, you're constantly resetting your focus,

00:09:49.180 --> 00:09:53.579
you never get into this groove or this flow state where you can just focus on that

00:09:53.850 --> 00:09:57.050
and do that with a hundred percent of your effort and attention.

00:09:57.050 --> 00:09:57.720
You know?

00:09:57.990 --> 00:10:01.730
You always giving them 5% to this, 10% to that, 20% to that.

00:10:02.630 --> 00:10:04.550
And that's never a good idea.

00:10:04.620 --> 00:10:08.840
I think if you're going to do something, give it a hundred percent every single time.

00:10:09.160 --> 00:10:11.060
In my experience, that's the best way to do it.

00:10:11.279 --> 00:10:11.620
You know?

00:10:11.830 --> 00:10:15.699
So, trying to bring it back to you, not just talking about myself,

00:10:15.900 --> 00:10:19.860
I would say it's the same thing for your English, but just life in general, man.

00:10:19.860 --> 00:10:24.849
If you find yourself in situations where there's so many things you want to do,

00:10:25.730 --> 00:10:29.429
let's say with your life in general, you have a lot of dreams and goals and things you would like to do.

00:10:30.830 --> 00:10:35.760
It's easy to say and not so easy to do sometimes, but you got to choose one.

00:10:36.710 --> 00:10:37.360
Just one.

00:10:37.950 --> 00:10:41.310
And that could be for two hours, you focus on one thing.

00:10:41.320 --> 00:10:45.959
It could be for two days, two weeks or two years, but you can only focus on one thing at a time.

00:10:46.240 --> 00:10:51.760
I'm not sure it's humanly possible to truly focus on more than one thing.

00:10:53.170 --> 00:10:54.180
I really don't think it is.

00:10:54.540 --> 00:10:57.370
A lot of times we think we're capable of, like, multitasking...

00:10:57.990 --> 00:10:59.540
doing this and this at the same time.

00:10:59.540 --> 00:11:02.540
But when you're doing this, you might be aware of this thing over here,

00:11:02.540 --> 00:11:04.319
but you're not focused on it, you know?

00:11:04.319 --> 00:11:10.209
And I think it's the same thing when you have to make choices on how you're going to spend your time or which direction you're going to go in.

00:11:10.220 --> 00:11:12.010
You can't go in two directions at the same time.

00:11:12.580 --> 00:11:14.270
Can't do two things at the same time.

00:11:14.770 --> 00:11:15.040
Right?

00:11:15.710 --> 00:11:17.350
You can't have two thoughts at the same time.

00:11:17.350 --> 00:11:21.839
So focus is the key to achieving what you want to achieve.

00:11:22.469 --> 00:11:22.959
Because like..

00:11:23.100 --> 00:11:26.910
like he said, you can do it all, but you can't do it all at the same time.

00:11:27.390 --> 00:11:30.160
So don't be a fucking donkey.

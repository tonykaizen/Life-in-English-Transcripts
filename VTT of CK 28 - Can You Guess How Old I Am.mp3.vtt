Here's a joke in the form of a story.
00:00:04.810 --> 00:00:11.280
A woman decided to have a facelift for her 50th birthday. She spent $20,000 and she looked sensational.
00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:15.280
On her way home, she stopped at a newsstand to buy a newspaper.
00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:20.770
She said to the clerk "I hope you don't mind me asking, but how old do you think I am?".

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:24.290
The man said, "About 32".

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:28.530
She said happily, "Nope, I'm exactly 50".

00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:33.850
A while later, she went into a McDonald's and asked the girl at the counter the same question.

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.720
The girl replied, "I guess about twenty-nine".

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:42.180
The woman replied with a big smile "Nope, I'm exactly 50".

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:49.460
A short time later, my friend Bob was sitting at a bus stop when the woman sat down next to him and asked the same question.

00:00:50.810 --> 00:01:00.800
Bob considered and said "I have a surefire way to tell your age, but it requires you to let me put my hands under your bra. If you let me, I will tell you exactly how old you are."

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:08.610
They waited in silence for a bit. The woman realized the street was empty and her curiosity got the better of her.

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:12.200
She finally blurted out "Oh, what the hell, go ahead".

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:18.200
Bob slipped both of his hands under her blouse and began to feel around slowly and carefully.

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:23.160
He bounced and weighed. He pinched, pushed, rubbed, and squeezed.

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:27.560
After a few minutes, she said, "OK, OK, how old am I?".

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:33.170
Bob said, "Ma'am, you're exactly 50".

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:36.920
Stunned and amazed, the woman said, "That was incredible! How could you tell?".

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:41.110
And Bob answered, "I was behind you at McDonald's".

00:00:01.220 --> 00:00:09.830
Bernie Mac:
I had a white guy tell me, he said, "Bern...Why do black
people always use the word motherfucker?" Well, I'm going to

2
00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:17.900
break down what the word "motherfucker" actually means.
"Motherfucker" is something that black folks (have) been

3
00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:25.010
using for years. It's about expression. Don't be ashamed of
the word "motherfucker".

4
00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:32.320
Cos the word "motherfucker" is a noun. It describes a
person, place or thing.

5
00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:37.890
(audience laughs) You know when you hear black folk, we
loud.

6
00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.960
That's our defense mechanism. We loud, we talk aggressive,
you know? (gibberish) You know, we ain't gonna do nothing to

7
00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.100
you. We ain't gonna do nothing to you. You know, we'll tell
you in a minute, you know? I'll blow this motherfucker up,

8
00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:52.530
you know? You ain't never known a black terrorist in a day
of your life. You ain't never known a black man to blow up a

9
00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:58.770
goddamn thing. First of all, where he gonna buy the dynamite
from, and from who? The first time he tried to buy some

10
00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:05.060
dynamite, he going to jail like a motherfucker. It's just
expression! I had a guy, man... when you...when white

11
00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:09.280
people, when you... when you see my people and you see 'em
in a social place, you see 'em in the mall, you see 'em in

12
00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:16.380
the bowling alley, and you might see three or four brothers
together. You might hear the word motherfucker 32 times. And

13
00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:25.800
you might hear just two regular English words. But the
conversation makes sense like a motherfucker. Everybody can

14
00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:32.930
understand it. Don't be afraid of the word "motherfucker".
I'm gonna break it down to you. If you out there this

15
00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:41.220
afternoon, you see about three or four brothers talking, you
might hear a conversation and it go like this. You seen that

16
00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:48.910
motherfucker Bobby? That motherfucker owe me 35
motherfucking dollars. He told me he (was) gonna pay my

17
00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:57.160
motherfucking money last motherfucking week. I ain't seen
this motherfucker yet. I'm not gonna chase this motherfucker

18
00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:05.360
for my 35 motherfucking dollars. I called the motherfucker
four motherfucking times. But the motherfucker won't call me

19
00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:13.660
back. I called his mama the other motherfucking day. She
gonna play like the motherfucker wasn't in. I started to

20
00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:23.660
cuss her motherfucking ass out but I want no motherfucking
trouble. But I'll tell you one motherfucking thing, the next

21
00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:31.940
motherfucking time I see this motherfucker and he ain't got
my motherfucking money, I'm gon' bust his motherfucking

22
00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:36.380
head. And I'm out this motherfucker!

23
00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:44.260
Tony Kaizen:
What's up, my friend? I hope you are doing well today. If
this is your first time listening to the podcast then I'd

24
00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:50.950
like to welcome you to your life in English. My name is Tony
Kaizen and I'm here to help you learn real spoken English in

25
00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:58.240
a practical way. Now the clip you just heard was of the late
and great and legendary stand-up comedian Bernie Mac,

26
00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:04.190
representing the Southside of Chicago, Illinois. Now, in
this clip, Bernie explains how to use the English word

27
00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:09.100
"motherfucker", just like a native. But don't worry, if you
couldn't understand everything he said because he was

28
00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:15.400
speaking in a very colloquial way and speaking very fast,
right? But now, I'm gonna go back and explain not only

29
00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:21.030
Bernie's words, but also the culture behind his words to
make sure you really understand everything he said in the

30
00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:26.550
clip, alright? Let's get started.

31
00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:32.260
Bernie Mac:
I had a white guy tell me, he said, "Bern... Why do black
people always use the word motherfucker?

32
00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:40.390
Tony Kaizen:
Now I'm stopping here because I'm sure some people might be
asking themselves, "Why does he feel the need to refer to

33
00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:48.780
people's skin color at a time like this?" He said, "A white
guy asked me why do black people always use the word

34
00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:54.640
motherfucker?" Well, you got to remember that after slavery
was abolished in this country, black and white people were

35
00:03:54.640 --> 00:04:01.600
still segregated by law for an entire century. And that
means for 100 years, black and white people lived in

36
00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:07.800
separate neighborhoods, went to separate schools, played at
separate parks, rode on separate buses, and even went to

37
00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:13.400
separate jails. It was literally against the law for these
two groups of people to interact with each other in their

38
00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:22.280
daily lives. As a result, two distinct cultures started to
develop here in the US — 'Black American culture' and 'White

39
00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:29.260
American culture'. And this is where things can get
controversial because everyone has a different opinion about

40
00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:36.200
what I just said and everyone will describe the situation in
their own way. The topic of black and white in this country

41
00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:41.820
is hard to explain because there's so much history behind it
and even I am not familiar with all of it. This is just

42
00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:50.990
uneducated opinion, okay? But for now, the only thing you
need to understand is that 100 years of racial segregation

43
00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:58.860
led us to having two distinct dialects of spoken English
here in the US — Standard English, which is what most people

44
00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:07.920
speak and understand across the country and Ebonics, also
known as Black English or African American vernacular

45
00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:13.740
English. And this dialect is predominantly spoken by Black
Americans.

46
00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:18.940
And that's why there are times when some white people
literally can't understand what black people are saying

47
00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:24.860
because they're not familiar with the dialect, especially 20
years ago when this clip was recorded. And that's why Bernie

48
00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:31.130
is speaking to the crowd as if it were two groups of people
— white people and black people. And you'll hear him explain

49
00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:36.890
the way black people behave because he knows some white
people just don't understand it. Now, it's important to

50
00:05:36.890 --> 00:05:42.490
remember that I'm generalizing here, and so was Bernie. I
think we make very general statements when speaking about

51
00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:49.750
race in this country because it's easier for us to express
ourselves that way. But not all black people think and talk

52
00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:56.830
and behave the same. And not all white people think and talk
and behave the same way, obviously. And we could go much,

53
00:05:56.830 --> 00:06:01.560
much deeper into that topic. But I'm just trying to help you
understand the culture behind the words being said here,

54
00:06:02.010 --> 00:06:06.760
because that's the only way you can truly understand what
he's communicating, alright? But let's get back to the clip.

55
00:06:09.870 --> 00:06:14.770
Bernie Mac:
You know when you hear black folk, we loud. That's our
defense mechanism, We...we're loud, we talk aggressive, you

56
00:06:15.670 --> 00:06:19.370
know? (gibberish) You know, we ain't gonna do nothing to
you. We ain't gonna do nothing to you. You know, we'll tell

57
00:06:19.370 --> 00:06:21.710
you in a minute, you know? I'll blow this motherfucker up,
you know?

58
00:06:23.910 --> 00:06:28.980
Tony Kaizen:
Alright, I'm stopping here because Bernie mentioned an
interesting cultural observation. A common stereotype of

59
00:06:28.980 --> 00:06:36.020
black Americans is that we're very loud, angry, aggressive
people, right? And Bernie's saying there's no need to fear

60
00:06:36.020 --> 00:06:41.420
black people's loud and aggressive behavior. It's just a
form of self-defense. It's our way of showing that we're

61
00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:46.310
confident in ourselves and we're not afraid of anyone, which
is something that's very important in the black community,

62
00:06:46.310 --> 00:06:52.730
especially if you're a man. Showing confidence and playfully
talking shit is just one of those cultural behaviors that

63
00:06:52.730 --> 00:06:56.310
shouldn't be taken so seriously. I believe that's what he's
communicating.

64
00:06:58.470 --> 00:07:02.880
Bernie Mac:
You know when you hear black folk, we loud. That's our
defense mechanism. We...we're loud, we talk aggressive, you

65
00:07:02.910 --> 00:07:07.400
know? (gibberish) You know, we ain't gonna do nothing to
you. We ain't gonna do nothing to you. You know, we'll tell

66
00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:12.920
you in a minute, you know? I'll blow this motherfucker up,
you know? You ain't never known a black terrorist in a day

67
00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:18.120
of your life. You ain't never known a black man to blow up a
goddamn thing. First of all, where he gonna buy the dynamite

68
00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:23.030
from, and from who? The first time we tried to buy some
dynamite, he going to jail like a motherfucker.

69
00:07:25.850 --> 00:07:31.380
Tony Kaizen:
Alright, let me stop here and explain a couple of key things
about this part of the clip. The first one is "I'll blow

70
00:07:31.380 --> 00:07:39.110
this motherfucker up". Bernie said, um, you know, you
shouldn't be worried about the aggressive, loud way that

71
00:07:39.110 --> 00:07:44.570
some black people talk. It's just a defense mechanism,
right? You might hear a black person say, "I'll blow this

72
00:07:44.570 --> 00:07:51.900
motherfucker up, you know?" And to "blow something up" means
to make something explode, right? With a bomb or some

73
00:07:51.900 --> 00:07:58.630
dynamite, something like that. And "motherfucker" in this
case is... is being used to say place because remember

74
00:07:58.630 --> 00:08:03.680
"motherfucker" mean - is a person, place or thing. So when
somebody says, "I'll blow this motherfucker up." They're

75
00:08:03.680 --> 00:08:10.870
saying, "I'll blow this place up." And this is like, uh,
it's like a cultural thing. That's hard to explain. But you

76
00:08:10.870 --> 00:08:17.220
might hear especially, you know, a black person from my
parents' generation or my grandparents' generation, you

77
00:08:17.220 --> 00:08:22.950
know, it was a common thing. Even today, though, you know,
some people will just make these empty threats knowing that

78
00:08:22.950 --> 00:08:29.400
they don't really mean it but it just sounds good when you
say it, right? It just sounds good to say in an argument, in

79
00:08:29.400 --> 00:08:35.230
a misunderstanding, in an altercation in some public place.
And you want to seem like a badass. You want to seem like

80
00:08:35.230 --> 00:08:41.050
you're not afraid, that you're crazy. "I'll blow this
motherfucker up. Don't play with me!" You know, just like, I

81
00:08:41.050 --> 00:08:45.320
don't know if that makes sense to you, but it's...it's an
empty threat. You're obviously not going to blow up the

82
00:08:45.320 --> 00:08:50.730
fucking building. It's just something that people say. So
hopefully that makes sense to you now. The second thing I

83
00:08:50.730 --> 00:08:56.680
want to explain was, uh, the word "goddamn" in this case,
because Bernie said, you ain't never known a black man to

84
00:08:56.680 --> 00:09:04.590
blow up a goddamn thing. And "goddamn", in this case is
being used to put emphasis on whatever's being said after

85
00:09:04.590 --> 00:09:12.070
that. In this case, the word thing, you ain't never known a
black man to blow up a goddamn thing. It's just a stronger

86
00:09:12.070 --> 00:09:18.450
way of saying you've never heard of a black man blowing up
anything, you know? And he's not mad in this case. It's not

87
00:09:18.450 --> 00:09:24.270
why he's saying goddamn. Again, it's just emphasis. Um, but
obviously, you're not going to speak this way with people

88
00:09:24.270 --> 00:09:29.490
you don't really know. You're not going to speak this way at
work and stuff like that, you know? Now, the last thing from

89
00:09:29.490 --> 00:09:36.630
this part of the clip was alright "like a motherfucker". He
said, um, the first time he tried to buy some dynamite, he

90
00:09:36.630 --> 00:09:43.030
going to jail like a motherfucker and "like a motherfucker"
in this case is also being used to put emphasis on whatever

91
00:09:43.030 --> 00:09:51.540
was just said. So in this case, if he going to jail like a
motherfucker, it's like he's definitely going to jail. He's

92
00:09:51.540 --> 00:09:57.430
certainly going to jail. No doubt. No question. He going to
jail like a motherfucker. He just put an emphasis on that

93
00:09:57.430 --> 00:10:06.190
fact that he's certainly going to jail. Or you might hear
somebody say, like, let's imagine I...I stubbed my toe on a

94
00:10:06.190 --> 00:10:12.670
coffee table or something and it hurts really bad. I say,
"Damn, that hurt like a motherfucker." It just means it

95
00:10:12.670 --> 00:10:18.860
really, really hurt. I mean, it hurt really bad. "Shit, hurt
like a motherfucker, man." Hopefully that makes sense.

96
00:10:18.860 --> 00:10:24.830
It's...I mean, this is, like, just a colloquial way of
speaking that doesn't always make literal sense. So

97
00:10:25.390 --> 00:10:32.380
hopefully, at least with these explanations, it's a bit more
clear and you can follow the clip, uh, better than before.

98
00:10:32.380 --> 00:10:35.430
But anyway, anyway, let's get back to the clip, my friend.

99
00:10:38.040 --> 00:10:42.170
Bernie Mac:
I had a guy, man... when you, when white people, when you,
when you see my people and you see 'em in the social place,

100
00:10:42.170 --> 00:10:46.530
you see 'em in the mall, you see 'em in the bowling alley,
and you might see three or four brothers together and you

101
00:10:46.530 --> 00:10:48.620
might hear the word motherfucker 32 times.

102
00:10:51.550 --> 00:10:57.340
Tony Kaizen:
Alright. Now, notice how Bernie said when you see three or
four brothers. Now the word "brother" in this case is being

103
00:10:57.340 --> 00:11:03.190
used colloquially to say "man". So when you see three or
four men standing on the corner. But you should know that

104
00:11:03.510 --> 00:11:08.800
this type of thing is becoming less and less common. Like
you typically hear people from my dad's generation speaking

105
00:11:08.800 --> 00:11:16.080
in this way. Kids from the Fortnite generation don't
typically refer to their peers as brother or sister like,

106
00:11:16.080 --> 00:11:23.160
"Hey, you see that young brother right there?" or "What's
going on, sister?" Like, we don't really refer to each other

107
00:11:23.160 --> 00:11:29.540
in that way these days - not young people anyway. But it is,
um, still common like I'll...I'll speak that way sometimes

108
00:11:29.540 --> 00:11:35.950
and people from my dad's and grandfather's generation
definitely. This is something they would say. A lot of young

109
00:11:35.950 --> 00:11:41.520
people these days would say "nigga" like "You see three or
four niggas on the corner, man?" I'm just joking. Anyway, I

110
00:11:41.520 --> 00:11:46.200
just wanted to explain that really quick, just in case
somebody was confused by that. But let's continue.

111
00:11:48.780 --> 00:11:54.720
Bernie Mac:
If you out there this afternoon, you see about three or four
brothers talking, you might hear a conversation and it go

112
00:11:54.720 --> 00:11:55.290
like this.

113
00:11:57.390 --> 00:12:01.600
Tony Kaizen:
Alright. Now, before you listen to the dialogue, I want you
to notice the fact that Bernie is using the words

114
00:12:01.600 --> 00:12:11.440
"motherfucker" and "motherfucking" repeatedly the word
"motherfucker" with the ER on the end - this word is a

115
00:12:11.440 --> 00:12:20.400
noun. It describes a person, place or thing, right? The word
"motherfucking" with an ING on the end is something like an

116
00:12:20.460 --> 00:12:26.320
adjective. But it's really just used to put emphasis on
whatever you're referring to at the time. And this is

117
00:12:26.320 --> 00:12:34.240
obviously a very vulgar way of speaking, right? I know you
hear us use strong words like these very casually, but if

118
00:12:34.240 --> 00:12:40.410
you're a non-native and you're learning the language, I
suggest you don't overuse curse words with people you don't

119
00:12:40.410 --> 00:12:47.920
know very well because there's an art to using curse words
naturally, right? And it takes time for one to master that

120
00:12:47.970 --> 00:12:55.720
art, okay? But anyway, let's get back to the clip. And
remember, motherfucker is a noun. Motherfucking is an

121
00:12:55.720 --> 00:12:56.290
adjective.

122
00:12:59.020 --> 00:13:04.960
Bernie Mac:
If you out there this afternoon, you see about three or four
brothers talking, you might hear a conversation and it go

123
00:13:04.960 --> 00:13:08.990
like this. You seen that motherfucker Bobby?

124
00:13:10.610 --> 00:13:17.090
That motherfucker owe me 35 motherfucking dollars. He told
me he (was) gonna pay my motherfucker money last

125
00:13:17.120 --> 00:13:25.600
motherfucking week. I ain't seen this motherfucker yet. I'm
not gonna chase this motherfucker for my 35 motherfucking

126
00:13:25.600 --> 00:13:31.050
dollars. I've called the motherfucker four motherfucking
times.

127
00:13:31.050 --> 00:13:37.820
But the motherfucker won't call me back. I called his mama
the other motherfucking day. She gonna play like the

128
00:13:37.820 --> 00:13:47.820
motherfucker wasn't in. I started to cuss her motherfucking
ass out but I want no motherfucking trouble. But

129
00:13:47.820 --> 00:13:54.540
I'll tell you one motherfucking thing, the next
motherfucking time I see this motherfucker and he ain't got

130
00:13:54.560 --> 00:14:03.350
my motherfucking money, I'm gon' bust his motherfucking
head. And I'm out this motherfucker!

131
00:14:06.190 --> 00:14:10.080
Tony Kaizen:
Alright, if you're reading the transcript, it'll be much
easier to see how Bernie alternates between the words

132
00:14:10.080 --> 00:14:15.530
"motherfucker" and "motherfucking" depending on who or what
he's referring to. And by the way, if you'd like to read a

133
00:14:15.530 --> 00:14:21.380
transcript of all the podcast episodes, along with the
vocabulary Guide explaining advanced words and phrases that

134
00:14:21.380 --> 00:14:29.000
you hear, you can visit lifeinenglish.net/community and sign
up to get access. But instead of going back and explaining

135
00:14:29.020 --> 00:14:34.700
each line of that dialogue right there, I'm gonna read it to
you in standard English and hopefully you'll understand it

136
00:14:34.700 --> 00:14:41.330
much better. Alright, if you see three or four guys standing
on a street corner, you might hear a conversation and it

137
00:14:41.330 --> 00:14:44.840
goes like this. Hey, have you seen Bobby?

138
00:14:45.610 --> 00:14:53.040
That guy owes me 35 dollars. He told me he was gonna pay me
my money last week and I haven't seen this guy yet. Now, I'm

139
00:14:53.040 --> 00:15:00.130
not gonna chase this guy for my 35 dollars. I called him
four times, but the guy won't call me back. I called his

140
00:15:00.130 --> 00:15:06.740
mother the other day and she acted as if the guy wasn't
home. And I almost cursed her right there on the phone but I

141
00:15:06.740 --> 00:15:13.180
don't want any problems with anyone. But I'll tell you one
thing, the next time I see this guy and he doesn't have my

142
00:15:13.180 --> 00:15:21.110
money, I'm gonna knock his ass out. And then Bernie says,
"I'm out this motherfucker!" but that part's not, you know,

143
00:15:21.110 --> 00:15:27.390
it's not part of the dialogue. When someone says "I'm out"
in a context like this, it just means I'm leaving and you're

144
00:15:27.390 --> 00:15:32.550
just listening to this so you can't see what happened but in
the clip, Bernie says, "I'm out this motherfucker!" And then

145
00:15:32.550 --> 00:15:38.970
he literally left the stage at that point. And when he says,
"I'm out this motherfucker!" ,"motherfucker" in this case

146
00:15:38.970 --> 00:15:44.890
means this place because I'm out means I'm leaving. This
motherfucker means this place so in standard English it's

147
00:15:44.890 --> 00:15:51.380
like I'm leaving this place, the show is over, I'm gone, you
know? Hopefully that makes sense. Now, at this point, my

148
00:15:51.380 --> 00:15:56.920
friend, I suggest you listen to the entire episode again to
make sure you understand everything that was said. Matter

149
00:15:56.920 --> 00:16:04.370
fact, listen to all the episodes multiple times to ensure
you retain all this golden information. Now, I'd like to

150
00:16:04.370 --> 00:16:08.930
thank you for your time and your attention, my friend. I
really hope you enjoyed this episode. This is Life in

151
00:16:08.930 --> 00:16:13.590
English. I am your host, Tony Kaizen, and I'll talk to you
soon. Peace!

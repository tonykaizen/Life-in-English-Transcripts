1
00:00:01.230 --> 00:00:04.950
I'm a firm believer that every single person on this planet should have their own podcast.

2
00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:09.590
If not a podcast, then a YouTube channel or a blog or a journal.

3
00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:13.680
Everyone should have some way of recording their life experiences and their thoughts.

4
00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:19.170
And think about it. Have you ever sat down with your family and looked at your baby pictures?

5
00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:23.580
Do you ever watch old videos of your younger siblings or your children?

6
00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:26.650
Imagine if those photos had never been taken.

7
00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:29.360
Imagine if no one had ever recorded those videos.

8
00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:33.460
Imagine having no way of looking back into the past

9
00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:36.950
And remembering those pleasant details about your life or that of your loved ones.

10
00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:44.010
Now imagine arriving at the tender age of 85 and having almost no record of your life.

11
00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:49.070
Now, most people are taking more pictures and recording more videos than ever before.

12
00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:52.630
So I'm sure most people with smartphones will have plenty of pictures and videos.

13
00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:58.960
But podcasting or keeping a journal is different in the sense that you're not recording the way things looked.

14
00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:01.290
You're recording the way you used to think.

15
00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:06.120
You're recording countless thoughts and experiences that are likely to be forgotten.

16
00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:11.240
So it really is the best way to track your internal progress over time.

17
00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:16.900
Keeping a record of your life's experiences is the best way to learn from them. Right?

18
00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:23.560
Recording a podcast and then listening to it is the best way to hear what you really think and how you really sound.

19
00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:27.610
So I recommend that all language learners start a podcast

20
00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:33.630
Or some type of audiovisual diary that records their progress, even if no one ever listens to it.

21
00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:37.080
But if you don't want to start a podcast, that's fine.

22
00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:40.000
I'll talk in more detail about that in another episode.

23
00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:43.580
But right now I'm still going to share a brilliant exercise with you

24
00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:47.600
That will have the same effect on your English and communication skills. Okay?

25
00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:52.500
So the clip I'm about to share with you is of a man named Vinh Giang.

26
00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:57.120
Hopefully, I pronounced that correctly. You can find him on Tik Tok at Ask Vinh.

27
00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:07.400
That's A S K V I N H. Ask Vinh on TikTok. Hopefully, I pronounced that correctly.

28
00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:11.910
But I've spelt his screen name for you, so hopefully, you can find him.

29
00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:17.870
And in this clip, Vinh explains a simple three-step formula for improving your communication skills.

30
00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:22.070
And the best part is that you don't need anyone's help to do this exercise. Okay?

31
00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:26.230
So Vinh speaks... No, I fucked that up.

32
00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:30.530
Vinh has an Australian accent and the video is pretty fast,

33
00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:33.910
So don't feel bad or confused if you don't understand everything the first time.

34
00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:38.030
And remember, you can always read the transcript. All right? So let's get started.

35
00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:44.880
Vinh Giang:
Simply record a five-minute video of yourself and you need to speak improvised.

36
00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:49.910
The first time you review it, turn the sound all the way up, press play, turn your phone down, just listen.

37
00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:53.420
Audit the auditory component of your voice known as your vocal image.

38
00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:55.470
What do you like about it? What don't you like about it?

39
00:02:55.470 --> 00:03:00.610
Second, grab the phone, turn the sound off, press play, make sure it's on mute, just look at yourself.

40
00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:02.820
How is your body language? What's your facial expressions like?

41
00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:05.170
Do a visual audit of your visual image.

42
00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:07.950
Third component, get the video transcribed, red highlighter,

43
00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:11.090
bring all your nonwords and filler words to the forefront of your mind.

44
00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:13.100
That's robbing you of clarity every time you talk.

45
00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:15.060
You basically have a mirror in front of you.

46
00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:22.400
Tony Kaizen:
All right. Now, like I said, you know, not only was the audio not so good,

47
00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:26.510
But he has an accent very different from mine. And the video was for social media, so...

48
00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:30.870
It was from a longer video and they cut it up into little pieces to make it much faster.

49
00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:34.590
So, he wasn't really talking that fast, but the video makes it seem that way.

50
00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:38.170
So don't feel bad if you couldn't understand everything the first time. All right?

51
00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:42.080
We're going to go back through and I'm going to divide the video into three pieces,

52
00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:45.330
You know, the three steps. So we'll go back and look at the first one.

53
00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:49.140
Or listen to the first one, right? Here we go.

54
00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:53.540
Vinh Giang:
Simply record a five-minute video of yourself and you need to speak.

55
00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:56.640
Improvise. So the first time you review it, turn the sound all the way up,

56
00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:59.230
Press play, turn your phone down, just listen.

57
00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:03.560
What? The auditory component of your voice known as your vocal image.

58
00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:06.600
What do you like about it? What don't you like about it? Second.

59
00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:12.290
Tony Kaizen:
Okay, so that's step number one, which he calls the vocal image review.

60
00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:17.480
So just in case you didn't understand, this is when you're basically just listening to your voice.

61
00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:19.810
So what you do is record yourself speaking for 5 minutes.

62
00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:23.980
You can pick any subject. It really does not matter. Excuse me.

63
00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:27.060
Pick any subject. It doesn't matter what subject. Right?

64
00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:32.720
Just speak uninterrupted for 5 minutes straight. On camera, record yourself on camera.

65
00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:34.370
Use a cell phone, video camera, or whatever.

66
00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:41.400
And when you're listening to it, turn the volume all the way up, maximum volume, as loud as possible.

67
00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:43.500
But do not look at the phone screen.

68
00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:50.300
Put the phone down on the table so that you cannot see the screen and just listen to yourself.

69
00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:54.780
And take note or pay attention to... Excuse me.

70
00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:58.170
Take note of what you don't like about the way you sound.

71
00:04:58.290 --> 00:05:00.840
Take note of what you do like about the way you sound.

72
00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:06.140
But all you're doing is paying attention to the sound. That's it.

73
00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:11.570
Are you monotone where every single word you said sounds like this?

74
00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:18.480
I used to talk like that and it wasn't until I started my podcast that I realized how fucking boring my voice actually was.

75
00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:27.370
It was so monotone and everything I said was like this because I was afraid to express emotion when I spoke.

76
00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:32.680
I was afraid of what people would think if I truly expressed myself. You understand?

77
00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:35.910
I didn't even notice that until I started my fucking podcast,

78
00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:39.270
Until I did my vocal image review, you understand?

79
00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:43.020
So that's the benefit of step number one. Just listening to the way you sound.

80
00:05:43.420 --> 00:05:44.300
It's going to be painful.

81
00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:48.370
You might feel embarrassed or disgusted the first 20 times you do it, and that's fine.

82
00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:49.970
It's totally normal, trust me.

83
00:05:51.490 --> 00:05:55.550
But I guarantee it's going to help you improve the way you sound when you speak.

84
00:05:57.320 --> 00:06:00.570
You can't improve what you can't hear. Right?

85
00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:03.280
If you can't hear the way you sound, how are you going to improve the way you sound?

86
00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:07.140
Simple logic that we never take the time to consider. Right?

87
00:06:07.140 --> 00:06:11.540
So that's step number one. Record yourself and only listen to your tone of voice,

88
00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:15.630
You know, how fast you talk, how many pauses you take. Stuff like that.

89
00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:22.190
What does it sound like? Does the tone of voice and the way you express yourself match with what you were saying?

90
00:06:22.950 --> 00:06:25.760
If you were talking about something that made you angry. Do you sound angry?

91
00:06:26.910 --> 00:06:29.640
If you're talking about something that made you laugh. Are you laughing?

92
00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:34.080
Does it sound funny? Take note of that stuff. Take note of it.

93
00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:37.540
Because the better you can get at communicating what you're saying,

94
00:06:38.270 --> 00:06:39.650
The better your message will be received.

95
00:06:39.650 --> 00:06:43.550
And remember, communication is not just what you say, it's how you say it.

96
00:06:44.770 --> 00:06:46.690
And that's what you're trying to focus on with step number one.

97
00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:51.710
How you say things and how you sound. Okay? So let's move on to step number two.

98
00:06:54.350 --> 00:06:59.020
Vinh Giang:
Grab the phone, turn the sound off, press play, make sure it's on mute, just look at yourself.

99
00:06:59.150 --> 00:07:01.230
How is your body language? What's your facial expressions like?

100
00:07:01.230 --> 00:07:03.950
Do a visual audit of your visual image that can.

101
00:07:05.890 --> 00:07:09.240
Tony Kaizen:
Okay. So he said, "Do a visual audit of your visual image".

102
00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:11.490
Let me just find the definition for 'audit' really quick.

103
00:07:12.020 --> 00:07:13.670
Just in case you were wondering what that means.

104
00:07:14.820 --> 00:07:20.520
Audit. To conduct an official financial examination of an individual's accounts.

105
00:07:23.060 --> 00:07:31.660
Technically, yeah. Audit. We usually use that word in financial situations like the IRS might audit your finances.

106
00:07:31.660 --> 00:07:34.330
They might look at all your expenses, how much money you made,

107
00:07:34.970 --> 00:07:37.190
How much taxes you owe the government, stuff like that.

108
00:07:37.190 --> 00:07:39.990
They'll do an audit, right? They'll examine your finances.

109
00:07:40.030 --> 00:07:43.270
But in this case, when he says "audit your visual image",

110
00:07:43.270 --> 00:07:46.910
He's really just saying like, examine. That's really the word in this case.

111
00:07:47.580 --> 00:07:54.170
So step one we just listen to the video. But step two we turn the volume all the way down.

112
00:07:54.560 --> 00:07:58.260
We mute the video so we cannot hear it. And we just watch.

113
00:07:59.490 --> 00:08:02.880
Just look at the screen and study your body language, your facial expressions.

114
00:08:03.240 --> 00:08:05.020
Are you fidgeting when you speak?

115
00:08:05.300 --> 00:08:08.340
Are you looking at the camera or are you constantly looking at a bunch of different places?

116
00:08:08.650 --> 00:08:12.370
Do you have a good posture? Do your facial expressions match what you're trying to say?

117
00:08:12.370 --> 00:08:15.550
Do you have the same facial expression the entire time? You know?

118
00:08:15.600 --> 00:08:18.810
Like, all these little details about the way you look when you speak.

119
00:08:18.880 --> 00:08:21.680
Because, again, communication is not just about what you say.

120
00:08:23.340 --> 00:08:24.370
I've heard... I don't know if this is true,

121
00:08:24.370 --> 00:08:29.020
But I've heard many times that the majority of communication is not even verbal, is nonverbal.

122
00:08:30.650 --> 00:08:33.450
It's your posture, it's your facial expressions, it's your gestures,

123
00:08:33.450 --> 00:08:36.320
Your mannerisms, the tone of voice, things that are not verbal.

124
00:08:36.590 --> 00:08:38.140
That's the majority of communication.

125
00:08:38.670 --> 00:08:41.610
Those things heavily influenced the way your words are received.

126
00:08:42.250 --> 00:08:45.140
So it's extremely important to understand these things,

127
00:08:45.140 --> 00:08:48.010
Regardless of what language you're speaking. You understand?

128
00:08:48.490 --> 00:08:52.330
So step number one, examine how you sound.

129
00:08:52.660 --> 00:08:58.520
Step number two, examine what you look like when you're speaking. Okay?

130
00:08:58.520 --> 00:09:02.630
Let's move on to step number three.

131
00:09:02.850 --> 00:09:04.730
Vinh Giang:
Get the video transcribed. Read Highlights.

132
00:09:04.790 --> 00:09:07.940
Bring all your nonwords and filler words to the forefront of your mind.

133
00:09:07.940 --> 00:09:09.950
That's robbing you of clarity every time you talk.

134
00:09:10.120 --> 00:09:12.180
You basically have a mirror in front of you. It's very.

135
00:09:13.460 --> 00:09:18.950
Tony Kaizen:
Okay. So step number three, he said, transcribe the video, which is a good idea,

136
00:09:18.950 --> 00:09:20.760
But I don't know if everyone's going to go that far.

137
00:09:21.190 --> 00:09:25.100
But the idea is to just analyze the words that are being said.

138
00:09:25.100 --> 00:09:26.750
Step one is analyze the sound.

139
00:09:27.270 --> 00:09:28.990
Step two is analyze the look.

140
00:09:29.440 --> 00:09:32.240
Step three is analyze the actual words that were being said.

141
00:09:32.640 --> 00:09:35.850
And he said, in this step or on this step, excuse me.

142
00:09:36.210 --> 00:09:41.560
On this step, what you need to do is identify all the filler words that you use when you're speaking.

143
00:09:41.560 --> 00:09:47.140
Like, um, uh, like... Stuff like that.

144
00:09:48.110 --> 00:09:53.670
All these unnecessary words that you use to fill the silence in between your sentences or your thoughts.

145
00:09:54.680 --> 00:09:58.830
And what he's saying is you're robbing yourself of clarity every time you say "um" or "uh".

146
00:10:00.500 --> 00:10:02.070
That's something that you should pay attention to, bro.

147
00:10:02.070 --> 00:10:04.440
It's not like the most important thing, especially in,

148
00:10:04.440 --> 00:10:10.170
You know, casual conversation or casual communication. Most people don't pay attention to it.

149
00:10:11.060 --> 00:10:13.900
But once you start, it's something that you can never stop paying attention to.

150
00:10:14.390 --> 00:10:18.860
Like, you'll notice the difference between professional speakers and just normal people.

151
00:10:19.230 --> 00:10:25.400
Normal people say, um, ah, like, um, um, all the time, all the fucking time.

152
00:10:25.430 --> 00:10:28.580
And once you start paying attention to it, it actually gets annoying, at least in my experience.

153
00:10:28.870 --> 00:10:31.750
But professional speakers, most of the time, they don't say, "um".

154
00:10:32.200 --> 00:10:39.850
Don't say "ah, hmm, uh, uh" just to fill silence. They're very... What's the word?

155
00:10:40.370 --> 00:10:44.920
Conservative with... Not conservative. They're very economical with their words.

156
00:10:46.700 --> 00:10:50.220
They choose their words carefully. They don't waste energy saying unnecessary things.

157
00:10:51.360 --> 00:10:52.370
And they're okay with silence.

158
00:10:52.370 --> 00:10:54.880
They say what they have to say and then they be quiet and they think.

159
00:10:56.030 --> 00:10:58.890
And so they figure out what they want to say next. You know?

160
00:10:59.740 --> 00:11:06.330
So the point of step number three is to identify how much unnecessary shit you say in between your thoughts

161
00:11:06.770 --> 00:11:11.450
And to eliminate that from your, your, your diction, let's say, from your speech.

162
00:11:13.490 --> 00:11:15.200
It makes a huge difference, bro. I'm telling you.

163
00:11:15.220 --> 00:11:23.770
It makes a huge difference because every time you go, um, uh, ah, it communicates ignorance in a way.

164
00:11:24.150 --> 00:11:27.500
You don't know. I'm not saying you're stupid, but ignorance is like you don't know.

165
00:11:28.300 --> 00:11:31.480
You don't know what you're trying to say. You don't know what you're going to say next.

166
00:11:31.480 --> 00:11:38.020
And you're communicating that every time you say, ah, um, uh... Just communicates ignorance.

167
00:11:38.700 --> 00:11:43.850
And a simple thing you can do literally, literally, one simple thing you can do to sound smarter,

168
00:11:44.100 --> 00:11:49.300
To sound more confident, to sound like you really know what you're talking about is to stop saying things like um and uh,

169
00:11:50.100 --> 00:11:53.300
Just pause and be quiet until you figure out what you want to say next.

170
00:11:53.820 --> 00:11:54.610
There's nothing wrong with that.

171
00:11:55.380 --> 00:11:58.670
And I think a lot of people don't do that because they're afraid that if they pause,

172
00:11:58.940 --> 00:12:02.880
The other person is going to think that they're done talking and the other person will start talking.

173
00:12:02.880 --> 00:12:07.380
You see what I'm saying? And unfortunately, that's something you have no control over.

174
00:12:09.040 --> 00:12:12.810
Unfortunately. But there are ways to make it clear that you're not done talking.

175
00:12:12.810 --> 00:12:16.090
There are ways to do that that we can talk about in other episodes.

176
00:12:16.440 --> 00:12:23.350
But I'm just saying. It will make a huge difference if you can eliminate those filler words from your speech,

177
00:12:24.090 --> 00:12:27.880
Say what you mean, and then shut the fuck up. I'm telling you, it will make a big difference.

178
00:12:28.990 --> 00:12:38.150
So let's summarize. The exercise simply is to record yourself speaking for 5 minutes about any subject.

179
00:12:39.250 --> 00:12:43.640
Once you finish recording, step number one is to do a review of your vocal image.

180
00:12:43.690 --> 00:12:47.640
In other words, review or examine the way you sound when you speak.

181
00:12:48.730 --> 00:12:51.720
And what do you like or dislike? What can be improved? Right?

182
00:12:52.130 --> 00:12:56.690
Step number two, examine the visual image when you speak.

183
00:12:57.040 --> 00:13:00.020
So turn the sound all the way down. Don't listen and just watch yourself.

184
00:13:00.020 --> 00:13:03.740
What do you do when you're speaking? What's your body language like?

185
00:13:03.770 --> 00:13:06.250
What gestures do you make? Your facial expressions, all that.

186
00:13:07.050 --> 00:13:09.790
What do you like or dislike? What can be improved? Right?

187
00:13:10.490 --> 00:13:17.550
Number three, read the words that you said during the video and highlight all the unnecessary things that you say,

188
00:13:17.550 --> 00:13:22.250
All the filler words that you say all the time, and eliminate that from your speech.

189
00:13:24.010 --> 00:13:25.860
And like Vinh said at the end of the video,

190
00:13:25.860 --> 00:13:29.250
You basically have a mirror in front of you because you're looking at yourself

191
00:13:29.250 --> 00:13:31.340
And you're examining yourself the same way you do in the mirror.

192
00:13:31.340 --> 00:13:37.950
And now you can identify what needs to be improved or changed so that you have better communication skills,

193
00:13:37.950 --> 00:13:41.880
So that you communicate more effectively in any language. This isn't about English.

194
00:13:43.480 --> 00:13:45.530
English is a language. Communication is a skill.

195
00:13:45.970 --> 00:13:50.950
We're talking about the skill of communicating with the tool that is language. You feel me?

196
00:13:52.290 --> 00:13:54.220
So I've said this before, man, and I'll say it again.

197
00:13:54.220 --> 00:13:58.140
Communication is at the heart of everything we do and everything we want in life.

198
00:13:59.190 --> 00:14:03.260
Without good communication skills, your life will always be harder than it needs to be.

199
00:14:04.400 --> 00:14:08.010
When it comes to your English, if you never practice, you will never improve. You know that.

200
00:14:09.070 --> 00:14:12.560
If you never critique your communication style or fix your communication problems,

201
00:14:12.560 --> 00:14:15.310
Then you'll end up forming bad communication habits.

202
00:14:16.200 --> 00:14:19.400
And we all know the longer you maintain a habit, the harder it is to break.

203
00:14:20.880 --> 00:14:21.880
So why not get started right now?

204
00:14:22.650 --> 00:14:26.970
Why not record yourself speaking for just 5 minutes and figure out what needs to be improved?

205
00:14:28.090 --> 00:14:32.030
Why not get in the habit of practicing good communication as soon as possible?

206
00:14:33.570 --> 00:14:37.800
I guarantee that if you do this exercise every single day for the next month,

207
00:14:37.800 --> 00:14:43.030
You will see an improvement in your ability to express yourself in any language.

208
00:14:45.520 --> 00:14:49.090
So, my friend, I want to thank you so much for your time and your attention.

209
00:14:49.090 --> 00:14:50.310
I hope you enjoyed this episode.

210
00:14:50.590 --> 00:14:52.320
This is Life in English.

211
00:14:52.410 --> 00:14:55.280
I'm your host, Tony Kaizen. And I'll talk to you later.

212
00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:56.270
Peace!

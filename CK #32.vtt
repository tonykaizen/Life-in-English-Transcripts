00:00:00.930 --> 00:00:04.720
Coffee with Kaizen number 32. The nature of a community.

2
00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:10.290
Comuni... why is it so hard to say that word, bro? Community.

3
00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:16.250
Community. Jesus. Community, I should say like a Brit. Community.

4
00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:19.770
Anyway, what's up, my friend? This is Coffee with Kaizen number 32.

5
00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:21.620
I'm your host, Tony Kaizen.

6
00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:26.860
In this episode, I want to talk to you about the nature of a community.

7
00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:29.890
Got it that time. Let's do it.

8
00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:43.900
All right. I've been listening to a lot of podcasts about

9
00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:46.560
Running a membership business and how one of the most valuable

10
00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:49.940
Parts of a community-based membership is the community itself.

11
00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:54.060
Like in the case of the Life in English community, of course, the podcast,

12
00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:58.240
The transcripts, and vocabulary guides are valuable to anyone trying to learn more English.

13
00:00:58.990 --> 00:01:03.900
But the community of real people who want to have real conversations is the most important part.

14
00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:09.600
All the content in the world just isn't very valuable if you're not going to put it into practice. Right?

15
00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:14.700
One thing I've learned since I started this community is that getting a community

16
00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:18.310
Of strangers to engage with each other is a lot harder than one might think.

17
00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:22.980
Because you can't force an interaction. You can't force energy.

18
00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.650
You can't force a friendship. You can't force connection, right?

19
00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:31.720
So it can be a real challenge to try to incentivize,

20
00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:36.780
Incentivize people to do what we all know they want to do, but maybe don't know how to do.

21
00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:43.030
I'll be honest, in the beginning, I was getting discouraged by the fact that a large

22
00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:45.990
Part of the community wasn't interacting on Discord at all.

23
00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:50.240
I thought to myself that maybe I wasn't doing enough to create an environment

24
00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:53.360
In which people wanted to interact and participate in discussions.

25
00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:56.000
Or maybe I was just doing it in the wrong way, you know?

26
00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:02.770
But I was listening to this podcast episode about something called the 90-9-1 principle.

27
00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:06.230
This principle states that in any given community,

28
00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:10.060
Only about 1% of the members will be what they call "power users".

29
00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:15.560
In other words, only 1% of the community will be the type of people who are always active,

30
00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:19.510
Always starting conversations, always asking questions, and engaging with the community.

31
00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:26.060
Now, about 9% of the community will be the type of people who are moderately active.

32
00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:30.370
They might engage with the community a few times a week. You know?

33
00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:34.590
They might not start conversations, but they will participate if someone else starts a conversation.

34
00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:40.070
And that leaves us with the remaining 90% of the community,

35
00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:42.920
And we can call this group of people "the lurkers".

36
00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:46.720
And you might be asking yourself, what the fuck is a lurker?

37
00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:52.740
Well, a lurker is someone who lurks, and to lurk in the literal sense means

38
00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:57.870
To be or remain hidden so as to wait in ambush for someone or something.

39
00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:00.810
And maybe that doesn't make much sense. So let me give you an example.

40
00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:05.650
Think of a lion stalking its prey, a gazelle, or something like that.

41
00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:11.020
The lion might wait and hide behind some bushes or in some tall grass,

42
00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:15.200
Just observing and waiting for the perfect moment to attack its prey.

43
00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:17.690
We call that lurking.

44
00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:23.940
So the lion is lurking in the tall grass hidden from the gazelles, you know, field of view.

45
00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:29.930
And just waiting for that perfect moment, just observing. He's lurking. Okay?

46
00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:36.030
And many animals and people will lurk in the shadows just waiting to attack, right?

47
00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:41.370
Now, but in the context of an online forum or community or something like that,

48
00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:47.420
Lurking means to read the postings in an internet forum without actively contributing.

49
00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:51.660
So basically, let's think about the Discord server.

50
00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:55.290
A lurker is somebody who's online quite a bit,

51
00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:59.650
But they're just reading all the messages that everyone else is sending.

52
00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:02.190
They never send their own messages or interact with anyone.

53
00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:07.040
They're just kind of... Not necessarily hidden. But you get the idea.

54
00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:08.570
They're there, but we can't see them.

55
00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:12.070
We don't know that they're actually there and they're just lurking.

56
00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:17.970
And for better or for worse, that's just usually about 90% of any given community.

57
00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:23.780
Lurkers. Some people are shy or lack of confidence to speak up in a conversation.

58
00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:27.640
Other people are content just reading or listening to a conversation in silence

59
00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:30.720
Because they still learn so much from other people's interactions,

60
00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:33.620
And maybe one day they'll decide to join a conversation.

61
00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:35.750
But they're fine just observing for now.

62
00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:40.170
And regardless of the reasons, the fact of the matter is that there will always be

63
00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:45.380
A large part of any community who simply don't interact with the community.

64
00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:49.000
Now, you might be wondering why I'm even telling you this.

65
00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:53.130
Well, it's because you're a member of this community and we're both learning and growing together.

66
00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:56.930
So whenever I learn something interesting and useful to know, I like to share it with you.

67
00:04:56.930 --> 00:05:03.140
And maybe you notice that only a small part of the community is regularly active and you had the same question as me.

68
00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:09.020
Why would somebody pay to be part of something and then not take part in that thing?

69
00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:14.040
And now you should have your answer. It's just the nature of a community.

70
00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:19.610
And when you think about a pro basketball team or a pro soccer team, it's the same thing.

71
00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:23.540
You have a percentage of people who are super fans.

72
00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:26.720
They go to every game, no matter how far it is from home.

73
00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:30.410
They buy the new jerseys every year. They paint their faces on game day.

74
00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:32.350
They're always talking about their team.

75
00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:37.670
Then you got people who are just fans. Normal fans.

76
00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:42.170
But they're not going to go out of their way to watch every game or go to every game.

77
00:05:42.530 --> 00:05:45.740
They're not going to buy a new jersey every single year. You know?

78
00:05:45.950 --> 00:05:47.130
They want to see their team win,

79
00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:50.620
But their day won't be ruined if the team loses. You see what I'm saying?

80
00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:54.960
And finally, you got the rest. The ones that consider themselves fans,

81
00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:58.340
But they don't really know what's happening with the team on a day-to-day basis.

82
00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:00.990
They don't know about the new coaches or players joining the team.

83
00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:03.510
They don't own any jerseys or go to any games,

84
00:06:03.510 --> 00:06:08.560
But they still have love for this particular team. That's just the way it is.

85
00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:12.560
So bringing your attention back to the Life in English community,

86
00:06:13.090 --> 00:06:16.220
Just understand that there will always be people who join with good intentions

87
00:06:16.270 --> 00:06:19.500
But simply don't interact with us very much, and that's okay.

88
00:06:20.540 --> 00:06:25.830
Some people just need more time than others to find the motivation to step outside their comfort zones and engage with people.

89
00:06:26.590 --> 00:06:31.860
So don't be confused by the fact that a lot of people will never get on Discord to interact or contribute to conversations.

90
00:06:32.410 --> 00:06:35.720
It's completely normal. And that's why my main focus right now,

91
00:06:35.780 --> 00:06:39.030
Aside from making more interesting podcast episodes and learning materials,

92
00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:43.100
Is creating a welcoming, relaxed environment that people are happy to be a part of.

93
00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:47.520
Because there will always be people who end up leaving the community. That's normal.

94
00:06:48.420 --> 00:06:51.150
But whenever they leave, I want it to be for personal reasons

95
00:06:51.180 --> 00:06:54.720
And not because something was missing from the community experience. You know what I'm saying?

96
00:06:55.680 --> 00:07:00.700
And speaking of members, I'm also learning more about how to attract the right type of people to the community

97
00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:03.700
Because the community is only as good as its members. Right?

98
00:07:04.750 --> 00:07:10.050
So naturally, as the community grows, that 1% group of power users is going to grow as well.

99
00:07:10.130 --> 00:07:13.750
And that means we'll have more people who are interacting on a regular basis

100
00:07:13.980 --> 00:07:16.410
And that makes the community better for everyone.

101
00:07:18.290 --> 00:07:20.130
So if that's something you'd like to see happening,

102
00:07:20.130 --> 00:07:24.170
Then I encourage you to do your part and be that 1% of power users, man.

103
00:07:24.600 --> 00:07:27.240
Be the type of member that you'd like to see in the community.

104
00:07:27.970 --> 00:07:31.250
Start conversations. Teach us about your culture. Ask questions.

105
00:07:31.620 --> 00:07:33.220
Share the things that you've learned this week.

106
00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:38.320
All these things can make the community richer, more engaging,

107
00:07:38.320 --> 00:07:41.260
More valuable, and more fun to be a part of. You know?

108
00:07:42.670 --> 00:07:45.200
So if you're still with me at this point in the episode,

109
00:07:45.200 --> 00:07:48.360
I'd like to take the time to thank you for your time and attention

110
00:07:48.360 --> 00:07:50.700
And also for being part of this community, man.

111
00:07:51.270 --> 00:07:52.900
We're in the early stages of this project

112
00:07:52.900 --> 00:07:56.140
And that means that you joined at a time in which things are still developing.

113
00:07:56.140 --> 00:08:00.350
And not everyone is cool with investing in a work in progress, right?

114
00:08:00.550 --> 00:08:03.530
Some people just want the finished product, all polished and ready to go.

115
00:08:04.800 --> 00:08:08.560
But you've invested in your education, this community, and in me.

116
00:08:09.840 --> 00:08:12.400
So I'd like to take every opportunity I have to thank you for that.

117
00:08:14.690 --> 00:08:15.920
But that's it for this episode, man.

118
00:08:15.920 --> 00:08:19.580
This is Coffee with Kaizen number 32 in the books.

119
00:08:19.990 --> 00:08:21.830
7I'll talk to you later. Peace!

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.740
What's up, everybody?

2
00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:02.890
You're listening to another episode of Life in English.

3
00:00:02.890 --> 00:00:04.090
I'm your host, Tony Kaizen.

4
00:00:04.090 --> 00:00:10.630
And in this episode, we're going to switch it up just a little bit and play a game called "overrated or underrated".

5
00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:12.330
Roll the intro.

12
00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:43.560
All right, my friend.

13
00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:49.900
So just in case you don't know, the word "overrated" basically means giving too much credit for its quality.

14
00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:53.610
Basically believing or saying that something is better than it actually is.

15
00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:55.860
And "underrated" is just the exact opposite.

16
00:00:55.960 --> 00:01:00.930
This thing or this person is not given enough credit for their qualities or whatever it is.

17
00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:03.860
They're not respected or appreciated or admired enough.

18
00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:10.080
So the game "overrated underrated" is just the game in which we pick a person or a subject, a topic, a thing,

19
00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:16.740
Whatever it is, we ask ourselves, is this thing given too much credit, appreciation, admiration or not enough?

20
00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:21.200
Or is it accurately rated, just the right amount of appreciation is given to it? Right?

21
00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:24.950
So you have overrated, underrated, or accurately rated.

22
00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:32.090
So I was reading this BuzzFeed article about 32 things that might be overrated or underrated and you're supposed to choose.

23
00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:36.920
So I'm going to read those things here. Let you know if I think is overrated or underrated,

24
00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:42.110
And hopefully, you do the same and let me know in the comments or the Discord server or on Instagram or whatever.

25
00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:45.500
Reach out to me however you need to. But that's going to be the episode. All right?

26
00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:47.950
So let's not waste any more time. Let's get right into it.

27
00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:56.170
All right. Number one, pizza. I think pizza is accurately rated, bro.

28
00:01:56.170 --> 00:02:00.270
I mean, it's fucking amazing. People around the world love pizza, all types.

29
00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:03.430
Deep dish, thin crust, pan, hand-tossed.

30
00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:05.920
Like, people put all kinds of toppings on they shit.

31
00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:09.490
Pizza, I think, is accurately rated. I think it gets the right amount of love.

32
00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:13.520
If anything, it doesn't get enough love because pizza is fucking...

33
00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:17.460
It's just one of my favorite foods, so I'm a little biased but accurately rated.

34
00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:19.940
Maybe underrated because it's fucking amazing.

35
00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:23.380
And I'm a... just in case you were wondering, I'm a traditional type of guy.

36
00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:28.940
I like pepperoni and that's it. I like dough, sauce, cheese, pepperoni, and that's it.

37
00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:33.780
I don't put no extra shit like olives and peppers and anchovies and fucking pineapple.

38
00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:38.900
Who puts pineapple on a pizza, bro? Pineapple on a pizza.

39
00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:41.550
Like, what the fuck, bro?

40
00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:42.870
But anyway, I'm not going to get started.

41
00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:45.480
Pizza, accurately rated. Let's move on.

42
00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:57.500
Love. Woof. So underrated, misunders... I think love is misunderstood and underrated.

43
00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:01.570
People don't have a good idea of what love actually is,

44
00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:05.480
And a lot of times people talk about love as if it's just a noun, but it's also a verb.

45
00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:11.120
And I think the verb is super extra, grossly underrated.

46
00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:12.500
Get some more love in your life.

47
00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:14.510
Show some more love to the people in your life.

48
00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:16.150
Love, underrated.

49
00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:25.410
Oral sex. That one is difficult to say, I would say it's...

50
00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:30.650
It depends on who's performing it.

51
00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:40.530
Oral sex can be fucking great. Overrated or underrated, bro.

52
00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:49.550
I'll say it like this, it's underrated because it's really fucking great

53
00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:52.800
And I don't think enough people appreciate that.

54
00:03:52.900 --> 00:04:01.900
But I also think it's overrated in the sense that most people maybe don't have the best technique when doing it.

55
00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:05.850
So then it's just like, "Ah it's really not that great". You know what I mean?

56
00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:11.340
So it's kind of like, subjective. It's underrated and also understudied.

57
00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:17.400
I feel like they need to give classes or something on how to properly perform oral sex.

58
00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:23.210
I'm just saying. So underrated, for sure. Yeah, underrated.

59
00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:26.130
Give your man some more head. Give your girl some more head.

60
00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:30.170
I guarantee you the relationship will be better for it.

61
00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:32.260
All right? Trust me on that.

62
00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:38.950
Avocados. Over fucking rated, bro.

63
00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:41.720
I never really understood why people love avocado so much.

64
00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:44.550
Like, I've had them many times before, and they really don't taste like much.

65
00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:49.530
And maybe I'm not eating them right, but I put them on like breakfast burritos,

66
00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:52.640
I put them in my tacos or, excuse me, my burritos and shit like that.

67
00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:56.460
Like, yeah. I get that they're healthy, but people just be like,

68
00:04:56.500 --> 00:04:58.570
Man, I fucking love avocados.

69
00:04:58.570 --> 00:05:03.280
And I'm like, They don't even taste like anything. So overrated.

70
00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:12.090
A celebrity feuds. Completely overrated.

71
00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:15.370
Who gives a fuck what famous people are fighting about? Who gives a shit?

72
00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:17.310
Overrated. Next.

73
00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:25.810
Taco Bell. Overrated, I think.

74
00:05:26.170 --> 00:05:31.090
Taco Bell is really, really popular here for people that love tacos and burritos and shit like that.

75
00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:36.610
But one of my friend's mothers used to work there, and she said,

76
00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:40.420
If you knew what the meat and the tacos actually was, you would never eat it.

77
00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:41.260
And I don't know if that's true.

78
00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:45.930
But ever since she said that I was like, a little weary. I don't eat Taco Bell anymore.

79
00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:48.250
And Taco Bell, they're not even fucking real tacos, bro.

80
00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:53.100
I guess they're American tacos, but they're not like real tacos. You know what I'm saying?

81
00:05:53.100 --> 00:06:00.180
So overrated. Go to San Diego, go to Houston, go to Miami, New Mexico, Arizona,

82
00:06:00.230 --> 00:06:02.580
Like, somewhere along the southern border of the United States.

83
00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:06.470
Get you some authentic Mexican food, bro. Get some real tacos, bro. All right?

84
00:06:06.470 --> 00:06:07.840
Taco Bell, overrated.

85
00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:14.630
New Year's Eve. Overrated.

86
00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:18.000
I'm a little biased because I don't really celebrate holidays in general.

87
00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:21.180
I think celebrating holidays, overrated. You know?

88
00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:23.700
The type of holidays that happen every year like clockwork,

89
00:06:23.700 --> 00:06:29.610
Like, we're just going to celebrate the new year because it's a new year when really it's just another day. You know?

90
00:06:29.610 --> 00:06:32.980
Let's get drunk and get fucked up and party and "whoa another year".

91
00:06:34.230 --> 00:06:36.490
Like, I don't really think this way anymore,

92
00:06:36.490 --> 00:06:38.830
But I used to think like it's just another year closer to death.

93
00:06:38.830 --> 00:06:41.010
What the fuck are we celebrating for? You know what I'm saying?

94
00:06:41.010 --> 00:06:44.490
Obviously, other people look at it like it's another year lived, and that's a blessing.

95
00:06:45.490 --> 00:06:47.540
But like celebrating on New Year's Eve, who gives a fuck?

96
00:06:47.540 --> 00:06:50.910
Just another day. I look at life like just one long timeline.

97
00:06:52.060 --> 00:06:57.190
And the years and days and months and all that type of stuff helped us keep track of our history and everything that happens.

98
00:06:57.190 --> 00:07:02.220
But it's just one line of time, so... New Year's Eve, overrated.

99
00:07:05.770 --> 00:07:11.210
Everyone's obsession with bacon. I feel like that's accurately rated bacon is fucking delicious.

100
00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:16.530
It's really not good for you. And I eat turkey bacon nowadays, I don't eat pork no more.

101
00:07:17.180 --> 00:07:22.230
But bacon is fucking delicious. I feel like being obsessed with bacon is the natural thing to do.

102
00:07:22.230 --> 00:07:24.710
After you try it, how could you not want more?

103
00:07:25.040 --> 00:07:28.470
Especially Americans, we put bacon and cheese on fucking everything, so...

104
00:07:29.250 --> 00:07:30.790
And for good reason because they're both delicious.

105
00:07:30.790 --> 00:07:32.270
So I feel like that's accurately rated.

106
00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:40.760
Libraries, super fucking underrated, bro. Super underrated.

107
00:07:40.760 --> 00:07:44.970
Get the fuck out of here. First of all, reading is underrated. Books are underrated.

108
00:07:45.350 --> 00:07:50.890
But the library itself is such a peaceful place to be almost always quiet. You know what I'm saying?

109
00:07:51.120 --> 00:07:55.500
The cute intellectual girls be in there, reading they nonfiction and shit. You know what I'm saying?

110
00:07:55.500 --> 00:08:00.220
The library is dope. It's literally just a building packed with information.

111
00:08:01.130 --> 00:08:03.850
It's like the internet before we had the internet,

112
00:08:03.850 --> 00:08:06.220
That's where you would go to get information. Right? The fucking library.

113
00:08:06.900 --> 00:08:08.710
So yeah, it's a cool place.

114
00:08:08.980 --> 00:08:13.420
Some people like to go to coffee shops to read and get work done and have their fucking latte and all that shit.

115
00:08:13.730 --> 00:08:16.480
I like to go to the library where it's like, dead quiet.

116
00:08:16.480 --> 00:08:21.500
You could hear a pin drop in that bitch and just get work done. You know?

117
00:08:22.320 --> 00:08:26.730
So, library is underrated. Even today, underrated.

118
00:08:30.410 --> 00:08:35.130
Recording concerts with your iPhone camera. Super fucking overrated, bro.

119
00:08:35.130 --> 00:08:38.600
Put your goddamn phone down and experience the concert, that's what you came for.

120
00:08:39.130 --> 00:08:42.030
I never really understood... I've done it before, so I shouldn't say I've never understood.

121
00:08:42.410 --> 00:08:44.850
I've held my phone up to get a 30-second clip,

122
00:08:44.850 --> 00:08:48.290
A minute clip of the concert to have the memory of being there and all that type of stuff.

123
00:08:48.880 --> 00:08:53.500
But like to watch the whole concert on your phone when it's really right there in front of you,

124
00:08:53.500 --> 00:08:57.350
You're just making sure you get everything in frame, your whole memory is of you looking at your phone.

125
00:08:58.780 --> 00:09:02.200
Like, put the phone down and watch the show.

126
00:09:02.750 --> 00:09:05.410
You paid money to be here to see a live show and you're watching it

127
00:09:05.410 --> 00:09:08.330
As if you're at home watching it on TV or your phone or something like that.

128
00:09:08.710 --> 00:09:13.110
Overrated. Be present, be there in the moment, and just enjoy the shit.

129
00:09:13.110 --> 00:09:15.320
A couple of pictures, a couple of videos, for sure.

130
00:09:15.400 --> 00:09:18.020
We got to remember it. That's valuable.

131
00:09:18.020 --> 00:09:20.470
But like, the whole show just got your phone up?

132
00:09:20.470 --> 00:09:24.930
Like, Yeah, I'm going to love watching this video later. You know what I'm saying?

133
00:09:25.090 --> 00:09:26.770
Overrated. Put your fucking phone down.

134
00:09:30.700 --> 00:09:39.010
Going to brunch. I guess accurately rated. I don't, I don't know.

135
00:09:40.410 --> 00:09:43.590
I like brunch because you don't have to get up so early.

136
00:09:43.770 --> 00:09:48.020
I don't like eating early in the morning. I can't eat breakfast first thing in the morning.

137
00:09:48.020 --> 00:09:51.960
Like, I wake up, I might drink some coffee or Red Bull or some water, but.

138
00:09:51.960 --> 00:09:58.050
I'm not going to eat like a real breakfast until at least like 10:00 a.m. You know what I'm saying?

139
00:09:58.160 --> 00:10:01.610
So brunch like 10:30 11:00 a.m. That's perfect because I can wake up,

140
00:10:01.610 --> 00:10:03.240
Start my day, and then we go get something to eat.

141
00:10:03.690 --> 00:10:05.720
And brunch is cool because it's breakfast or lunch.

142
00:10:05.720 --> 00:10:08.970
You want a burger at 11 o'clock? Who cares? It's 11. You know?

143
00:10:08.970 --> 00:10:11.200
Nobody's fucking side-eyeing you and shit. Like, Really bro?

144
00:10:11.600 --> 00:10:16.230
You order a burger at 8 a.m. and motherfuckers are like, Damn bro, really? Really?

145
00:10:16.680 --> 00:10:19.390
You know? But 11 o'clock, it's cool. Get breakfast or lunch.

146
00:10:20.300 --> 00:10:23.090
So, yeah, it's cool. Depends on who you go with.

147
00:10:23.680 --> 00:10:25.220
But I guess accurately rated.

148
00:10:28.910 --> 00:10:37.010
Listening to the radio. Overrated. Today I think it's overrated.

149
00:10:37.710 --> 00:10:42.020
I say that because since I was a kid, the radio has always played trash music.

150
00:10:42.340 --> 00:10:44.900
They just play the same few hit songs again and again and again when

151
00:10:44.900 --> 00:10:50.600
There's so many dope artists out there that should be on the radio for other people to hear.

152
00:10:51.340 --> 00:10:54.650
Or they talk over the songs, the DJ is like talking while the song is playing,

153
00:10:54.650 --> 00:10:58.620
And he's mixing two records that don't mesh well and all that type of shit. You know what I'm saying?

154
00:10:58.620 --> 00:11:02.990
And there's so many ads in commercials that like, I listen to the radio to hear music.

155
00:11:02.990 --> 00:11:05.740
And if it's talk radio, I want to hear people talking about something interesting, right?

156
00:11:06.110 --> 00:11:11.460
But all radio has just turned into talk radio, advertisements, and wack-ass DJs, in my humble opinion.

157
00:11:12.040 --> 00:11:15.100
So luckily, we have the internet now and you can essentially do the same thing.

158
00:11:15.100 --> 00:11:19.600
A podcast is just a radio show, prerecorded. You know what I'm saying?

159
00:11:20.590 --> 00:11:24.530
We have like a bunch of channels where you can listen to dope music and stuff like that,

160
00:11:24.920 --> 00:11:29.610
Whenever, however you want. So today, unfortunately, the radio is a little overrated.

161
00:11:30.680 --> 00:11:34.780
If it went... Like, the radio and MTV, I'm mentioning that for a reason.

162
00:11:34.780 --> 00:11:39.320
Like, MTV stands for Music Television, and that's the only thing that you never see on MTV anymore.

163
00:11:39.610 --> 00:11:45.950
So if the radio and MTV could go back to what they were meant to be, they'd be the shit.

164
00:11:46.050 --> 00:11:47.880
But right now, overrated.

165
00:11:51.790 --> 00:11:56.870
Social media. Over fucking rated, bro. That one's easy. So overrated.

166
00:11:57.450 --> 00:11:59.200
Like, there's a lot of positives about social media,

167
00:11:59.280 --> 00:12:02.000
All the things you can learn and people you can connect with and all that type of stuff.

168
00:12:02.040 --> 00:12:08.740
But the rest, like, you know, what I realize is the less time I spend on social media, the happier I am.

169
00:12:08.740 --> 00:12:12.160
And I'm not even one of those type of people that see somebody more successful and like,

170
00:12:12.160 --> 00:12:13.620
Shit, I feel terrible about myself.

171
00:12:13.620 --> 00:12:15.690
Or I see a dude that looks better than me, and I'm like,

172
00:12:15.690 --> 00:12:19.440
Fuck, I'm ugly. I'll never... I don't think that way, even when I see that online.

173
00:12:19.440 --> 00:12:23.430
I'm not saying that's the reason I'm happier, because that stuff doesn't really affect me like that.

174
00:12:23.720 --> 00:12:28.150
I guess I'm just happier because I'm not constantly consuming random information for no reason,

175
00:12:28.150 --> 00:12:32.460
Just filling my head with a bunch of useless information. You know what I'm saying?

176
00:12:32.870 --> 00:12:36.430
I'm happy for that reason. I'm not just always consuming some shit.

177
00:12:36.430 --> 00:12:39.930
Just put my phone down and just be here in the real world, so much better.

178
00:12:40.700 --> 00:12:41.610
Social media is dope.

179
00:12:42.780 --> 00:12:45.240
I mean, you're probably listening to me right now because you found me on social media.

180
00:12:45.300 --> 00:12:49.300
That's fucking awesome. But it's overrated, for sure.

181
00:12:53.080 --> 00:13:00.470
Cats and those who obsess over their prowess. That one's tough.

182
00:13:00.550 --> 00:13:04.570
I feel like in the cat community, people that just love cats, cats are overrated.

183
00:13:05.470 --> 00:13:09.510
But people that hate cats, in that community, it's like underrated.

184
00:13:09.510 --> 00:13:12.150
I think cats are like, accurately rated.

185
00:13:14.160 --> 00:13:16.930
If we're being, like, objective about it. Like, cats are fucking dope.

186
00:13:16.930 --> 00:13:19.210
They're not everything that cat lovers make them seem to be,

187
00:13:19.210 --> 00:13:22.870
But they're also not as horrible as cat haters and dog lovers make them seem.

188
00:13:22.870 --> 00:13:25.070
They're somewhere in the middle. Cats are fucking dope, man.

189
00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:30.100
I don't understand how you can love dogs and hate cats. Or love cats and hate dogs.

190
00:13:30.100 --> 00:13:30.930
I never understood that.

191
00:13:31.040 --> 00:13:33.450
Oh I'm a dog person. I'm a cat person.

192
00:13:33.450 --> 00:13:38.350
What the fuck does that mean? And why is it just those two?

193
00:13:38.350 --> 00:13:44.620
Like you love animals, just not cats specifically. The fuck? It's weird. It was always weird to me.

194
00:13:44.770 --> 00:13:46.320
You love animals, you just hate dogs.

195
00:13:46.320 --> 00:13:48.550
I'm a cat person. I prefer cats, I don't like dogs.

196
00:13:51.710 --> 00:13:57.050
Anyway, cats accurately rated, in my opinion. They're fucking dope.

197
00:13:58.470 --> 00:14:03.270
The little sneaky assholes too, but they're fucking dope at the same time. So accurately rated.

198
00:14:08.090 --> 00:14:14.370
Ignoring phone calls. Man, man... Underrated bro. Underrated.

199
00:14:14.760 --> 00:14:18.040
Ignoring phone calls, ignoring text messages. Not even necessarily ignoring,

200
00:14:18.040 --> 00:14:23.300
But like, not answering at the moment it arrives. You know what I'm saying?

201
00:14:24.420 --> 00:14:31.840
Because a lot of times we have this habit of stopping whatever we're doing to attend to the message or the phone call.

202
00:14:32.310 --> 00:14:34.150
We keep our phone right with us at all times,

203
00:14:34.150 --> 00:14:38.590
Most of us do and we could be getting good work done on the computer and "Trrrim" the phone rings

204
00:14:38.590 --> 00:14:42.920
Or "Buzz" you get that text message, you stop completely what you're doing to see what it is. You just have to see.

205
00:14:43.550 --> 00:14:47.160
Bro, I'm telling you, if you want more peace in life, more clarity in your thinking,

206
00:14:47.920 --> 00:14:53.770
More time for yourself, less unexpected interruptions, leave your phone alone.

207
00:14:54.210 --> 00:14:56.570
You don't have to answer the phone call just because it's coming right now.

208
00:14:56.760 --> 00:15:00.590
If you're doing something else, or even if you're doing nothing, you want to keep doing nothing,

209
00:15:01.400 --> 00:15:02.720
Don't answer the phone call. Call them later.

210
00:15:03.900 --> 00:15:08.080
If it's urgent, if it's really serious, they'll more than likely call more than once,

211
00:15:08.080 --> 00:15:11.810
Or they'll send you a text message when you didn't answer, or they'll leave a voicemail or something.

212
00:15:12.300 --> 00:15:17.160
If it's not seriously important, if it's not an emergency, something that needs your attention right now,

213
00:15:17.720 --> 00:15:19.710
They're probably just going to call and that'll be the end of it.

214
00:15:20.560 --> 00:15:23.300
They really needed to talk to you, they would try harder, I think.

215
00:15:23.670 --> 00:15:25.130
I don't know. Obviously, everyone's different.

216
00:15:25.130 --> 00:15:27.390
But I'm just saying, most of the time it's not an emergency.

217
00:15:27.900 --> 00:15:29.670
It's something that can be dealt with later.

218
00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:33.260
Same thing with text messages, like, just because you feel your phone vibrate doesn't mean you have

219
00:15:33.260 --> 00:15:36.620
To take your phone out of your pocket right now to see what it is. You know?

220
00:15:38.150 --> 00:15:40.370
So stop... I'm not telling you what to do, but I'm just saying,

221
00:15:40.370 --> 00:15:46.800
My experience when I stopped allowing my phone to interrupt, I flow just the way I move through my day.

222
00:15:47.800 --> 00:15:50.810
The phone can very easily interrupt that flow, constantly stopping you,

223
00:15:50.810 --> 00:15:54.010
You constantly have to stop and look down at your phone and check.. and Y on the phone.

224
00:15:54.010 --> 00:15:58.220
And then this new idea, problem, situation, is now clouding your mind when you were focused on something else.

225
00:15:58.220 --> 00:16:05.100
It happens all the time. So many distractions. When you eliminate those distractions, it's just like, bliss.

226
00:16:05.130 --> 00:16:10.250
Like, yeah. Like, having your... When your mind is clear, you ever experienced that?

227
00:16:10.940 --> 00:16:15.740
When it's just like, there's nothing going on up there. It's just. Clear.

228
00:16:16.280 --> 00:16:19.420
The less I interact with my phone, the more clear I am up here.

229
00:16:20.270 --> 00:16:26.270
So ignoring phone calls and messages or just leaving them for later, super underrated.

230
00:16:27.510 --> 00:16:28.970
Control your phone, don't let it control you.

231
00:16:33.920 --> 00:16:38.220
S'mores. Fucking overrated, bro.

232
00:16:38.270 --> 00:16:45.120
Just in case you don't know what s'mores are. S ' M O R E S, which is like a contraction of "some more".

233
00:16:45.640 --> 00:16:50.440
So I want s'mores. I want some more. If I'm not mistaken, that's what the name means.

234
00:16:51.190 --> 00:16:53.780
S'MORES is s'mores, some more.

235
00:16:54.450 --> 00:17:00.050
Anyway, s'mores are what you see like in those typical American movies where they go camping

236
00:17:00.650 --> 00:17:06.470
And they put a marshmallow on a stick and they melt it and then they put it in between two graham crackers

237
00:17:06.470 --> 00:17:12.700
And two pieces of chocolate and the hot marshmallow melts the chocolate and then you eat it like a chocolate marshmallow sandwich, I guess.

238
00:17:13.330 --> 00:17:16.190
Those are s'mores. And I think they're grossly overrated.

239
00:17:16.190 --> 00:17:20.020
They're really not even that good. I'm not the biggest fan of chocolate, though.

240
00:17:20.050 --> 00:17:24.490
Like, I prefer fruity flavors like strawberry and mango, and pineapple. I prefer candy.

241
00:17:25.050 --> 00:17:25.930
I'm not much of a chocolate guy.

242
00:17:26.860 --> 00:17:33.600
But s'mores themselves like, nothing special. Overrated. Yeah.

243
00:17:38.440 --> 00:17:40.830
Going commando and letting your genitals breathe.

244
00:17:42.510 --> 00:17:45.530
For those of you that don't know, going commando means not wearing any underwear.

245
00:17:46.590 --> 00:17:48.540
So that's what they mean when they say, "Let your genitals breathe".

246
00:17:48.540 --> 00:17:52.160
Let your genitals, let them breathe.

247
00:17:53.910 --> 00:17:58.850
So instead of wearing boxers or briefs or panties or whatever you wear, you just wear nothing under your pants.

248
00:17:59.330 --> 00:18:05.540
That's what it means to go commando. So I feel like that's overrated, to be honest.

249
00:18:06.630 --> 00:18:09.320
I think you should wear... you should wear some drawers, you should wear some underwear.

250
00:18:09.320 --> 00:18:13.740
I guess it depends on the person.

251
00:18:13.740 --> 00:18:18.420
But lik,e even like if I'm not wearing boxers and my dick is just rubbing up against my jeans,

252
00:18:18.420 --> 00:18:22.360
Like, Nah, it doesn't feel good. You know?

253
00:18:22.360 --> 00:18:25.700
And the boxes, they give you support. Right? They support the fruit of the Loom.

254
00:18:26.930 --> 00:18:31.320
Right? So, going commando, overrated.

255
00:18:35.110 --> 00:18:43.130
Putting sad music on while you're sad to further your sadness. Overrated, I think.

256
00:18:43.460 --> 00:18:47.980
I've never been the type of person like to... that's a lie, I am.

257
00:18:48.700 --> 00:18:54.000
I've listened to sad music when I was sad before, but not to further my sadness.

258
00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:55.400
It's more like, as a cure.

259
00:18:56.130 --> 00:18:58.270
Because the type of sad music I listen to isn't really sad,

260
00:18:58.270 --> 00:19:03.650
But this person's going through some fucked up shit and they're talking about it in a way that I can identify with,

261
00:19:03.650 --> 00:19:05.100
And for some reason that makes me feel better.

262
00:19:06.220 --> 00:19:09.270
But I don't listen to sad music to further my sadness. That's fucking weird.

263
00:19:09.270 --> 00:19:12.660
I think that's overrated because although I think feeling sad is necessary.

264
00:19:14.160 --> 00:19:19.200
It's necessary to feel your feelings. I don't want to just feel sad.

265
00:19:19.360 --> 00:19:21.050
So why would I try to further my sadness?

266
00:19:22.940 --> 00:19:24.420
In the past, that's probably something I would have done,

267
00:19:24.540 --> 00:19:27.780
But today, right now, fuck that. Overrated.

268
00:19:32.150 --> 00:19:36.640
Reading books. This one kind of is like the library. Super-duper extra underrated.

269
00:19:37.050 --> 00:19:39.980
And when I say reading books, it could also be just listening to audiobooks.

270
00:19:39.980 --> 00:19:44.390
That's also an option. It's much faster, much more practical. I prefer it.

271
00:19:44.710 --> 00:19:47.590
I hate reading books, but I love the information I get from books.

272
00:19:47.630 --> 00:19:48.450
I don't know if that makes sense.

273
00:19:48.780 --> 00:19:51.780
But like, sitting down to actually read line after line, I hate that shit.

274
00:19:52.270 --> 00:19:56.030
Getting the information from the book is the best part, and that's why I read.

275
00:19:56.460 --> 00:19:57.970
So audiobooks are the perfect solution.

276
00:19:57.970 --> 00:20:03.000
You can just listen to a 300-page book in like a day or a couple of days

277
00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:05.440
Where it would take you a week or two weeks to read it. You see what I'm saying?

278
00:20:06.050 --> 00:20:09.660
But anyway, reading books, getting valuable information from books,

279
00:20:10.290 --> 00:20:14.310
Especially non-fiction books, super-duper extra underrated.

280
00:20:15.690 --> 00:20:18.200
I feel like... The reason people don't do it more is just because it's boring.

281
00:20:18.200 --> 00:20:19.740
Reading a book is really, really boring.

282
00:20:19.740 --> 00:20:25.450
Especially if it's nonfiction or something that you're not fascinated by. You know what I'm saying?

283
00:20:26.260 --> 00:20:27.410
I think that's why most people don't do it.

284
00:20:27.410 --> 00:20:31.370
It's just easier to watch a video or scroll or listen to music or whatever it is.

285
00:20:31.400 --> 00:20:37.740
But like... I'm telling you, man, everything that has ever been known or done is somewhere in a book.

286
00:20:40.650 --> 00:20:43.970
Like, there's nothing new under the sun, so the problem that you're dealing with,

287
00:20:43.970 --> 00:20:49.220
Somebody wrote about it in a book at some point. Guaranteed. Guaranteed.

288
00:20:49.220 --> 00:20:53.180
What you want to achieve in life, somebody wrote about it in a book at some point. Guaranteed.

289
00:20:53.770 --> 00:20:59.070
What you're going through, what you're feeling, experiencing, information on how to deal with it is somewhere in a book.

290
00:20:59.770 --> 00:21:02.150
You need more money, learn about it in the book.

291
00:21:02.570 --> 00:21:09.000
Better relationships, how to travel, start a business, it's in a book somewhere.

292
00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:10.990
Now, nowadays it's on YouTube somewhere.

293
00:21:11.850 --> 00:21:16.280
But I'm saying timeless... There's a lot of timeless information that can be applied to anyone,

294
00:21:16.280 --> 00:21:20.020
Anywhere, any time just sitting in books waiting to be discovered.

295
00:21:20.170 --> 00:21:22.650
So reading books, underrated.

296
00:21:27.250 --> 00:21:35.480
Conversing with strangers. Accurately rated. Accurately rated.

297
00:21:35.500 --> 00:21:40.000
I don't think it's under or over... I don't think it's under or overrated.

298
00:21:41.010 --> 00:21:44.310
Because sometimes it's the best thing in the world and like,

299
00:21:44.310 --> 00:21:46.990
You just start a casual conversation and you never know where it's going to go.

300
00:21:47.360 --> 00:21:51.100
You never know what's going to happen. And it turns out that it's the coolest fucking person ever.

301
00:21:51.500 --> 00:21:55.680
Or because you mentioned this one thing, you learned all these other things from this person

302
00:21:55.680 --> 00:21:59.590
In just a random conversation with somebody that you don't even know. That's awesome.

303
00:22:00.060 --> 00:22:04.630
But at the same time. Talking with people in general,

304
00:22:04.630 --> 00:22:13.540
Not just strangers, but people in general sometimes can be such a fucking drag. You know what I mean?

305
00:22:13.540 --> 00:22:17.020
Like it drains so much energy and wastes so much time.

306
00:22:17.050 --> 00:22:20.310
You're like, why did I fucking open my mouth to speak to this person?

307
00:22:20.310 --> 00:22:22.830
So I think it just depends on the person, depends on the day.

308
00:22:22.830 --> 00:22:25.000
I think it's accurately rated.

309
00:22:25.030 --> 00:22:31.580
Sometimes it's great. Other times it's like, not great. So accurately rated.

310
00:22:35.420 --> 00:22:44.300
Flowers. Um. Overrated. I think flowers are overrated.

311
00:22:45.500 --> 00:22:50.150
In the context of like society. In terms of like giving somebody flowers as a gift,

312
00:22:50.150 --> 00:22:53.680
Buying your woman flowers to say like, I love you, I was thinking about you or whatever.

313
00:22:53.680 --> 00:22:57.900
I don't know why people buy flowers for their partners. I don't really understand.

314
00:22:58.840 --> 00:23:00.150
I guess the gesture is the point.

315
00:23:00.150 --> 00:23:04.370
Like, I was thinking about you, I wanted you to have something nice and this flower represents our love,

316
00:23:04.400 --> 00:23:09.200
It's beautiful and it blossoms like the rose in the spring or something like that.

317
00:23:09.200 --> 00:23:11.960
I don't know why people give flowers specifically.

318
00:23:11.960 --> 00:23:15.670
Like, you could give your boyfriend a blowjob. That's better than flowers.

319
00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:18.670
You could give your woman some head. That's better than flowers, I think.

320
00:23:20.630 --> 00:23:25.460
Right? I don't know, I think just giving flowers as a gift is overrated.

321
00:23:26.410 --> 00:23:27.050
I don't understand it.

322
00:23:32.310 --> 00:23:36.070
The plumber plot that precedes the action in many of the world's porn videos.

323
00:23:43.690 --> 00:23:46.220
Accurately rated. That's a good scene.

324
00:23:46.220 --> 00:23:49.920
Like, the plumbers coming through to fix the pipes, and he ends up laying some pipe.

325
00:23:51.130 --> 00:23:52.440
It's a pretty dope fantasy, man.

326
00:23:52.440 --> 00:23:59.180
I can't think of, you know, what would be better, an electrician? I don't know.

327
00:24:00.140 --> 00:24:01.410
Accurately rated. You know?

328
00:24:02.530 --> 00:24:05.760
I like a little story with my porn. So to be able to get into the story like,

329
00:24:05.760 --> 00:24:08.240
Man, she got a bursted of pipe. The basement was going to flush.

330
00:24:08.240 --> 00:24:10.060
She's got to call a plumber, calls the plumber.

331
00:24:10.330 --> 00:24:12.920
He comes through with the tools to fix the pipe. And whaaat?

332
00:24:13.640 --> 00:24:18.290
He brought dick too. Five-star customer service bro.

333
00:24:18.790 --> 00:24:21.130
Five-star customer service. That's what you call that.

334
00:24:21.360 --> 00:24:27.590
So the the the plumber plot before the porn scene. Accurately rated. Got to love it.

335
00:24:29.750 --> 00:24:31.560
All right, man. Now it's your turn.

336
00:24:31.560 --> 00:24:36.470
Go back through, look at each of these topics or people or subjects and let me know which things are overrated,

337
00:24:36.720 --> 00:24:40.270
Which things are underrated or accurately rated in your opinion.

338
00:24:40.270 --> 00:24:43.570
Let's start a conversation, man. I might do more of these in the future because it was kind of fun.

339
00:24:43.570 --> 00:24:47.960
But I don't know if there's any real value here. I was just fucking around.

340
00:24:47.960 --> 00:24:50.300
Hopefully you enjoyed it and got some things to think about.

341
00:24:50.300 --> 00:24:54.160
Because at the end of the day, you could write about each one of these subjects in your journal,

342
00:24:54.160 --> 00:24:56.400
We can talk about it on the Discord server or whatever.

343
00:24:56.400 --> 00:24:58.590
The point is to start a dialogue. You see what I'm saying?

344
00:24:58.590 --> 00:25:03.330
So let me know on the Discord server, shoot me some comments below if you're watching on YouTube.

345
00:25:03.690 --> 00:25:05.270
What do you think is over or underrated?

346
00:25:05.270 --> 00:25:08.920
Or give me some new things to rate in the future. I don't know.

347
00:25:09.180 --> 00:25:10.550
We'll see if this will turn into a thing.

348
00:25:11.200 --> 00:25:15.100
So hopefully you enjoyed the episode, you got a little bit of entertainment for the day. I don't know.

349
00:25:15.200 --> 00:25:16.310
But this is Life in English.

350
00:25:16.390 --> 00:25:18.270
As always, my friend, I'm your host, Tony Kaizen.

351
00:25:18.310 --> 00:25:20.660
And I will talk to you in the next episode.

352
00:25:21.280 --> 00:25:21.720
Peace.

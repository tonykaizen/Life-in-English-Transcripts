00:00:00.049 --> 00:00:00.920
What's up, everybody?

00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:03.469
You're listening to another episode of Life in English.

00:00:03.469 --> 00:00:06.089
I'm your host Tony Kaizen.

00:00:06.439 --> 00:00:10.519
And in this episode, we are talking about the importance of your eyes and your ears.

00:00:16.239 --> 00:00:18.969
Our eyes and our ears are the gateway into our soul.

00:00:18.999 --> 00:00:22.959
What we're looking at and what we're listening to gets into our heart

00:00:22.989 --> 00:00:25.539
and whatever gets into our heart will come out of our mouth.

00:00:25.539 --> 00:00:29.499
And whatever comes out of our mouth is going to come to pass because our words are so powerful.

00:00:29.619 --> 00:00:31.279
What are we feeding ourselves?

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.499
- Right.

00:00:31.499 --> 00:00:37.839
Our heart has been designed by God to be a manufacturing center of whatever seeds we plant in it.

00:00:37.929 --> 00:00:41.179
We have to stop trying to take control of what comes out of our heart.

00:00:41.249 --> 00:00:43.569
We have to take control of what goes into our hearts.

00:00:43.569 --> 00:00:44.239
- That's really good.

00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:49.019
Because then what comes out of our heart is just going to be the harvest of whatever we allow in our heart.

00:00:52.072 --> 00:00:55.862
Man, I really appreciated this video because I think it's something we don't consider enough.

00:00:56.652 --> 00:01:02.682
All of us are constantly in contact with a smartphone, a computer, a TV, a book or a magazine.

00:01:03.372 --> 00:01:06.342
You also have people around you talking about all kinds of different things.

00:01:07.182 --> 00:01:11.862
We're constantly taking in information, constantly consuming.

00:01:12.782 --> 00:01:15.912
Now, just like we need to watch what we consume in terms of food and drinks.

00:01:16.242 --> 00:01:19.752
We need to be very aware of the information we choose to consume as well.

00:01:20.862 --> 00:01:25.552
If I eat nothing but pizza and ice cream and I drink nothing but soda and vodka for the next 10 years,

00:01:25.552 --> 00:01:27.627
I'm going to have a serious health problem.

00:01:28.587 --> 00:01:31.167
If I eat nothing but fruits and vegetables and lean meats,

00:01:31.377 --> 00:01:35.187
and I drink nothing but water for the next 10 years, I'll probably be in good shape.

00:01:36.537 --> 00:01:37.617
So think about your mind.

00:01:38.727 --> 00:01:40.887
It's the most important organ in your body.

00:01:41.967 --> 00:01:46.497
The problem a lot of people have is they think of themselves and their minds as if they were the same thing.

00:01:47.217 --> 00:01:50.067
However, I'm of the opinion that you are not your mind,

00:01:50.547 --> 00:01:54.537
just like a father is not his son and a mother is not her daughter.

00:01:56.132 --> 00:01:59.102
If a child is neglected or allowed to do whatever he wants,

00:01:59.462 --> 00:02:00.902
eat and drink whatever he wants,

00:02:01.112 --> 00:02:04.412
watch whatever he wants, and go wherever he wants all the time,

00:02:04.982 --> 00:02:10.682
there's a good chance that the child will grow up to be a dysfunctional, unproductive member of society.

00:02:11.522 --> 00:02:11.972
Why?

00:02:12.692 --> 00:02:14.232
Because children have no self-control.

00:02:15.152 --> 00:02:17.222
They just want to be happy and do what feels good.

00:02:17.222 --> 00:02:21.242
Now, there's nothing wrong with wanting to be happy and feel good,

00:02:21.662 --> 00:02:28.202
but I hope you can agree with me when I say that the desire to indulge in pleasure must be balanced with self-control and discipline.

00:02:29.522 --> 00:02:30.662
Children need discipline.

00:02:30.992 --> 00:02:35.402
And without that discipline, a child will eat candy for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.

00:02:35.642 --> 00:02:38.192
A child will play video games for 11 hours straight.

00:02:38.432 --> 00:02:42.622
A child will find his way onto a website that's meant for adults only.

00:02:43.352 --> 00:02:47.697
A child will get into a car with a stranger because he's nice and promises her candy.

00:02:49.167 --> 00:02:53.667
That is why we must teach, discipline, and protect our children.

00:02:54.807 --> 00:02:57.807
They're fragile human beings and they learn very quickly.

00:02:58.797 --> 00:03:02.757
And that's why we are very careful about where we let them go and what we let them do

00:03:02.757 --> 00:03:07.887
until they're old enough and educated enough to make reasonable decisions without help from others.

00:03:09.177 --> 00:03:10.597
Well, the same should be true for your mind.

00:03:12.027 --> 00:03:13.317
Now if you're my age or younger,

00:03:13.347 --> 00:03:18.537
your parents probably didn't do a great job with teaching you how to manage your mind,

00:03:19.197 --> 00:03:21.627
control yourself, or plan for the future.

00:03:22.407 --> 00:03:27.957
Now, I say that because it's true for the vast majority of the people I meet that are my age or younger, including myself.

00:03:29.127 --> 00:03:34.797
It just seems like after our parents were raised in such difficult, poor, underprivileged environments and times,

00:03:35.517 --> 00:03:38.157
they decided they didn't want their children to have to experience that.

00:03:38.157 --> 00:03:41.697
So they gave their children everything and let them do whatever they wanted.

00:03:42.837 --> 00:03:46.797
The problem with that is we have a lot more access to the world and everything in it,

00:03:47.307 --> 00:03:49.557
much more than our parents and our grandparents had.

00:03:50.907 --> 00:03:54.327
Although this is an incredible advantage for us if we apply it properly,

00:03:54.957 --> 00:04:00.057
I also think that we're not really meant to know what's going on in the world all day, every day.

00:04:01.332 --> 00:04:05.772
I don't think we're meant to be consuming endless streams of information all the time,

00:04:06.372 --> 00:04:14.142
especially when the information that the majority of people consume is of such low quality or completely false and harmful altogether.

00:04:15.412 --> 00:04:16.422
Now, there are two problems here.

00:04:17.532 --> 00:04:23.182
Number one, if you have too much of it, it becomes less valuable.

00:04:24.542 --> 00:04:26.397
And this is true for everything, not just content.

00:04:26.637 --> 00:04:30.627
And it's especially true when something is just given to you and you don't have to work for it.

00:04:31.827 --> 00:04:35.217
Like when you have two weeks to study for an exam, what do you do?

00:04:36.327 --> 00:04:39.537
You spend 13 days doing whatever the fuck you want to do,

00:04:39.537 --> 00:04:42.777
wasting time, you're on your phone, talking to people, just chilling.

00:04:43.617 --> 00:04:48.867
And then the night before the exam, you're trying to study, cram all that information into your brain,

00:04:49.077 --> 00:04:52.167
hoping that you can remember the next day and pass the exam.

00:04:52.317 --> 00:04:56.187
Because you have two weeks to complete one task, which is study,

00:04:57.057 --> 00:04:58.437
or at least that's the way you think about it.

00:04:58.617 --> 00:05:03.027
So, you know, the time is not valuable to you.

00:05:03.027 --> 00:05:04.167
You have too much of it.

00:05:04.497 --> 00:05:09.177
It's only when you don't have enough time that every moment becomes valuable.

00:05:09.177 --> 00:05:12.837
And then you try to cram two weeks of studying into two hours.

00:05:13.317 --> 00:05:13.767
You see?

00:05:15.072 --> 00:05:18.102
Or when people have more money than they can spend, what do most people do?

00:05:18.822 --> 00:05:22.722
They start to spend it on useless, meaningless bullshit, just because they can.

00:05:23.352 --> 00:05:28.122
If I've got hundreds of thousands or millions of dollars, what is the value of one dollar?

00:05:29.262 --> 00:05:30.492
Now, obviously, there is value.

00:05:30.492 --> 00:05:34.032
It just depends on how you think about it, but hopefully you can understand my example.

00:05:34.212 --> 00:05:37.512
If I have too much money, more than I can spend in a lifetime,

00:05:37.752 --> 00:05:42.082
why would I give a fuck about five dollars, twenty dollars, a hundred dollars?

00:05:42.882 --> 00:05:43.612
I have millions.

00:05:44.392 --> 00:05:48.822
So one just isn't as valuable because I have millions of them, you know?

00:05:49.812 --> 00:05:54.762
Or when somebody has too many different options for a boyfriend or a girlfriend, how do they treat people?

00:05:55.722 --> 00:05:57.912
Like just another option, right?

00:05:58.512 --> 00:05:59.532
I don't give a fuck about you.

00:05:59.532 --> 00:06:01.722
I got eight more girls on my line trying to talk to me.

00:06:01.962 --> 00:06:02.992
I don't give a fuck about you.

00:06:02.992 --> 00:06:04.752
I got fifteen guys trying to get with me.

00:06:05.202 --> 00:06:06.552
So who are you?

00:06:07.272 --> 00:06:08.232
Just another option.

00:06:08.232 --> 00:06:11.982
I don't value you because there's fifteen more of you.

00:06:13.292 --> 00:06:14.237
I have too many options.

00:06:14.237 --> 00:06:15.617
So why would I care about just one?

00:06:16.247 --> 00:06:16.517
Right?

00:06:17.477 --> 00:06:20.777
If you know, there are hundreds of people making the same type of free content,

00:06:21.077 --> 00:06:24.437
how much would you voluntarily pay to watch the content?

00:06:25.997 --> 00:06:30.467
Most likely you wouldn't because there's so much free shit out there for you to watch, right?

00:06:30.797 --> 00:06:35.717
Hundreds of English teachers out there for you to watch, making content, videos, podcasts, whatever.

00:06:36.017 --> 00:06:40.512
Why would you pay for one, when you could go consume all the free stuff?

00:06:40.662 --> 00:06:41.442
You probably wouldn't.

00:06:41.622 --> 00:06:46.452
It would have to be a very, very special teacher or a type of content or video or podcast.

00:06:46.452 --> 00:06:55.872
It would have to be extremely more valuable than all the free stuff that you have at your disposal all day, every day, you know?

00:06:56.622 --> 00:06:58.842
Simple economics, supply and demand, right?

00:06:58.842 --> 00:07:05.712
When there's too much of it, any individual piece of it is just less valuable because there's so much, there's so much.

00:07:06.597 --> 00:07:07.587
So the value drops.

00:07:08.247 --> 00:07:09.417
Simple supply and demand.

00:07:10.187 --> 00:07:16.167
Now, problem number two, when you never take a break from it, you don't have time to consider it.

00:07:17.637 --> 00:07:19.827
Have you ever noticed that when you're scrolling on social media,

00:07:20.067 --> 00:07:24.717
you can watch 50 videos in less than 30 minutes and you won't remember 29 of them?

00:07:26.777 --> 00:07:32.327
Video after video after video, it's just an endless stream of content.

00:07:32.357 --> 00:07:36.777
And as soon as you finish one video, you immediately scroll on to the next one.

00:07:37.737 --> 00:07:41.547
You probably never take the time to process the content you're consuming.

00:07:42.657 --> 00:07:49.617
You're just injecting thought after thought after thought, video after video, and picture after picture into your brain.

00:07:49.827 --> 00:07:52.277
But you're not really thinking about any of it.

00:07:53.377 --> 00:07:57.837
The information still enters your mind, but you never form your own opinion about any of it.

00:07:59.247 --> 00:08:01.227
It's like eating food and not digesting it.

00:08:02.277 --> 00:08:07.402
It goes in one end, and out the other, and none of the nutrients are absorbed.

00:08:08.572 --> 00:08:12.682
So you're walking around with a bunch of other people's thoughts and you have none of your own.

00:08:13.552 --> 00:08:16.012
You're walking around with all these ideas and all this information,

00:08:16.192 --> 00:08:20.602
but you don't even know what you really think about any of it or what you really believe.

00:08:21.872 --> 00:08:27.852
Now, one of the best things about this digital age is the access to the millions of different people and ideas.

00:08:28.962 --> 00:08:32.112
But if you never take a break from the endless stream of content,

00:08:32.352 --> 00:08:37.272
you won't remember any of it, nor will you be able to apply it in your own life.

00:08:37.842 --> 00:08:38.742
And what's the point of that?

00:08:40.422 --> 00:08:46.572
One of the things that makes us different from almost every other animal is our ability to think and to reason.

00:08:48.072 --> 00:08:51.912
And if you're not using your brain to think for yourself, what does that make you?

00:08:53.112 --> 00:08:54.162
Just a herd animal.

00:08:55.197 --> 00:08:56.607
You go where people tell you to go.

00:08:56.997 --> 00:08:58.647
You do what people tell you to do.

00:08:59.067 --> 00:09:00.867
You try to be like everyone else around you.

00:09:02.367 --> 00:09:06.387
I don't know about you, but that doesn't sound like a life worth living to me.

00:09:08.367 --> 00:09:11.667
So remember, you must be careful about what you consume.

00:09:12.747 --> 00:09:16.797
What you see and hear becomes what you think and believe.

00:09:18.177 --> 00:09:22.017
If you don't control your thoughts, someone else certainly will.

00:09:23.477 --> 00:09:23.777
Peace.

00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:33.070
In this episode, I'm going to explain the English phrase "at all".

2
00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:33.080
What's up, my friend? This is Coffee with Kaizen number 17.

3
00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090
And we're going to be talking about the English phrase "at all".

4
00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:33.100
Now, in the last episode number 16, I explained the difference,

5
00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:33.110
or I did my best to explain the difference between the words "everything" and "all".

6
00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120
Immediately after I posted that episode,

7
00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:33.130
I got a lot of questions about the English phrase "at all".

8
00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:33.140
So that's what I'm going to explain to you today.

9
00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:37.870
Now, this phrase really isn't something that you can think about logically

10
00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:41.980
Because on the surface the words at all really don't make any sense.

11
00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:42.760
You know what I'm saying?

12
00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:46.700
It's only when you put them in a complete sentence that they have any real meaning.

13
00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:48.100
Now, there are exceptions.

14
00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:52.510
There are always exceptions in the English language, and do not forget it. All right?

15
00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:56.950
There are some exceptions, some cases in which you can simply say the words at all,

16
00:00:56.980 --> 00:00:58.150
And it would make sense.

17
00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:02.830
But I'll talk about that in a little bit because I don't want to confuse you from the jump

18
00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:06.880
Or from the beginning, you know, right in the beginning of the transmission.

19
00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:08.800
Hopefully, that makes sense. All right?

20
00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:12.770
So first, we use this phrase "at all" in two main ways.

21
00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:15.460
Now, there are more than two ways, there's really three or four.

22
00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:17.790
But I'm going to first explain the two main ways,

23
00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:20.350
The most common ways that you need to learn.

24
00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:26.560
Number one, to put emphasis on negative sentences or, in other words, to make them stronger.

25
00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:28.390
That's how we use the phrase at all.

26
00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:34.930
Number two, to put emphasis on questions when we're trying to see if something is true or not. Okay?

27
00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:42.910
So "at all" really means even a little bit or in any way or even slightly.

28
00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:46.840
And usually we put "at all" at the end of a question or sentence.

29
00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:52.540
However, there are some cases in which we will use "at all" right before an adjective. Okay?

30
00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:55.420
Hopefully, I'm not confusing you. I am going to give you plenty of examples.

31
00:01:55.420 --> 00:02:01.930
So I hope, my goal here is that by the end of the transmission, it'll be clear,

32
00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:04.950
It'll be easier to understand and not harder. You know what I'm saying?

33
00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:06.700
So let's see how this goes.

34
00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:10.450
So let's start with the first way that we use this phrase,

35
00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:14.860
To put emphasis on negative sentences or to make them stronger. H

36
00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:18.400
ere's an example, I don't like him at all.

37
00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:21.830
I don't like him at all. Okay?

38
00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:26.300
So this is a negative phrase. I do not like him at all.

39
00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:28.860
And it would be totally fine if you said, "I don't like him".

40
00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:29.990
There's nothing wrong with that.

41
00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:33.740
However, when you add "at all" to the end of your sentence,

42
00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:37.900
You're just putting emphasis on the fact that you really do not like this person.

43
00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:41.570
I don't like him at all. It's essentially the same thing as saying,

44
00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:44.600
"I don't like him, not even a little bit".

45
00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:50.450
I don't like him even a little bit, not in the slightest. Not at all. Okay?

46
00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:56.720
So when someone says "not at all", they're essentially saying not even a little bit.

47
00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:00.990
Like, 0%. Not 1 or 2, just not at all. All right? I'm sure you get the point.

48
00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:05.060
So here's another example, they're not giving us any money at all.

49
00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:09.280
They're not giving us any money at all. Another negative sentence.

50
00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:13.180
They are not giving us any money, not even a little bit.

51
00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:16.900
Not a single dollar. No money at all. Okay?

52
00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:20.920
Another example, that makes no sense at all.

53
00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:23.800
So maybe I'm explaining this to you right now and you're like,

54
00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:26.440
"Tony, bro, that shit makes no sense at all".

55
00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:29.950
Really what you're saying is that doesn't even make a little bit of sense.

56
00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:34.060
It makes zero sense or absolutely no sense, right?

57
00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:38.550
It makes no sense whatsoever. That's the point. All right?

58
00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:41.700
Another example, you haven't made any effort at all.

59
00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:44.210
You haven't made any effort at all, bro.

60
00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:47.490
And what you're saying is you haven't made the slightest bit of effort.

61
00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:50.220
Not even a little bit. Absolutely no effort.

62
00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:59.100
Another example, I'm not at all tired. I'm not at all tired. I'm not at all tired.

63
00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:03.800
Now, this is an example of putting the phrase before an adjective and not at the end of the sentence.

64
00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:07.790
So you're really just putting emphasis on the fact that you're not even a little bit tired.

65
00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:11.560
That's really what you're saying. So you could say, I'm not tired at all.

66
00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:13.390
And it would literally be the same thing.

67
00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:17.370
So that's something that I don't think you need to pay too much attention to

68
00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:19.050
Or try to learn how to speak that way.

69
00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:24.090
It's just so that you understand most of the time we put "at all" at the end of the sentence.

70
00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:29.370
But there are times when we put it right before an adjective to put emphasis on that adjective. Okay?

71
00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:31.590
It's a little more advanced, so don't worry too much about it.

72
00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:36.060
Now, you can also use this as a response, this phrase "at all",

73
00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:39.360
You can use it as a response when someone asks you a question.

74
00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:44.820
For example, your friend might ask you, "You don't care, do you?".

75
00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:46.140
Like, "Man, you don't care, do you?".

76
00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:47.550
And you can respond by saying,

77
00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:53.640
"No, not at all". Right? No, I don't care, not at all. Not even a little bit.

78
00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:59.220
I don't care in the slightest, whatsoever. You see?

79
00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:01.500
Now, let's talk about the second way we use this phrase,

80
00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:07.080
Which is to put emphasis on questions when we're trying to see if something is true or not true.

81
00:05:07.170 --> 00:05:10.820
Here's an example, has the situation improved at all?

82
00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:18.370
Has the situation improved at all? This question is basically or it's not basically,

83
00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:25.420
It's actually the same thing as asking, has the situation improved even slightly or even a little bit,

84
00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:28.810
or is it exactly the same as it was the last time I asked you?

85
00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:33.850
Has it improved at all? A little bit? To some extent? You see what I'm saying?

86
00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:41.380
Here's another example, do you love me at all? Do you love me at all?

87
00:05:41.380 --> 00:05:43.960
Do you? Do you love me at all?

88
00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:47.500
So what you're asking in that question is, do you love me even a little bit?

89
00:05:47.530 --> 00:05:51.580
Do you love me to any extent? Right? Do you love me even slightly?

90
00:05:52.090 --> 00:05:54.040
That's the idea here. All right?

91
00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:59.360
One more example, do you have any money at all? Do you have any money at all?

92
00:05:59.510 --> 00:06:02.450
So again, you're asking, do you have even a little bit of money?

93
00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:05.360
Are you saying that you don't have one single dollar?

94
00:06:05.390 --> 00:06:08.870
You have no money at all? Right?

95
00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:12.260
Now, remember when I said there are some cases in which you can say "at all"

96
00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:15.980
And nothing more and it would make sense. So here's an example.

97
00:06:16.250 --> 00:06:20.120
Let's imagine that your friend is talking about a situation and they tell you.

98
00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:22.550
"The situation has not improved".

99
00:06:23.670 --> 00:06:25.020
And if you're trying to...

100
00:06:25.020 --> 00:06:29.770
If you're surprised by that, you can say "At all?". Right?

101
00:06:29.770 --> 00:06:32.950
So let me say it again. Hopefully, it'll make sense when I say a little bit faster.

102
00:06:33.010 --> 00:06:35.950
Person number one says, "The situation hasn't improved"

103
00:06:35.950 --> 00:06:39.460
And you respond by saying "At all?". Like, really?

104
00:06:39.490 --> 00:06:44.410
And really what you're asking or that's a shorter form of the complete phrase, which is "not at all".

105
00:06:44.410 --> 00:06:47.200
Because you're saying like, "Really? Has not improved even a little bit?

106
00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:51.550
Not at all? Not even in the slightest? It's exactly the same?".

107
00:06:51.550 --> 00:06:54.670
So that's the case in which you can just say "At all?"

108
00:06:54.670 --> 00:06:59.470
And you're asking, like, "Not even a little bit?". You see what I'm saying?

109
00:06:59.470 --> 00:07:03.400
Again, if that's confusing to you or it's like, hard to remember, don't worry too much about it.

110
00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:05.440
I just want the explanation to be clear.

111
00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:08.500
I didn't want to leave anything out because you will hear stuff like this,

112
00:07:08.740 --> 00:07:13.240
You know, from time to time at least here in the U.S. All right?

113
00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:17.070
Now there are some other more advanced ways to use this phrase "at all",

114
00:07:17.080 --> 00:07:20.230
And that is in conditional sentences. All right?

115
00:07:20.230 --> 00:07:25.400
So let me give you an example. If you loved me at all, you would help me.

116
00:07:26.360 --> 00:07:28.820
If you love me at all, you would help me.

117
00:07:28.820 --> 00:07:31.570
Now, although that's a very manipulative thing to say to somebody,

118
00:07:31.580 --> 00:07:33.230
It makes perfect grammatical sense.

119
00:07:33.230 --> 00:07:38.670
And what you're saying is if you loved me even a little bit, then you would help me. Right?

120
00:07:38.780 --> 00:07:43.820
Another example, if he had studied at all, he would have passed the exam.

121
00:07:44.910 --> 00:07:47.280
If he had studied at all, he would have passed the exam.

122
00:07:47.520 --> 00:07:53.160
So again, he's saying if he would have studied just a little bit to any extent,

123
00:07:53.190 --> 00:07:59.430
He would have passed the exam. But since he did not study for the exam, he didn't pass. All right?

124
00:07:59.430 --> 00:08:04.230
One more example, if you have any problems at all, just call me and I'll take care of it.

125
00:08:05.070 --> 00:08:09.210
If you have any problems at all, just call me and I'll take care of it.

126
00:08:09.690 --> 00:08:12.630
So what I'm saying is if you have even the slightest problem,

127
00:08:12.630 --> 00:08:15.990
If you have any problems whatsoever just call me.

128
00:08:15.990 --> 00:08:20.220
So in the first two examples, you're essentially saying, if this thing were true,

129
00:08:20.310 --> 00:08:25.500
Then this other thing would have happened or would happen in the present or the future. Right?

130
00:08:25.500 --> 00:08:28.440
So you're saying, if you loved me, then you would help me.

131
00:08:28.440 --> 00:08:33.390
If your love for me was true, then you would do this.

132
00:08:33.420 --> 00:08:38.520
The second example, if he had done this then this other thing would have happened.

133
00:08:38.610 --> 00:08:42.210
The third example, you're essentially saying, if this thing happens,

134
00:08:42.420 --> 00:08:44.370
Then this other thing will happen.

135
00:08:44.370 --> 00:08:50.040
So if you have any problems at all, then I will help you. I will take care of it.

136
00:08:50.160 --> 00:08:52.110
All right? Cool.

137
00:08:52.970 --> 00:08:56.630
Now, although the third way that we use the phrase "at all" is a little more advanced

138
00:08:56.630 --> 00:09:00.800
And a little less common in everyday situations, you will hear it from time to time.

139
00:09:00.800 --> 00:09:03.800
So hopefully after hearing the explanation of the phrase

140
00:09:03.800 --> 00:09:06.980
And the examples of the other two ways to use this phrase,

141
00:09:06.980 --> 00:09:08.870
You can understand the idea. You know?

142
00:09:08.870 --> 00:09:13.520
The true meaning of the phrase "at all". Which is essentially, you know,

143
00:09:13.730 --> 00:09:20.960
Even a little bit or to some extent or in any way or even slightly or whatsoever. Okay?

144
00:09:21.290 --> 00:09:24.320
Hopefully, hopefully that makes sense.

145
00:09:24.320 --> 00:09:28.420
Hopefully, you understand more now than you did before you started listening to the podcast.

146
00:09:28.430 --> 00:09:30.890
But like I always say, man, feel free to send me your questions.

147
00:09:30.890 --> 00:09:36.140
If you're watching this on YouTube leave a comment below if the explanation wasn't clear.

148
00:09:36.140 --> 00:09:39.110
All right? But that's Coffee with Kaizen number 17 in the books.

149
00:09:39.110 --> 00:09:42.110
So I'll talk to you tomorrow. Peace!

00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:01.330
All right, my friends.

2
00:00:01.330 --> 00:00:02.150
What's up, everybody?

6

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:41.140
All right.

14
00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:47.220
The first thing I wish I would have learned earlier in life is

15
00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:49.530
That your mental health is more important than anything.

16
00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:53.860
I've told you before that achieving any goal in life starts with your mindset.

17
00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:58.600
If you ain't right mentally, you can create all kinds of unnecessary problems for yourself.

18
00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:03.570
You can lose money, lose focus, damage potentially great relationships,

19
00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:09.070
Waste years of your life going in the wrong direction, let other people decide how your life plays out.

20
00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:12.050
The list of things that can go wrong in life is endless.

21
00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:17.750
And it's our job to develop a healthy mind so we can reduce the amount of problems we inevitably face in life.

22
00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:22.120
In other words, there will always be problems and suffering in life.

23
00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.580
But by keeping our minds healthy and productive,

24
00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:28.160
We can make sure that we don't have to suffer any more than what is absolutely necessary.

25
00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:30.890
And this applies to all aspects of your life.

26
00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:35.590
Like, who cares if you got a wonderful career when your home life is toxic?

27
00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:39.960
Who cares if you make a lot of money when you never have time to do things you enjoy?

28
00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:44.490
Who cares if you miss that party when you would have been miserable the whole time there?

29
00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:49.010
Who cares if you love him when all he tries to do is manipulate and control you?

30
00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:53.770
Who cares if you've got a beautiful girl when all she does is bring drama and frustration into your life?

31
00:01:54.690 --> 00:02:00.350
Who cares what your parents want you to do with your life when they're not the ones that have to live your life?

32
00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:06.730
Missing out on things is a part of life. Getting led down is a part of life.

33
00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:09.000
These things are always going to happen.

34
00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:14.350
But at some point, you got to realize that you can't keep letting yourself down just to please other people.

35
00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:19.190
So if taking care of yourself means letting someone down, then let someone down.

36
00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:23.590
If taking care of yourself means choosing a different career, then do that.

37
00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:26.340
If it means ending a relationship, do it.

38
00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:29.280
If it means letting go of a vice, then let it go.

39
00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:36.110
And don't get me wrong, sometimes sacrificing your wants and needs for someone else is a noble or even necessary thing to do.

40
00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:41.900
But the point is that it's going to be really hard to take care of other people if you never take care of yourself.

41
00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:45.810
It's going to be hard to do well at something that you don't really enjoy.

42
00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:50.550
It's going to be hard to cultivate a healthy relationship between unhealthy people.

43
00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:54.260
So if your mind ain't right, nothing else will be either.

44
00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:59.700
The second thing I wish I would have learned much earlier in life is

45
00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:04.010
That you should not or you must not attach yourself to a specific person,

46
00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:07.890
Place, company, organization, project... Nothing like that.

47
00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:10.770
I'm sure we've all been here at some point, though.

48
00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:15.220
Whether it's a person, a place, or a thing it's really easy to end up getting attached to something

49
00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:18.920
And allowing it to consume your entire life or even become a part of your identity.

50
00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:24.420
Some people invest so much of themselves into a job or a career that it's all they know how to do.

51
00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:30.860
They neglect other aspects of their personality and their personal life because they're just so attached to their work.

52
00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:36.760
Other people invest so much of themselves into another person that they end up losing themselves.

53
00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:41.620
They get to a point where their entire life revolves around another human being.

54
00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:45.830
But the problem with getting so attached to a particular job is that

55
00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:49.360
You could wake up tomorrow and find out that your company is downsizing and you're going to be laid off.

56
00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:53.440
If you spent years making your career the main part of your identity,

57
00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:55.750
What happens when your career is taken away from you?

58
00:03:57.490 --> 00:03:59.430
It's almost as if you've lost a part of yourself, isn't it?

59
00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:06.140
And the problem with getting so attached to another person is they could wake up tomorrow and decide they don't love you anymore.

60
00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:12.010
They could lie to you, cheat on you, fuck your best friend, ask for a divorce, all types of shit.

61
00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:17.310
And if you decide to make this person the number one priority in your life above everything else,

62
00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:19.610
What happens when they leave?

63
00:04:21.740 --> 00:04:23.890
It's almost as if they take a piece of you with them, isn't it?

64
00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:27.630
Now, I'm obviously not saying you shouldn't work hard or fall in love.

65
00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:32.460
I'm saying that it's dangerous to develop an unhealthy attachment to temporary things.

66
00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:39.250
People, places, and things come and go. But your purpose in life, your values,

67
00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:45.100
The future you envision for yourself are things that will always be under your control. They'll never leave you.

68
00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:50.270
In fact, those are the things that will guide you forward in life when tragedy inevitably strikes.

69
00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:56.120
So if you're going to get attached to something, make sure it's something that can't be taken from you.

70
00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:08.000
The third thing I wish I would have learned easier in life is that love is a form of intimacy and you can't have intimacy without vulnerability.

71
00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:13.110
Vulnerability is a tricky one because a lot of us have felt the disappointment

72
00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:16.690
And the pain of opening up to another person only to be judged,

73
00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:20.380
Made fun of, not taken seriously, or ignored altogether.

74
00:05:21.670 --> 00:05:25.920
That pain and disappointment are enough to make us believe that we shouldn't open up to anyone ever.

75
00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:32.680
So it's easy to go through life being emotionally unavailable and avoiding intimacy because we think of it as self-defense.

76
00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:36.220
We're trying to protect ourselves from pain and embarrassment.

77
00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:40.090
But the reality is that we're really just hurting ourselves in the long run

78
00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:44.010
Because simply avoiding intimacy doesn't mean that you stop wanting intimacy.

79
00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:52.770
You could very easily spend your entire life alone suffering in silence because you keep making the conscious choice to avoid what you want.

80
00:05:54.530 --> 00:05:59.690
Now, if you think of life without connection and intimacy is right for you, then by all means ignore everything I'm saying here.

81
00:05:59.690 --> 00:06:04.100
But if you do in fact want to share your life with other people and make genuine connections,

82
00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:08.280
Then you must accept the fact that there's no intimacy without vulnerability.

83
00:06:09.810 --> 00:06:13.840
You can't just go through life playing defense, trying to protect yourself from perceived threats all the time.

84
00:06:15.060 --> 00:06:16.320
There's no way you're going to grow like that.

85
00:06:17.590 --> 00:06:21.180
You've got to accept the fact that opening up and being vulnerable is under your control,

86
00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:24.330
But people's response to your vulnerability is not.

87
00:06:24.380 --> 00:06:29.930
So stop focusing on how people are going to react to you and instead just focus on being you.

88
00:06:29.930 --> 00:06:37.500
If people judge you, make fun of you, don't appreciate you, you probably don't want them in your life anyway. Right?

89
00:06:38.370 --> 00:06:44.200
But by being the real you, the right people will naturally be attracted to you. Who cares about everybody else?

90
00:06:46.190 --> 00:06:49.470
I'm not saying that you should open up to everyone you meet.

91
00:06:49.470 --> 00:06:51.650
Like, you obviously have to use some kind of discretion here.

92
00:06:52.410 --> 00:06:56.180
But I'm talking about those of us who consciously choose to avoid interactions,

93
00:06:56.610 --> 00:07:00.640
Conversations, and feelings because we perceive them as scary or dangerous.

94
00:07:02.070 --> 00:07:04.960
Running from something only makes it bigger and scarier.

95
00:07:05.730 --> 00:07:08.690
But at some point, you're going to have to turn around and face it.

96
00:07:11.970 --> 00:07:20.080
The fourth thing I wish I would have learned earlier in life is that 99% of your problems are caused in your head by you and your thoughts.

97
00:07:21.830 --> 00:07:28.620
Most of the time, the problem itself is not the problem, the way you think about the problem is the problem.

98
00:07:29.510 --> 00:07:34.450
And you can fix most of your problems just by changing the way you think, just by fixing your thought process.

99
00:07:35.490 --> 00:07:40.120
For example, have you ever noticed how two completely different people can experience the same situation

100
00:07:40.120 --> 00:07:44.340
At the same time and have two completely different reactions? You know?

101
00:07:44.970 --> 00:07:51.170
For example, like, let's imagine a man and a woman driving to work, two separate people,

102
00:07:51.170 --> 00:07:54.540
Two separate cars going to two separate places, but they're both driving to work in the morning.

103
00:07:55.590 --> 00:08:00.570
So let's imagine, you know, the woman, she's an executive of a huge company. She's got a lot of responsibilities.

104
00:08:00.570 --> 00:08:04.640
She's got to worry about profit and loss and her employees and the managers

105
00:08:04.640 --> 00:08:07.770
And the customers and how we're going to make more money and all these things.

106
00:08:08.180 --> 00:08:12.120
Plus, in her personal life, she's got a husband and kids, her mother's sick in the hospital.

107
00:08:12.580 --> 00:08:13.810
She's got a bunch of stuff going on.

108
00:08:14.470 --> 00:08:16.920
All these things that need to be dealt with on a day-to-day basis.

109
00:08:16.920 --> 00:08:20.950
But right now, she's just going to work, just trying to get to work in the morning.

110
00:08:21.580 --> 00:08:23.080
On the way to work, she gets a flat tire.

111
00:08:23.080 --> 00:08:27.980
There was a nail in the road or something, it punctured the tire, and now she has to change the tire.

112
00:08:29.610 --> 00:08:36.340
And she chooses or impulsively reacts in a way that makes it seem like this is just the end of the world.

113
00:08:36.920 --> 00:08:37.190
She's like,

114
00:08:37.190 --> 00:08:39.610
"Oh my fucking God, my tires are flat. I don't know what I'm going to do"

115
00:08:39.610 --> 00:08:42.450
"Now I got to find somebody to change the tire. I don't know how to change the tire"

116
00:08:42.450 --> 00:08:44.050
"What the fuck! I got so many problems"

117
00:08:44.050 --> 00:08:48.740
"I got my employees and the business and the profits and the losses and the investors breathing down my neck"

118
00:08:48.740 --> 00:08:53.500
"And my mom is sick. I got to go see her after work. How am I going to do that with the flat tire? Fuck!"

119
00:08:54.800 --> 00:08:58.360
She just freaks out, just loses her shit all because she got a flat tire,

120
00:08:58.360 --> 00:09:02.050
Now the entire world has to stop because of this catastrophe.

121
00:09:02.050 --> 00:09:07.900
She has to change her tire. When in reality, if she just changes the tire,

122
00:09:08.820 --> 00:09:14.340
She can keep going to work. Maybe she'll be 45 minutes late. Crisis averted. You see what I'm saying?

123
00:09:15.130 --> 00:09:20.780
But just by thinking about it in a way that's like, so dramatic, so catastrophic,

124
00:09:20.780 --> 00:09:23.180
You make the problem so much bigger and more serious than it is.

125
00:09:23.850 --> 00:09:26.230
And you can see in my explanation of the story I tried to tell,

126
00:09:26.740 --> 00:09:29.170
She started involving all these other things that she has to think about.

127
00:09:29.170 --> 00:09:32.380
And it's like, "Fuck! All that is going to get worse because now I got this flat tire".

128
00:09:33.730 --> 00:09:37.560
She brings all of her stress and problems that she had on her back into the present moment

129
00:09:37.560 --> 00:09:40.130
Just because there's this new situation that needs to be dealt with.

130
00:09:41.220 --> 00:09:49.300
At the end of the day, the tire just needs to be changed. But in her mind, that one unexpected inconvenience is,

131
00:09:49.550 --> 00:09:52.530
Like, a representation of all the problems going on in her life right now.

132
00:09:52.530 --> 00:09:55.180
And it's just like, "Fuck! I can never get a break. This is bullshit"

133
00:09:55.340 --> 00:09:58.710
"Why can't I just get to work? This is some bullshit. It's always another problem"

134
00:09:58.970 --> 00:10:02.330
Blah blah blah blah. See what I'm saying? That's one way of reacting.

135
00:10:02.600 --> 00:10:03.630
But now let's think about the man.

136
00:10:04.710 --> 00:10:11.020
He's also a CEO of a Fortune 500 company. He's got a wife and kids. His father is sick, his dog is sick.

137
00:10:11.020 --> 00:10:14.370
He's just got a bunch of shit going on, got a lot of debt. Whatever it is.

138
00:10:14.720 --> 00:10:17.140
Got a lot of problems, a lot of situations that need to be dealt with.

139
00:10:17.640 --> 00:10:20.320
He's also going to work, and he also gets a flat tire.

140
00:10:20.320 --> 00:10:26.370
But instead of losing his shit about it, he understands this is just a situation that needs to be dealt with.

141
00:10:27.200 --> 00:10:30.570
There's no need to start thinking about all the other issues that I have to deal with.

142
00:10:30.570 --> 00:10:31.730
There's no need to panic like,

143
00:10:31.730 --> 00:10:34.410
"Fuck! I'm going to be late for work. I got this big meeting and presentation"

144
00:10:34.870 --> 00:10:37.810
Because he knows there's nothing he can do about that. Right?

145
00:10:37.810 --> 00:10:40.100
Here, right now he's got a flat tire that needs to be dealt with.

146
00:10:40.160 --> 00:10:43.250
So what does he do? He gets out of his car. He changes the tire.

147
00:10:43.700 --> 00:10:45.260
Or he calls roadside assistance and says,

148
00:10:45.260 --> 00:10:47.600
"Yeah, I got a flat. This is where I am. Please, come help me",

149
00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:49.420
He waits for them to come and change the tire.

150
00:10:49.420 --> 00:10:52.350
And then he goes to work. End of story.

151
00:10:53.260 --> 00:10:57.600
So maybe this isn't the best example, I'm just, you know, making this up as I go along.

152
00:10:58.220 --> 00:11:02.630
But hopefully you can understand, two completely different people, the same situation,

153
00:11:03.040 --> 00:11:05.050
Just two ways of thinking about the same situation.

154
00:11:05.050 --> 00:11:07.030
And they have two completely different experiences.

155
00:11:07.610 --> 00:11:11.200
Same problem, different outcome. Same problem, same reaction.

156
00:11:11.700 --> 00:11:14.250
Or excuse me, different reaction. You see what I'm saying?

157
00:11:14.790 --> 00:11:19.120
So again, that's probably not the best example. But the point is a lot of times,

158
00:11:19.120 --> 00:11:25.360
A lot of situations that you see as this problem are really just situations that need to be dealt with. You know?

159
00:11:25.360 --> 00:11:28.610
And a lot of times when you have an unexpected problem,

160
00:11:29.370 --> 00:11:32.440
There's no need to start thinking about all the other problems that you have

161
00:11:32.730 --> 00:11:35.240
Or how this problem is going to affect all the other things in your life.

162
00:11:35.560 --> 00:11:39.550
Just deal with the fucking problem and keep moving forward. You know?

163
00:11:40.300 --> 00:11:45.720
So many of us slow ourselves down just because of the way we think about shit. You know?

164
00:11:46.460 --> 00:11:51.370
So get out of your fucking head and see things for what they are.

165
00:11:52.160 --> 00:11:54.570
A lot of times problems are just situations that need to be dealt with.

166
00:11:54.570 --> 00:11:59.700
And if you get out of your head, stop talking to yourself and stop bitching about shit and stop freaking out

167
00:12:00.070 --> 00:12:06.150
And allowing your anxiety to take over and just do something, you'll see like, ah it wasn't that big of a deal.

168
00:12:07.550 --> 00:12:10.680
And you can apply that to so many of your problems that you have in life.

169
00:12:10.680 --> 00:12:13.930
If you just change the way you think about it, you might see it's not that big deal

170
00:12:14.280 --> 00:12:18.350
Or actually can do something about that and it won't be a problem anymore. You know?

171
00:12:19.350 --> 00:12:20.940
So I'll leave it at that, man.

172
00:12:22.420 --> 00:12:29.390
The fifth thing I wish I would have learned earlier in life is that if you want to feed a problem, keep thinking about it.

173
00:12:29.390 --> 00:12:33.100
And this actually is just a continuation of what I just said, right?

174
00:12:33.220 --> 00:12:34.390
Get out of your head and take action.

175
00:12:35.250 --> 00:12:39.390
Because, you know, they say if you want to start a problem, take action.

176
00:12:40.480 --> 00:12:44.030
Because problems feed off of anxiety and fear. Right?

177
00:12:44.470 --> 00:12:46.680
And action kills anxiety and fear.

178
00:12:46.680 --> 00:12:52.960
And I really think understanding this concept is the key to learning how to use your anxiety to your advantage.

179
00:12:54.580 --> 00:13:02.770
Most of us with anxious personalities have or end up developing an automatic flight response to situations that make us feel anxious.

180
00:13:03.650 --> 00:13:07.410
When I say flight response, I'm talking about the concept of "fight or flight".

181
00:13:07.410 --> 00:13:09.870
So just in case you don't know what that is, the fighter...

182
00:13:10.310 --> 00:13:14.940
Excuse me, the fight or flight response, also known as the acute stress response,

183
00:13:15.400 --> 00:13:21.250
Refers to a physiological reaction that occurs in the presence of something that is terrifying either mentally or physically.

184
00:13:22.250 --> 00:13:25.940
The response is triggered by the release of hormones that prepare your body to either stay

185
00:13:26.480 --> 00:13:32.850
And deal with the threat or fight or run away to safety. Flee, you see what I'm saying?

186
00:13:32.850 --> 00:13:37.290
And according to the story, this idea, this term "fight or flight"

187
00:13:37.370 --> 00:13:42.960
Is referring to back when our ancestors were literally in dangerous situations every day,

188
00:13:42.960 --> 00:13:46.980
Whether it be fighting a lion or a tiger or an enemy tribe or whatever it is.

189
00:13:46.980 --> 00:13:49.900
Whenever they were faced with danger, they would have to make that decision.

190
00:13:50.250 --> 00:13:51.700
Do I stand and fight, or do I run away?

191
00:13:52.560 --> 00:13:57.610
And the way I understand it, those experiences that our ancestors went through over so many years are

192
00:13:57.610 --> 00:14:01.290
Kind of like baked into us and we just know them as instinct.

193
00:14:02.050 --> 00:14:07.410
So in a moment where you feel anxious or you perceive a threat, you experience that same response,

194
00:14:07.410 --> 00:14:09.410
Which is, do I stand and confront this thing?

195
00:14:09.410 --> 00:14:12.890
Do I deal with it or do I run away because it's too scary? It's the same thing.

196
00:14:13.210 --> 00:14:20.320
Obviously, we're not fighting lions and tigers and bears or enemy tribes in the same way that our ancestors used to. You know?

197
00:14:20.980 --> 00:14:24.560
Things are relatively safer and simpler today in terms of surviving and stuff like that.

198
00:14:24.560 --> 00:14:28.570
We deal with different kinds of threats today or most of us do.

199
00:14:29.220 --> 00:14:32.400
So anyway, getting back to the actual point.

200
00:14:32.670 --> 00:14:35.030
Now you should understand what fight or flight means, right?

201
00:14:35.360 --> 00:14:40.000
We developed this flight response to things that make us anxious.

202
00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:44.900
We developed this automatic reaction to run away from the things that we think are scary or threatening

203
00:14:44.900 --> 00:14:47.680
Or things that makes us or things that make us anxious. You know?

204
00:14:48.540 --> 00:14:51.510
Whenever we feel anxiety, we subconsciously think,

205
00:14:52.610 --> 00:14:57.120
"That's scary, that's dangerous. I should stay away from it. I must avoid that thing"

206
00:14:57.190 --> 00:15:01.900
You know what I'm saying? And that's subconscious thought manifests itself in our behavior.

207
00:15:03.080 --> 00:15:05.900
We start to overthink and question everything.

208
00:15:07.260 --> 00:15:09.800
Like, what if this happens? What if that happens?

209
00:15:10.550 --> 00:15:14.250
We get so deep in our heads and we create this endless loop of anxiety.

210
00:15:15.330 --> 00:15:16.750
Because, you know you need to make a decision,

211
00:15:17.570 --> 00:15:20.320
But you're afraid of making the wrong decision so you feel anxious about it.

212
00:15:21.170 --> 00:15:23.870
That anxiety makes you feel like you don't know enough to move forward,

213
00:15:23.870 --> 00:15:25.690
So instead, you just think about it.

214
00:15:26.830 --> 00:15:30.780
You start analyzing these imaginary scenarios, which also gives you anxiety

215
00:15:30.780 --> 00:15:33.690
Because you know that there's an endless amount of scenarios to imagine.

216
00:15:33.980 --> 00:15:37.490
And you'll never really know what's going to happen until you stop thinking and take action.

217
00:15:39.150 --> 00:15:40.850
But you're not going to take action until you feel ready.

218
00:15:42.080 --> 00:15:46.130
And you're never going to feel ready because you believe that you don't have everything you need to get started.

219
00:15:46.420 --> 00:15:49.090
And then you feel anxious because you know that something needs to be done,

220
00:15:49.090 --> 00:15:51.900
But you're just sitting there thinking about it or avoiding it altogether.

221
00:15:52.460 --> 00:15:54.680
And the cycle repeats itself, endlessly.

222
00:15:54.680 --> 00:16:00.180
You've given so much time and emotional energy to a problem or situation,

223
00:16:00.180 --> 00:16:02.570
But you're not actually doing anything.

224
00:16:04.110 --> 00:16:09.500
With each day that passes, the problem just gets bigger and bigger until it gets to a point that it's too big to deal with on your own.

225
00:16:10.890 --> 00:16:13.140
What you don't realize is that your anxiety is your friend.

226
00:16:14.320 --> 00:16:17.710
Your anxiety is there to tell you what it perceives as a threat to your existence.

227
00:16:18.010 --> 00:16:24.330
Now the reality is most of us nowadays don't experience many things that are actually a threat to our existence.

228
00:16:24.360 --> 00:16:29.580
So nowadays I think your anxiety is there to tell you which areas of your life you need to be more secure in.

229
00:16:30.910 --> 00:16:35.520
So instead of looking at your anxiety as something you need to conquer, you can use it like a tool.

230
00:16:36.910 --> 00:16:38.950
Because it's not the anxiety that needs to be conquered here,

231
00:16:39.310 --> 00:16:41.550
You need to conquer the thing that's making you feel anxious.

232
00:16:42.830 --> 00:16:46.690
So whenever you're feeling anxious about a decision or feeling anxious about another person,

233
00:16:47.210 --> 00:16:51.450
Understand that you got two choices. Fight or flee?

234
00:16:52.870 --> 00:16:55.640
Now, obviously, I don't mean physically fighting your problems or other people.

235
00:16:56.200 --> 00:16:59.470
I mean, confronting the thing that makes you anxious. Right? Taking action.

236
00:17:01.470 --> 00:17:05.070
So maybe you want to start a business or something like that, but you're afraid,

237
00:17:06.080 --> 00:17:10.900
You feel anxious because you think you don't have enough money and you're not sure if people are going to like what you have to offer,

238
00:17:11.220 --> 00:17:14.180
You're not sure if it's going to be a success. You don't really know what to expect.

239
00:17:14.600 --> 00:17:19.070
And naturally, that makes you feel anxious. Right? It's totally normal.

240
00:17:20.390 --> 00:17:25.680
But what you don't understand is like you won't know if people like what you have to offer,

241
00:17:25.940 --> 00:17:29.580
You won't know if you have enough money to get started until you actually get started.

242
00:17:31.260 --> 00:17:32.990
There's no other way to know what's going to happen.

243
00:17:32.990 --> 00:17:39.320
There's no other way to know, you know, what the outcome will be until you stop thinking and you do something.

244
00:17:40.880 --> 00:17:43.280
Period. Period.

245
00:17:43.280 --> 00:17:44.720
I mean, like, I really don't know how else to say it.

246
00:17:44.720 --> 00:17:45.980
You're not going to know until you try.

247
00:17:46.050 --> 00:17:50.040
It's the same thing with people like, maybe that cute girl you want to talk to at the coffee shop.

248
00:17:50.540 --> 00:17:54.510
You see her every single week. But you just so afraid... or that cute guy, it doesn't really matter.

249
00:17:54.510 --> 00:17:59.420
Just cute person that you see every week. You just want to talk to him, but you're so afraid.

250
00:17:59.420 --> 00:18:01.550
It's like, what if she doesn't like me? What if he thinks I'm ugly?

251
00:18:01.550 --> 00:18:06.050
What if she thinks I'm boring? What if I say something stupid to him and he thinks I'm weird?

252
00:18:06.050 --> 00:18:08.570
Like, whatever, just all these irrational fears and thoughts

253
00:18:08.850 --> 00:18:13.970
Because you don't know what's going to happen after you speak to this person. See what I'm saying?

254
00:18:14.790 --> 00:18:19.760
But you won't know until you try. You see what I'm saying?

255
00:18:19.760 --> 00:18:24.790
Like, you're you feel anxiety because you don't know what to expect, you don't know what's going to happen. Right?

256
00:18:24.790 --> 00:18:27.000
That's really what anxiety is, just the fear of the unknown.

257
00:18:29.760 --> 00:18:34.690
And this thing, this challenge, this project, this person, whatever it is,

258
00:18:35.770 --> 00:18:37.870
The issue is that you're not seeing it for what it is.

259
00:18:38.850 --> 00:18:43.350
When you haven't interacted with it yet, when it's completely unknown, it's just darkness and chaos.

260
00:18:43.350 --> 00:18:47.490
It's something that induces fear. You don't see it for what it is.

261
00:18:47.490 --> 00:18:52.410
You see it for this dark, scary, unknown figure. That's a threat to your existence.

262
00:18:52.470 --> 00:18:54.910
When really it's just a threat to your ego. You know what I'm saying?

263
00:18:56.940 --> 00:19:01.000
And by doing that, by seeing it in that way, by keeping it at a distance and not interacting with it,

264
00:19:02.130 --> 00:19:05.630
It's like you put it up on this pedestal. You see what I'm saying?

265
00:19:05.630 --> 00:19:07.720
It's not a person anymore, it's not a thing anymore,

266
00:19:07.720 --> 00:19:13.210
It's this figure, this unattainable figure that you don't understand. You know?

267
00:19:13.290 --> 00:19:17.200
And the longer you keep it on that pedestal, it's like it gets higher and higher

268
00:19:17.200 --> 00:19:19.710
And higher until the point where you're just looking up at this thing.

269
00:19:19.710 --> 00:19:26.260
And now that it's above you and it's big and scary, you feel inferior to it. You see what I'm saying?

270
00:19:26.260 --> 00:19:29.450
And that only causes more anxiety and makes you feel even more like,

271
00:19:29.870 --> 00:19:31.030
I could never talk to that person.

272
00:19:31.030 --> 00:19:32.270
I could never start that business.

273
00:19:32.270 --> 00:19:33.740
I could never be successful at that thing.

274
00:19:34.100 --> 00:19:39.840
Because you just let it get so big and grandiose and scary in your mind that you can't see it for what it is.

275
00:19:39.840 --> 00:19:45.040
It's just another person, it's just the business, it's just the project, it's just this thing.

276
00:19:46.180 --> 00:19:50.330
And by going over there to interact with it, let's use the person as the example, I feel like that's universal.

277
00:19:51.520 --> 00:19:53.840
By going over there to interact with that girl or that guy,

278
00:19:54.760 --> 00:19:57.600
Then you can see what happens if I go interact with this person.

279
00:19:58.510 --> 00:20:00.950
You'll very quickly see it's just another person.

280
00:20:02.570 --> 00:20:06.420
Just another human being, you might see that this person is the most amazing person you ever met

281
00:20:06.680 --> 00:20:10.250
And that they're glad that you came over to say something because they were thinking the same thing about you.

282
00:20:11.050 --> 00:20:12.930
Now you guys are married, you got kids beautiful family,

283
00:20:13.480 --> 00:20:18.130
All because you decided to go talk to him instead of just thinking about it. You took action.

284
00:20:18.870 --> 00:20:23.800
Or you might realize they're a fucking asshole. He's a dick. She's a bitch.

285
00:20:23.930 --> 00:20:27.890
I don't want somebody like that in my life. But you won't know that until you go talk to them.

286
00:20:29.410 --> 00:20:31.990
Just go talk to them. You see what I'm saying? Just go say hello.

287
00:20:32.980 --> 00:20:37.070
Stop thinking about it. Get out of your fucking head and just take action. Go say hello.

288
00:20:37.380 --> 00:20:38.860
You don't even have to start a conversation.

289
00:20:39.580 --> 00:20:46.100
Just go pay the person a thoughtful compliment or just say "hello" and walk away. That's it. You know?

290
00:20:46.100 --> 00:20:48.850
A perfect example of this... again, I didn't write all this down,

291
00:20:48.850 --> 00:20:52.500
I'm just kind of thinking and talking at the same time. So sorry for rambling.

292
00:20:52.950 --> 00:21:00.350
But another good example of this that I experienced personally was when I was doing street portraiture a couple of years ago in Brazil.

293
00:21:00.660 --> 00:21:04.230
I think I talked about this on the podcast before, but when I was down...

294
00:21:04.300 --> 00:21:08.090
I love photography, specifically portrait photography, like taking pictures of people.

295
00:21:08.650 --> 00:21:12.120
So when I was down in Brazil, there was this main street called Paulista Avenue,

296
00:21:12.340 --> 00:21:15.670
Like this super long main street that ran right through the middle of the city.

297
00:21:16.800 --> 00:21:20.380
All the businesses and shops and restaurants were on the street, so thousands,

298
00:21:20.380 --> 00:21:23.280
Probably hundreds of thousands of people walk down the street every day.

299
00:21:24.610 --> 00:21:28.500
So since I didn't know very many people, I didn't have any models to take pictures of,

300
00:21:28.500 --> 00:21:29.970
And I really don't like photographing models.

301
00:21:31.650 --> 00:21:36.460
I decided I'm going to go into the street and ask strangers if I can make portraits of them, for two reasons.

302
00:21:36.820 --> 00:21:41.910
One, I just want to take pictures of people, and there's thousands of people here, so I'm going to start here.

303
00:21:42.310 --> 00:21:47.360
Number two, I was very anxious in social situations, I was afraid of interacting with strangers.

304
00:21:47.360 --> 00:21:49.270
It was something that made me uncomfortable,

305
00:21:49.270 --> 00:21:52.650
And I felt like I didn't know how to do it correctly, whatever the fuck that means.

306
00:21:52.860 --> 00:21:54.840
So it was kind of like exposure therapy for me.

307
00:21:55.490 --> 00:22:02.540
Because I was afraid to approach these people and be rejected or seem weird or not know what to say and not have a positive interaction.

308
00:22:02.880 --> 00:22:04.850
Whatever. I was just afraid of a negative outcome.

309
00:22:05.610 --> 00:22:09.670
And I would get so deep in my head like I would be on the street with my camera,

310
00:22:09.670 --> 00:22:12.410
Just looking at people like afraid to pick one and go talk to them.

311
00:22:12.410 --> 00:22:15.120
It was like, what if they say no? What if it doesn't go right? What if...

312
00:22:15.400 --> 00:22:20.140
And I'm in Brazil. I got to speak in a foreign language and make myself understood and be charismatic and like,

313
00:22:20.190 --> 00:22:23.040
Concise and get to the point because I'm stopping this person on the street.

314
00:22:23.330 --> 00:22:24.570
They're just trying to get to where they're going.

315
00:22:24.930 --> 00:22:28.950
All these things are running through my head and it kept me from taking action until I just got tired of it.

316
00:22:28.950 --> 00:22:33.340
And I was like, "Fuck it, I'm going to just stop somebody and see what happens. See what happens".

317
00:22:33.980 --> 00:22:39.480
And what I realize is, like again, anxiety is just fear of the unknown, bro. That's all it is.

318
00:22:39.480 --> 00:22:42.710
So when you go approach this person and you talk to them, it's not the unknown anymore.

319
00:22:43.310 --> 00:22:46.790
You don't have time to be in your head thinking about what if or what would happen.

320
00:22:46.890 --> 00:22:49.780
It's happening right here, right now. It's happening.

321
00:22:50.480 --> 00:22:55.630
Because you took the time to take action to approach this person. We're here now.

322
00:22:56.660 --> 00:23:00.470
The anxiety just disappears because it's not unknown anymore.

323
00:23:00.470 --> 00:23:03.930
Now you know what happens if I approach this person because you approached them and it's fucking..

324
00:23:03.930 --> 00:23:06.130
We're here. We're talking. You see what I'm saying?

325
00:23:06.770 --> 00:23:12.100
What I realize with that experience as well is that most people are not like judging you

326
00:23:12.100 --> 00:23:15.370
Or they don't want to see you fail when you approach them as a stranger on the street.

327
00:23:15.760 --> 00:23:17.780
They just want to know why the fuck did you stop me, bro?

328
00:23:17.840 --> 00:23:23.120
So if you can learn how to communicate that clearly and concisely, most people don't really mind.

329
00:23:23.120 --> 00:23:26.170
I got a few no's, but most people said, "Yeah, sure. Go ahead, take my picture".

330
00:23:26.170 --> 00:23:28.660
And then they become curious about what you're doing and why you're doing it.

331
00:23:29.170 --> 00:23:31.570
And now you guys are talking and having an interaction, you know?

332
00:23:31.570 --> 00:23:33.940
Maybe you make friends, maybe you meet up for drinks later or whatever.

333
00:23:33.940 --> 00:23:36.120
You just never know what's going to happen.

334
00:23:36.120 --> 00:23:39.460
And maybe the interaction is negative. Maybe they tell you to fuck off.

335
00:23:39.500 --> 00:23:42.060
Maybe they tell you you're a weirdo or piece of shit, whatever.

336
00:23:42.060 --> 00:23:45.380
But like, who cares? Who cares?

337
00:23:46.020 --> 00:23:52.360
Go do it again and again and again and again and again until it's just so natural to approach strangers that you don't even think about it.

338
00:23:53.750 --> 00:23:57.990
That is how you conquer what you think of as anxiety, but it's not the anxiety that's the issue.

339
00:23:58.510 --> 00:24:02.030
The anxiety is there to tell you like, man, this thing is scary, you're not secure in this area.

340
00:24:02.300 --> 00:24:07.700
So you can use the anxiety as your friend, as a tool to put your focus on what needs to be improved.

341
00:24:08.460 --> 00:24:11.470
Your anxiety is telling you, "Hey, we're weak in that area. We need to change that".

342
00:24:12.560 --> 00:24:16.540
So go and change that, take some action, and stop thinking about it. You know?

343
00:24:17.160 --> 00:24:21.210
I probably should have wrote what I thought so that I could deliver this message in a much more concise way.

344
00:24:21.770 --> 00:24:27.220
But hopefully, you get my point, man. Like, just stop thinking about shit and just do it.

345
00:24:27.220 --> 00:24:28.920
That's the only way to know what's going to happen.

346
00:24:29.210 --> 00:24:32.440
That's the only way to gain confidence because when you take action you get feedback.

347
00:24:33.140 --> 00:24:37.580
When you get feedback you know what you need to change, how you can do it better, how you can do it differently.

348
00:24:37.980 --> 00:24:41.690
You can't know any of that if you don't take action, if you're just sitting there thinking about it.

349
00:24:43.530 --> 00:24:45.550
Thinking, thinking, thinking, nothing ever happens, bro.

350
00:24:45.550 --> 00:24:49.630
But time keeps on passing. The world keeps spinning without you.

351
00:24:50.860 --> 00:24:56.900
So, I could... each one of these things, each of these 7 things I can make an entire episode about.

352
00:24:56.900 --> 00:25:00.670
I could talk for days about all these things, so I'm just going to leave it at that. You know?

353
00:25:00.890 --> 00:25:03.480
Hopefully it sparks some interest in your mind, give you something to think about.

354
00:25:03.540 --> 00:25:07.490
Or maybe we'll start a dialogue and a conversation about these subjects in the future.

355
00:25:07.490 --> 00:25:11.100
But for real man, if you want to feed a problem, just keep thinking about it.

356
00:25:11.100 --> 00:25:18.720
If you want to solve it, do something. Take action. All right? Let's leave it at that.

357
00:25:19.650 --> 00:25:23.830
So the sixth thing that I wish I would have learned earlier in life is that

358
00:25:24.270 --> 00:25:27.440
Nobody is as successful as social media makes them seem.

359
00:25:28.480 --> 00:25:32.180
And nobody looks as good as those social media filters make them look.

360
00:25:32.690 --> 00:25:36.540
Now, this is... This topic, this subject, this idea is really nothing new.

361
00:25:36.540 --> 00:25:39.530
We've had social media in our lives for a few years now,

362
00:25:39.530 --> 00:25:43.880
And you know, we've seen the effects that it has on people's confidence or self-esteem.

363
00:25:43.880 --> 00:25:48.640
And we've seen how easy it is for people to make it seem like they're living this amazing,

364
00:25:48.640 --> 00:25:50.990
Wonderful, extravagant, successful life.

365
00:25:50.990 --> 00:25:54.970
When really, their life, their actual life is not much different from yours.

366
00:25:55.370 --> 00:26:00.130
And even if it were, like, it has nothing to do with you, it doesn't really matter.

367
00:26:00.130 --> 00:26:06.940
The only person that you should be comparing yourself to is who you were yesterday or who you were last week or who you were last year.

368
00:26:07.980 --> 00:26:13.270
You can't compare yourself to somebody else because it's an unfair... You can't compare apples and oranges.

369
00:26:14.300 --> 00:26:17.630
You can only compare apples with other apples. You see what I'm saying?

370
00:26:17.630 --> 00:26:22.140
Your life is not somebody else's. Your starting point is not somebody else's. Your history is not someone else's.

371
00:26:22.140 --> 00:26:25.570
So how could you compare your current position in life to somebody else's

372
00:26:25.900 --> 00:26:28.730
When you didn't start at the same exact place or go through the same exact things?

373
00:26:29.490 --> 00:26:32.880
You weren't born with the same exact talents. You know? Parents.

374
00:26:32.880 --> 00:26:37.940
Like all... There's no way you could compare yourself to another person. Realistically, there's no way.

375
00:26:39.880 --> 00:26:46.750
So like, there's no reason, there's no logical reason to get lost in the idea that somebody else is further along than you are

376
00:26:46.850 --> 00:26:50.550
Or more successful than you are, more money than you have or prettier than you are,

377
00:26:50.630 --> 00:26:52.510
Taller than you are, funnier than you are.

378
00:26:52.510 --> 00:26:56.080
Like, who gives a shit? You can't compare yourself to somebody else.

379
00:26:57.360 --> 00:27:01.050
And getting back to the actual statement, like nobody's as successful as they seem online.

380
00:27:02.330 --> 00:27:04.500
Even if they are, it has nothing to do with you.

381
00:27:05.580 --> 00:27:07.980
But in the case that they're not because most of the time they're really not,

382
00:27:08.370 --> 00:27:13.110
You just got to understand like, social media is just like a highlight reel.

383
00:27:13.110 --> 00:27:17.860
Most people are not going to willingly show you the negative parts of their life,

384
00:27:17.860 --> 00:27:23.670
The things they're struggling with, the failures, their insecurities, you know, all the shit that's going wrong.

385
00:27:23.670 --> 00:27:29.990
Because that's not sexy, that doesn't sell. It doesn't give views, likes, shares, comments, subscriptions, and all that shit.

386
00:27:31.270 --> 00:27:34.110
And unfortunately, a lot of people that do try to show you the negative side

387
00:27:34.110 --> 00:27:36.900
Or whatever are just looking for like sympathy, they just want you to feel bad,

388
00:27:37.300 --> 00:27:40.320
Which is also a way to increase viewership and likes and all this type of stuff.

389
00:27:41.080 --> 00:27:43.340
I'm not saying that's always the case, but it does happen.

390
00:27:44.270 --> 00:27:47.870
Either way, the point is when you're looking on your phone... Where's my phone?

391
00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:50.160
It's over there, it's too far to grab.

392
00:27:50.160 --> 00:27:52.690
But when you're looking on your phone, it's nothing more than a window.

393
00:27:53.990 --> 00:27:56.490
The phone is literally just a window into a different world.

394
00:27:57.170 --> 00:28:01.080
A computer screen, it's just a window. A TV is just a window into a different world. That's it.

395
00:28:02.170 --> 00:28:05.170
What you realize is like, even in a house, it has four sides. Right?

396
00:28:05.450 --> 00:28:08.290
So I'm looking out this window and I see this image.

397
00:28:09.340 --> 00:28:15.020
But what I don't really think about too much is that there's a whole bunch of stuff just out of my field of view

398
00:28:15.930 --> 00:28:20.670
That I can't see that makes part of that entire image. So I'm only seeing a little piece of it.

399
00:28:21.820 --> 00:28:24.900
Only what the... What I can see through the window, that's all that exists to me.

400
00:28:24.970 --> 00:28:29.830
But in reality, there's 360 degrees. You know what I'm saying?

401
00:28:29.940 --> 00:28:32.570
And a large part of that, I'm not even getting to see or consider.

402
00:28:33.490 --> 00:28:39.350
So don't get caught up in the way things look or the way things seem. You know what I'm saying?

403
00:28:40.400 --> 00:28:41.680
Because perspective is everything.

404
00:28:41.680 --> 00:28:46.590
If you looked at the same situation or person through a different or from a different perspective,

405
00:28:47.140 --> 00:28:52.970
Through a different window, you might see it completely differently and understand like, there's so much more than what you just see.

406
00:28:54.210 --> 00:28:58.050
So getting caught up in how beautiful this girl is or how good this guy looks,

407
00:28:58.050 --> 00:29:00.690
How much money this person has, or how successful these people are.

408
00:29:00.690 --> 00:29:05.090
Like, you'll never really know what's going on in their lives.

409
00:29:06.180 --> 00:29:09.220
Unless you spend every day with them and really see.

410
00:29:09.590 --> 00:29:14.880
You never really know that's what she really looks like unless you're in the same room with her

411
00:29:14.880 --> 00:29:19.030
And she just got out of the shower and all the makeup is gone, all the filters are gone.

412
00:29:19.030 --> 00:29:22.740
You never really know what she looks like. And even if you could, who gives a shit?

413
00:29:24.200 --> 00:29:26.220
There's some girls prettier than you. Who gives a shit?

414
00:29:26.740 --> 00:29:31.720
Some dude looks better than you. Who cares? Who cares? Has nothing to do with you, bro.

415
00:29:32.280 --> 00:29:37.170
Focus on yourself. And realizing the dreams and visions that you got in your head.

416
00:29:38.330 --> 00:29:41.810
Focus on like, changing the things that you can actually change, the things under your control.

417
00:29:41.810 --> 00:29:46.320
Accept the things that you can't. Accept the things that like, have nothing to do with you. And keep moving, bro.

418
00:29:46.320 --> 00:29:49.250
You don't have time to waste. You really don't.

419
00:29:49.250 --> 00:29:53.440
Stop getting caught up in other people's lives and what they got going on and how good they look, and this, this, and that.

420
00:29:53.440 --> 00:29:58.430
It does nothing for you, bro. If you can't take it and use it as inspiration, it does nothing for you.

421
00:29:59.870 --> 00:30:04.880
Let it go. Focus on yourself. Focus on your life. You know what I'm saying?

422
00:30:06.340 --> 00:30:08.710
Again, this idea is nothing new, I'm sure it's been talked about like,

423
00:30:09.440 --> 00:30:13.160
Thousands of times over the last few years. But I wish I would have learned that sooner.

424
00:30:13.160 --> 00:30:17.490
It's like even the people you look up to, even the people you admire and want to be like,

425
00:30:17.490 --> 00:30:23.030
Even they are not all that they seem to be, or they're so much more than what they seem to be.

426
00:30:23.810 --> 00:30:25.780
And that could be good, bad, neutral, whatever.

427
00:30:25.780 --> 00:30:30.990
But there's so much more than what you see. It's so much more than what you perceive from a distance.

428
00:30:31.810 --> 00:30:37.660
So don't get caught up just in what you see. Understand that there's always so much more than that. You know?

429
00:30:39.410 --> 00:30:43.180
I don't know if that makes sense, but I'm gonna leave it at that. All right?

430
00:30:43.550 --> 00:30:49.760
So the seventh, and final thing that I wish I would have learned earlier

431
00:30:50.720 --> 00:30:57.470
Is that you cannot trust another person's words if those words don't align with their actions.

432
00:30:59.060 --> 00:31:02.950
A person's words will tell you what they think, what they believe.

433
00:31:03.670 --> 00:31:08.130
But a person's actions will show you what they really think or really believe.

434
00:31:09.230 --> 00:31:11.720
This one is really important, man. It's really, really important.

435
00:31:11.720 --> 00:31:13.310
Because people just, people who love to talk.

436
00:31:14.580 --> 00:31:18.600
Talk, talk, talk, talk, talk, talk, talk, talk, talk, talk. They just talk and talk and talk and talk.

437
00:31:19.150 --> 00:31:25.870
It's easy to talk, right? It's easy to lie, is easy to exaggerate, all these things. It's easy to talk.

438
00:31:27.490 --> 00:31:29.590
You know what I'm saying? So easy.

439
00:31:29.620 --> 00:31:32.850
What I'm going to do, what I really think, what I believe and this, this, and that.

440
00:31:34.360 --> 00:31:38.920
What's not so easy, though, is to show it with your actions, or it's easy if what you're saying is true.

441
00:31:40.010 --> 00:31:42.410
But I guess what I'm trying to say is it's easy to talk,

442
00:31:43.180 --> 00:31:49.760
But it's harder to find somebody who is living what they talk, doing what they say they're going to do.

443
00:31:50.880 --> 00:31:53.380
And the reason you can't trust people who are not living in that way is

444
00:31:53.380 --> 00:32:00.000
Because you're just opening yourself up to all kinds of disappointment, manipulation, like problems.

445
00:32:00.810 --> 00:32:04.870
Or putting your trust in somebody who says they're going to do A, B, and C, and then they go do an X Y Z.

446
00:32:06.870 --> 00:32:13.790
You just open yourself up to the problems, frustration, disappointment, all these negative things. You know what I'm saying?

447
00:32:15.170 --> 00:32:20.270
Because I mean like, saying you're going to do one thing and then going to do another thing is the same thing as lying. Right?

448
00:32:20.800 --> 00:32:26.450
Somebody who's always saying these things but doing those things, it's no different than a liar, in my opinion.

449
00:32:27.240 --> 00:32:31.020
If you're saying this is who I am, this is what I'm about. And then you go live something else, you're lying.

450
00:32:31.020 --> 00:32:35.120
You're not telling the truth. You're not living the truth. All right?

451
00:32:35.120 --> 00:32:39.670
So you can't trust people like that, bro. It's very easy to like,

452
00:32:39.670 --> 00:32:44.260
Get enchanted by the way someone speaks, to the word that they choose. You know?

453
00:32:45.850 --> 00:32:48.100
There's a lot of silver-tongued salesmen out there.

454
00:32:48.100 --> 00:32:54.980
And it's very easy to get, you know, lost in their way of speaking. Right?

455
00:32:54.980 --> 00:32:59.240
They're charismatic, they know what to say, they know when to say it, they know how to say it and all these things.

456
00:32:59.240 --> 00:33:03.400
They get you feeling good. They make you laugh and smile when you're around them. You know?

457
00:33:03.400 --> 00:33:05.310
They make you believe whatever it is that they're saying.

458
00:33:05.310 --> 00:33:09.490
But, you know, you really got to remember to stop, take a step back

459
00:33:10.080 --> 00:33:16.600
And ask yourself, are they doing what they're saying? Do their words match their actions? You know what I'm saying?

460
00:33:17.100 --> 00:33:20.810
And that's in any situation. It could be in business, in a relationship or friendship, whatever.

461
00:33:20.810 --> 00:33:24.730
This person is saying all these things, but if they're not proving it with their actions,

462
00:33:24.730 --> 00:33:30.230
They're not living it, it's just words, bro. It doesn't mean anything. You know what I'm saying?

463
00:33:31.700 --> 00:33:35.760
Words are just words, but actions are real. Actions show you. You know what I'm saying?

464
00:33:36.100 --> 00:33:38.440
What a person really thinks and believes, what's really important to them.

465
00:33:38.440 --> 00:33:41.960
You want to know what a person really thinks, believes, what's important to them,

466
00:33:41.960 --> 00:33:43.790
What they really care about, pay attention to what they do.

467
00:33:44.710 --> 00:33:49.430
Because just naturally, without really thinking about it, we focus on what's important to us at the moment.

468
00:33:49.870 --> 00:33:52.540
We invest our time and energy into what's important to us.

469
00:33:53.090 --> 00:33:57.610
Everything else we don't really care about, even if we say we care about it.

470
00:33:57.610 --> 00:34:00.950
Like, I want to be fluent in English, but I'm not practicing my English.

471
00:34:02.830 --> 00:34:04.230
You don't really want to be fluent. Right?

472
00:34:04.230 --> 00:34:08.450
Because you're not doing the things that are going to get you to where you say you want to be.

473
00:34:08.450 --> 00:34:11.020
So obviously you don't really want that because if you did, you would just do it.

474
00:34:11.220 --> 00:34:15.210
The same way you go to get some food when you're hungry. You see what I'm saying?

475
00:34:15.270 --> 00:34:20.020
I'm hungry. I want some food. I want to satisfy my hunger. I get up and I go get food.

476
00:34:20.110 --> 00:34:22.910
I just do it because that's what I really want. You know?

477
00:34:23.380 --> 00:34:25.430
It's easy to say "I want to be fluent in this language",

478
00:34:25.430 --> 00:34:31.850
But then every day I'm not doing anything to become fluent in the language because that's not really what I want. You see?

479
00:34:32.600 --> 00:34:34.840
I can give you a million examples like, again,

480
00:34:34.840 --> 00:34:38.780
I probably should have prepared better for this episode. I'm just like, speaking off the cuff.

481
00:34:39.650 --> 00:34:44.870
But I'm sure you get my point, is that the actions don't match the words do not put your trust in that person.

482
00:34:47.090 --> 00:34:52.480
Trust me on that. As ironic as that sounds. But yeah, for real man, for real.

483
00:34:53.770 --> 00:35:00.060
You can't... I shouldn't say you can't fuck with people whose actions don't align with their words, you can do whatever you want.

484
00:35:00.060 --> 00:35:02.290
That's just something I wish I would have learned earlier,

485
00:35:02.600 --> 00:35:06.030
Especially in the context of like relationships. You know what I mean?

486
00:35:08.810 --> 00:35:12.630
I'll probably do like an in-depth episode about each of these topics in the future

487
00:35:12.630 --> 00:35:16.830
Because I want to say so much but like, this episode is already so long.

488
00:35:17.240 --> 00:35:20.640
And my plan was to just give you 7 quick little things to start to think about.

489
00:35:21.250 --> 00:35:25.910
But since I didn't write everything I wanted to say, like, I'm going off and just like, you know,

490
00:35:26.900 --> 00:35:30.350
In my thoughts, I don't really know exactly what I think. I just have an idea of what I want to say.

491
00:35:31.060 --> 00:35:32.980
So again, my bad. Sorry for rambling.

492
00:35:33.380 --> 00:35:37.690
If you are still with me at this point, I want to close out by just asking you,

493
00:35:38.310 --> 00:35:41.890
What are some things that you wish you would have learned, you know, earlier in life?

494
00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:44.870
I don't care how old you are, you could be 18, 85. I really don't care.

495
00:35:45.470 --> 00:35:49.440
All of us have gone through things, all of us have learned, hopefully, from our experiences.

496
00:35:50.120 --> 00:35:53.840
And I think the lessons that we learn from our experiences can and should be shared with other people.

497
00:35:53.840 --> 00:35:55.730
That's the reason I'm making this episode. So let me know.

498
00:35:55.730 --> 00:36:00.640
What are some things you wish that you would have learned earlier in life that maybe you can help somebody else

499
00:36:01.160 --> 00:36:04.980
To learn from without having to go through? You know what I'm saying? Let me know.

500
00:36:04.980 --> 00:36:08.280

00:00:01.050 --> 00:00:03.480
Dr. Jordan B. Peterson:
"Words are power. No, wrong.

2
00:00:03.790 --> 00:00:13.520
Words are authority. Words are legitimate authority. And so,
without having your words in order, you have no legitimate

3
00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:20.100
authority. And that's the last thing you want, unless all
you want is irresponsibility but that isn't going to work

4
00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:27.500
out for you anyway. And so, the pathway to success for
virtually everyone is facilitation of their capacity to

5
00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:28.130
communicate."

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:41.140
Tony Kaizen:
If you're a young man on the path of self-improvement, then
there are a lot of things you got to do. You've got to get

7
00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:46.360
your mental health in order, right? You've got to deal with
those demons in the depths of your soul if you hope to live

8
00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:51.990
a healthy and productive life. You've got to learn some
technical skills that will get you paid because there's no

9
00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:57.970
love for a broke man in this world. You've got to get your
body in good shape and learn how to use it to defend

10
00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:04.550
yourself and the people you love. You've got to establish a
network of like-minded individuals to learn from and grow

11
00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:10.290
with because those are the people you're going to lean on
when you need some support. But out of all the things you

12
00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:18.360
must do as a young man, none are more important than
developing your communication skills. If you want a healthy

13
00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:25.930
mind, some profitable skills, a powerful body, and a social
circle of quality individuals, then you must learn to

14
00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:32.990
communicate. Not only with other people, but even more
importantly with yourself. So in this episode, we're going

15
00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:38.880
to listen to The Godfather himself, Dr. Jordan B. Peterson,
talking about the importance of good communication skills

16
00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:45.460
and how young men in particular can develop and use them to
become formidable and successful members of society. So

17
00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:46.140
let's check it out.

18
00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:56.600
Dr. Jordan B. Peterson:
"I have an app coming out in a month or two -- hopefully a
month -- called Essay, and I've been working on that with my

19
00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:04.060
son Julian and some other people for four years, and it
stemmed out of our project to sort of universalize the

20
00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:10.230
university, which was too big for me to manage when I got
sick and sort of we narrowed it in scope because we wanted

21
00:02:10.230 --> 00:02:15.720
to teach people how to write. And that's really hard to
scale because you usually learn to write by having people

22
00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:23.260
write, read what you've written, and critique it, and that's
very labor intensive and expensive. So we built a writing

23
00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:32.930
program, like a word processor that has built-in conceptual
tools that aid in the conceptualization of an essay. So

24
00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:38.780
imagine when you're writing, first of all, you have to pick
a good question because you want to answer it. It has to be

25
00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:46.280
a genuine intellectual enterprise. And so the kids are never
taught that. And so pick something important that you want

26
00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:55.820
to explore and then, okay, so what are you doing when you're
writing? Choosing words, forming

27
00:02:55.820 --> 00:03:02.710
phrases, organizing them into sentences, sequencing the
sentences in paragraphs, sequencing the paragraphs into the

28
00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:08.600
chapter, and then chapter into books if you're going that
far. But so it's a hierarchical enterprise. And so when you

29
00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:13.180
write, you have to get the word right in the phrase, right
in the sentence, right in the sentence order. Right? And you

30
00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:18.870
shouldn't do all that at once because you can't because it's
too hard. So you write a rough first draft that's twice as

31
00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:25.260
long as the thing you're trying to write, and then you edit.
You shorten the sentences, you pick the right words, you

32
00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:30.850
pick the right phrases, you rewrite the sentences. So we
built in tools to guide people through this process to help

33
00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:37.050
them conceptualize their essay at the level of the word and
the phrase and the sentence and the paragraph. And to build

34
00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:43.000
those ideas of multi-level editing into the process. And
then we've tested it on a lot of people and we have a nice,

35
00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:48.970
elegant user interface. And we're hoping that,
because...because one of the things I've learned is that

36
00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:52.700
words are power. No, wrong.

37
00:03:53.020 --> 00:04:02.750
Words are authority. Words are legitimate authority. And so
without having your words in order, you have no legitimate

38
00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:09.330
authority. And that's the last thing you want, unless all
you want is irresponsibility but that isn't going to work

39
00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:16.730
out for you anyway. And so the pathway to success for
virtually everyone is facilitation of their capacity to

40
00:04:16.730 --> 00:04:24.640
communicate. And so we're hoping...we really...we really
want to pull young men into using this product because

41
00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:31.860
they're the hardest market to target with such things and
the most in need of it. And part of that is engaging them in

42
00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:39.880
an honest dialogue about what exactly writing is. It's like,
there's no difference between writing and thinking. And

43
00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:49.100
there's no difference between thinking and not failing. So
you let your thoughts die instead of you - that's thinking.

44
00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:55.860
You test everything you do before you implement it - that's
thinking. And writing is a massive aid to that process. And

45
00:04:55.860 --> 00:05:05.170
so if young men in particular were taught properly about
writing and thinking, they would come to view those as like

46
00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:14.740
arrows in their quiver. So...or shields in...in their...in
their combat or the means by which they

47
00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:21.830
aggregate their allies or even more importantly, the...the
means by which they serve themselves in the world properly

48
00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:28.310
and like really, not...No, no moral overlay on top of this. 
Well, you know, you're a communicator, you're like...you're

49
00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:34.270
a comedian, you're a master of words, you're a master of
wit, you're a master of listening. That's why you're

50
00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:40.240
successful in this weird, radical way that's completely
unpredictable. And it's also the pathway to adventure. Get

51
00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:47.340
your words in order. And so that's ESSAY. And like I said, I
think if you go to my website or to essay.app, essay.app, or

52
00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:54.760
to my website, you can sign up for...for the...we're going
to do a beta release tested broadly to make sure it doesn't

53
00:05:55.530 --> 00:06:02.430
fall apart under use pressure and before we release it
completely. But we're very excited about that because how to

54
00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:10.240
teach people to write is a really hard academic problem to
solve, and the idea of building the writing tools into the

55
00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:18.590
software, if we got it right, maybe could...could at least
in part address that problem. It's a massive problem. It's a

56
00:06:18.590 --> 00:06:23.320
massive problem. Right? Most people come through university
now without learning how to write, and that means they don't

57
00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:27.010
know how to think. And that means they don't know how to
talk. It's not good."

58
00:06:30.510 --> 00:06:36.070
Tony Kaizen:
In episode number 92 of the podcast, I explained how writing
in a journal every day is not only the key to being able to

59
00:06:36.070 --> 00:06:43.060
think in English, but the key to communicating more
effectively in English. By taking the time to put your

60
00:06:43.060 --> 00:06:51.110
thoughts on paper, you can record, analyze, edit, and refine
them over time. Our thoughts and beliefs are the driving

61
00:06:51.110 --> 00:06:56.660
forces behind every single decision we make. So the
importance of regularly reviewing them cannot be overstated.

62
00:06:58.370 --> 00:07:06.510
From the day we're born, we're repetitively told what to
think. And what we're told to think is generally what

63
00:07:06.510 --> 00:07:14.540
everyone else thinks. And as I said before, what we think
dictates how we behave. So maybe that's the reason that so

64
00:07:14.540 --> 00:07:20.510
many people just do what everyone else does without actually
considering their decision-making process. They're not

65
00:07:20.510 --> 00:07:27.750
thinking for themselves. Many of us allow our societal
programming and our ever changing emotions to dictate

66
00:07:27.850 --> 00:07:36.430
everything we say and do. But why is that? I think it's
because most of us are never taught how to think.

67
00:07:37.670 --> 00:07:43.660
Most of us are never taught how to identify and combat our
cognitive biases. Most of us are never taught how to react

68
00:07:43.840 --> 00:07:50.670
to our intense emotions. Most of us are never taught how to
think strategically. Most of us are never taught how to

69
00:07:50.670 --> 00:07:58.460
diversify our vocabulary and develop our communication
skills. Once I started learning and teaching languages, I

70
00:07:58.460 --> 00:08:07.100
realized that being able to communicate effectively is the
key to absolutely everything you want in this life: money,

71
00:08:07.410 --> 00:08:14.770
power, respect, good mental health, quality friends, a
diverse network, a thriving business, a prolific career. You

72
00:08:16.520 --> 00:08:22.510
will get and keep none of those things without proper
communication skills. It doesn't matter what language you're

73
00:08:22.510 --> 00:08:29.520
speaking. Actually, it does, because we communicate
differently in different languages. If you want to

74
00:08:29.520 --> 00:08:35.560
communicate effectively, then you've got to know how to
think productively. And to do that, you'll need to know how

75
00:08:35.560 --> 00:08:42.600
to write and then analyze what you've written. You can't
make the operating system -- that is your brain -- run more

76
00:08:42.600 --> 00:08:48.710
effectively without analyzing it first. Right? It's the same
thing when you're learning English as a foreign language.

77
00:08:49.760 --> 00:08:56.210
Most people can't speak English because they can't think in
English and they can't think in English because they never

78
00:08:56.210 --> 00:09:02.910
trained themselves to produce thoughts in English. They just
try to memorize words or translate every sentence from their

79
00:09:02.910 --> 00:09:09.370
native language to English whenever they speak. But I
promise you, if you take the time to develop your ability to

80
00:09:09.370 --> 00:09:17.110
listen, analyze, and think, then you'll be able to develop
your ability to communicate. And with good communication

81
00:09:17.110 --> 00:09:25.380
skills, you can have whatever your heart desires. If you
don't believe me, consider your favorite singer or rapper.

82
00:09:27.080 --> 00:09:34.130
Their song lyrics get you through the good times and the bad
times. Their words make you laugh, cry, reflect, dance, and

83
00:09:34.130 --> 00:09:41.960
maybe even feel better about yourself. You identify with
them and feel like they understand you in some way. Somehow

84
00:09:41.960 --> 00:09:49.530
they describe your feelings and personal life in ways that
you never could. And how do they do this? By communicating,

85
00:09:50.480 --> 00:09:57.550
by writing songs. They choose words, phrases, sentences, and
verses to creatively get their message across to their

86
00:09:57.550 --> 00:10:04.360
intended listener. And when they do this effectively, they
have the ability to move millions of people with nothing

87
00:10:04.360 --> 00:10:13.000
more than their words. Do you know how many people would
jump out of an airplane if Drake told them to do it? Do you

88
00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:20.340
know how many people would buy a tube of lipstick if Rihanna
told them to do it? We're talking literally millions of

89
00:10:20.340 --> 00:10:26.180
people around the world. And you might say, "Well, that's
because they're famous entertainers. Of course, people will

90
00:10:26.180 --> 00:10:35.430
do what they say." But how did they reach that level of fame
and recognition? Communication skills. From writing songs to

91
00:10:35.430 --> 00:10:42.230
recording music videos to interacting on social media. All
of them are just different forms of communication. People

92
00:10:42.230 --> 00:10:47.610
like Drake and Rihanna would not live in the hearts and
minds of millions of people if they didn't have great

93
00:10:47.610 --> 00:10:53.800
communication skills. And the good news for you is that you
don't need to be able to write songs and perform on a stage

94
00:10:53.800 --> 00:10:59.740
to have the same effect. You can use your communication
skills to win friends and influence people in your daily

95
00:10:59.740 --> 00:11:06.140
life, whether you're at work, the grocery store, the local
bar, or somewhere overseas. You will get what you want by

96
00:11:06.140 --> 00:11:12.280
knowing how to speak and listen effectively. And the only
way to learn how to do those things is by learning how to

97
00:11:12.280 --> 00:11:19.570
think effectively. So if you're having trouble thinking
effectively, consider learning how to write.

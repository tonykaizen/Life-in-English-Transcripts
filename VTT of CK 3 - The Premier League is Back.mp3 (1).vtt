1
00:00:03.430 --> 00:00:04.950
Premier League is back, baby.

2
00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:11.030
Good morning, my friend.

3
00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:17.970
This is Coffee with Kaizen number three. Today is Monday,
August 16th, 2021.

4
00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:24.260
Today we're talking about the Premier League, man, because
it's finally back, bro. It's finally back. You know how long

5
00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:30.390
I've been waiting to watch another game of football for?
Like, months and months and months. Like, my life is not the

6
00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:32.250
same without football.

7
00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:38.260
You feel what I'm saying? So I'm extremely excited that
Premier League is back. Another round of Champions League is

8
00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:44.670
coming up soon. We're gonna have a lot of football, a lot of
good games, a lot of strong teams this year, at least in the

9
00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:51.390
Premier League. I don't really follow Spain or France or
Germany or Italy or any other, uh, countries. My focus is

10
00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:53.130
mainly on England.

11
00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:59.500
I'm a Man United fan, by the way. I know a lot of times you
see me with the PSG jacket on, but I'm not a PSG fan. Never

12
00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:05.120
have been. Never will be. You understand what I'm saying?
That jacket was actually given to me by a friend of mine

13
00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:08.930
from France. He's a PSG fan, so yeah.

14
00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:14.830
I just like the jacket, you know? But, um, anyway, neither
here nor there. I just want to talk a little bit about

15
00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:20.810
Premier League in general, you know, some couple updates and
things like that and then we'll get out of here, man. So

16
00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:28.130
first thing. Like I said before, I'm extremely excited that
the Premier League is finally back because 2020, as you

17
00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:35.530
know, it was such a strange year, man, for so many different
reasons. But one of the strangest things was to see all the

18
00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:42.390
players playing the games in the stadium with no fans. That
was the strangest thing to me like I don't know what you

19
00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:50.880
think, but watch...watching the game on TV in a stadium that
was built to hold like 50,000 people and there's nobody in

20
00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:57.780
there except the players, the ref and the coaching staff,
it's like, "This is strange." But what was cool about that

21
00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:03.310
is you could listen to the players and what they were saying
because obviously when you're watching a typical game with

22
00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:08.860
all the fans in the stadium, all you hear is the... the
commentators, right? But also the fans just screaming the

23
00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:15.690
entire game. But with nobody in the stadium, it was like
watching a training exercise almost. You could hear the

24
00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:22.480
players yelling back and forth to each other. That was
interesting. But the rest of it, you know, without the fans,

25
00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:29.300
it's just not the same, you know? Like when I was watching
Premier League and these guys are playing with no fans in

26
00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:35.880
the stadium, it just felt like 22 men kicking a ball around.
And that's essentially what football is, regardless of the

27
00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:44.260
situation. Even without the fans in the stadium, it's still
just 22 guys kicking the ball. But what makes it... Part of

28
00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:51.680
what makes it so exciting and interesting and I guess really
the main reason that these leagues exist is because there's

29
00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:58.180
fans willing to pay money to go see a great show, to go see
great talents, to go see a great game, right? So without the

30
00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:02.140
fans in the stadium kind of sucked.

31
00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:10.470
Not only that, but we...we all know the reason, the reason
that these fans couldn't be in the stadium last year

32
00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:17.150
because, you know, they didn't want people spreading
sickness around. Let's just say it that way. But even still,

33
00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:23.970
the players could be on the field playing the game and they
--in some cases--are even closer to each other than the fans

34
00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:27.360
would be in the stands, alright?

35
00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:35.950
So the fans can't come in and watch the game. The players,
no problem at all, you know? It's just kind of weird, right?

36
00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:42.370
You can feel how you want about 2020 and what happened and
what should not have happened and all that type of stuff,

37
00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:49.910
but kind of doesn't make sense the fans can't come in, but
the players can come in and play a contact sport. In a

38
00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:55.740
situation like that, it doesn't really make... I mean, it
does make sense because at the end of the day, the Premier

39
00:03:55.740 --> 00:04:02.120
League, Bundesliga, I mean, all the football leagues around
the world, they're businesses. All the football clubs are

40
00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:08.050
businesses at the end of the day. So it's like we're not
going to let the fans in, but we need to make our money so

41
00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:13.960
let's play these games, let's finish this season so we can
get on to the next one, right? I'm just saying it was

42
00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:20.780
really, really weird to see football with no fans in the
stadium. I'm super excited. I was so happy to turn on the TV

43
00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:27.100
this weekend and see fans in the stadium. Everybody smiling,
happy, cheering cause that's what it's about, man, right? I

44
00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:34.360
mean, to be able to go out and enjoy the game, that's super
cool. Now, weekend results. Let's go over the weekend

45
00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:40.540
results, you know? I got to be honest, I'm pretty happy
about the results because, you know, Man United did that

46
00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:47.920
thing, boy. So on Friday, August 13th, that was the first
game of the season. Brentford versus Arsenal. Brentford beat

47
00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:54.750
Arsenal, two nil. And I got to say, man, nothing makes me
happy. There's only one thing that makes me happier than

48
00:04:54.750 --> 00:05:01.890
seeing Arsenal lose and I'll tell you what that is in just a
second, but it makes me so happy to see Arsenal lose, you

49
00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:08.340
know? And you're probably like, "Why do you hate Arsenal?
What the fuck, bro?" I just...I don't like them. I don't

50
00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:12.900
like Arsenal. I really don't. I really, really don't. It
just makes me happy to see them lose. They're actually one

51
00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:17.500
of our rivals. A lot of people probably don't know that, but
Arsenal is a rival of Man United. But anyway,

52
00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.210
Brentford-Arsenal two-nil or 2-0.

53
00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:30.180
Brentford beat Arsenal two nil the word "nil" in this
context means zero, alright? Next, Man United versus Leeds

54
00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:34.970
United five to one, you know what I'm saying?

55
00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:43.150
Man United was looking good, boy, real talk. Man United was
looking real good on Saturday morning. I got to say, goal

56
00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:50.370
scorers Bruno Fernandes, hat trick, Mason Greenwood, Fred
getting on the scoresheet, man, we were looking really,

57
00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:55.810
really good. Now, as a Man United fan, you know, if you
follow Premier League, if you know about football, you know,

58
00:05:55.810 --> 00:06:01.960
like since 2014, Man United has just been going through some
shit, bro.

59
00:06:02.050 --> 00:06:03.800
Like we lost Fergie.

60
00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:10.780
Then who came after that? I think it was Louis van Gaal,
JosÃ© Mourinho, you know? A lot of talented players came and

61
00:06:10.780 --> 00:06:17.840
went: Angel Di Maria, Lukaku- who's now at Chelsea. Man,
we're going to talk about that in a second. But I'm just

62
00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:25.970
saying, Man United has had a few...tough few years. Like,
for real, we've been kinda going this way with it. Up and

63
00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:32.770
down, up and down, up and down. But, uh, it finally looks
like slowly we're getting back on track. We signed some good

64
00:06:32.770 --> 00:06:37.630
players, we can see the intentions of the owners who are
buying these players, you know what I mean? We're really

65
00:06:37.630 --> 00:06:43.660
trying to rebuild the squad. All the gunner is at the head
of the team, man. And I really think... I really, really,

66
00:06:43.660 --> 00:06:49.640
really think we have a chance of winning the league this
year. It's not going to be easy because a lot of other teams

67
00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:57.560
have strengthened their forces. But, got to believe, right? 
So, Man United beat Leeds United five to one. Leicester City

68
00:06:57.560 --> 00:07:04.060
beat the Wolves, one to zero. Chelsea beat Crystal Palace
three-nil. They're looking really good this year. Watford

69
00:07:04.210 --> 00:07:13.610
beat Aston Villa three-two. Everton beat Southampton three
to one. Burnley lost to Brighton, two to one. Norwich lost

70
00:07:13.610 --> 00:07:22.050
to Liverpool, they won by three. It was three to nil. Three
to nil. It was three-nil. (laughs) Don't say three to nil.

71
00:07:22.100 --> 00:07:28.800
That sounds weird. I just heard myself say that, sounds
weird. So Liverpool beat Norwich three-nil. West Ham beat

72
00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:34.940
Newcastle four-two and Tottenham beat Man City one-nil.

73
00:07:35.480 --> 00:07:42.600
And I said a second ago, nothing makes me... almost nothing
makes me happier than seeing Arsenal lose. Nothing makes me

74
00:07:42.600 --> 00:07:49.800
happier than seeing Manchester City lose, dog, like, for
real. Like when you... You know how people they see puppies

75
00:07:50.130 --> 00:07:55.450
or they see babies and things like that on the internet and
they're like, "Oh, that's so sweet." You know, warms their

76
00:07:55.450 --> 00:08:02.330
heart, makes them feel good on the inside, that's exactly
how I feel when I see Manchester City lose, like, for real.

77
00:08:02.780 --> 00:08:11.040
Nothing makes me happier in the context of football,
obviously. Nothing makes me happier. Fuck City, you know

78
00:08:11.160 --> 00:08:18.300
what I'm saying? Like, for real, bro? Nothing makes me
happier. No, I'm not a Tottenham fan. But anybody who beats

79
00:08:18.300 --> 00:08:24.780
Manchester City- much love and respect, you know what I'm
saying? I love watching City lose, bro. I can't explain it.

80
00:08:24.780 --> 00:08:30.400
I can't express it. But anyway, back to the teams that are
looking strong this year. Man United, like I said, is

81
00:08:30.400 --> 00:08:34.590
looking really strong, you know? We signed some good
players. I don't think we're ever going to look like the old

82
00:08:34.590 --> 00:08:41.400
Manchester United, you know? Back when Wazza was playing,
Ronaldo's playing, you know? I don't think we'll ever get

83
00:08:41.400 --> 00:08:48.880
back to that level, you know what I mean? The past is the
past. We'll never have that team again. However, I do think

84
00:08:49.150 --> 00:08:54.930
that we're starting to look a lot more like the Man United
of the past. The main problem that we have had over the

85
00:08:54.930 --> 00:09:01.310
years, even last year, is consistency. Like we've always had
talented players, even last year, I mean, we finished second

86
00:09:01.820 --> 00:09:07.820
last year and really it was only the second half of the
season that got us up to that level when we signed Bruno and

87
00:09:07.820 --> 00:09:12.310
we looked like a different team, you know what I mean? So
for Man United, I just think it's consistency because we

88
00:09:12.310 --> 00:09:18.990
have a ridiculous amount of talented players, especially
attacking players, you know what I mean? But you know who

89
00:09:18.990 --> 00:09:25.820
else looks really strong? It's Chelsea, surprisingly, man. I
mean, and now they signed Lukaku. They're looking really,

90
00:09:25.890 --> 00:09:31.810
really, really good this year. Really good. They also have a
lot of talented players. I like their style of play and now

91
00:09:31.810 --> 00:09:37.230
that they got Lukaku, man, I think they are a force to be
reckoned with, like for real. And I'm actually kind of

92
00:09:37.230 --> 00:09:44.340
disappointed that it didn't work out with Lukaku at United
and I think that was maybe three years ago. And there's a

93
00:09:44.340 --> 00:09:51.410
lot of cases like that. When you think about United's
history, we had Lukaku, lost him, we had Di Maria, lost him,

94
00:09:51.460 --> 00:09:56.870
Memphis Depay as well, a very talented player, lost him. I
feel like there's some other ones I just can't think of

95
00:09:56.870 --> 00:10:02.400
them. But still we've had a lot of talented players come in
to Man United and then leave for whatever reason. Maybe it

96
00:10:02.400 --> 00:10:09.220
was relationships with the...the manager at the time,
coaches, we have no idea. But imagine the Man United with

97
00:10:09.280 --> 00:10:17.100
Angel Di Maria still, you know what I mean? I was really sad
when we lost him after just one year. One year man. Now,

98
00:10:17.200 --> 00:10:22.910
lastly, I just want to talk really quick about what I think
makes the Premier League so special, man, because there's

99
00:10:22.960 --> 00:10:27.360
really nothing like it on Earth. There's other great leagues
around the world, other great players and things like that,

100
00:10:27.670 --> 00:10:35.430
great competitions, but the Premier League...the Premier
League is just special, I think because one, the style of

101
00:10:35.430 --> 00:10:43.760
football, you know, it's very attack centric, you know, in
England, in my opinion, the attacking football is a very

102
00:10:44.140 --> 00:10:50.180
notable characteristic. When you watch English Premier
League, you're going to see attack, attack, attack, attack,

103
00:10:50.470 --> 00:10:57.000
maybe not so much strategic controlling of the game through
possession and things like that, although there are a few

104
00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:05.600
teams like Manchester City who do that extremely well. Most
teams and most players is like attack, attack, attack the

105
00:11:05.600 --> 00:11:12.140
entire game, you know what I mean? And I think that's part
of it but also just the diversity in the league. Now, I know

106
00:11:12.140 --> 00:11:17.320
that there's diversity in other leagues around the world,
but in the Premier League, you see players from all over the

107
00:11:17.380 --> 00:11:23.060
world playing together. I mean, if you just look at
Manchester City or at United or at Chelsea, these different

108
00:11:23.060 --> 00:11:30.360
players with different styles and abilities from all over
the world. Whereas in many other countries, every player on

109
00:11:30.360 --> 00:11:36.010
the team is from the same country. Now, I'm not saying that
what country you're from makes a huge difference. You know,

110
00:11:36.110 --> 00:11:40.220
in your football, at the end of the day, you're the
individual that has to play. But I think it has something to

111
00:11:40.220 --> 00:11:46.320
do with it. And you can see that in the World Cup, like it's
partly the manager, but the players. The German players have

112
00:11:46.320 --> 00:11:52.370
a certain style and energy, Spanish players, Brazilian
players, American players. I think each team has their own

113
00:11:52.370 --> 00:11:58.950
identity and the fact that they're all from the same country
has something to do with that, I think, you know? But I just

114
00:11:58.950 --> 00:12:04.680
think that's one of the things that makes it so special is
you have players from all over the world playing on these

115
00:12:04.680 --> 00:12:11.250
teams. It's just insane levels of talent, insane levels of
attack. It's high energy most of the time from start to

116
00:12:11.250 --> 00:12:17.370
finish. And not only that, but it's one of those leagues
that every weekend it doesn't matter who's playing. It could

117
00:12:17.370 --> 00:12:25.320
be the team in position number one on the table versus team
in position number twenty. And the lowest team in the league

118
00:12:25.320 --> 00:12:31.010
could beat the best team in the league any weekend, any
time. It doesn't matter. It's really not about that. And you

119
00:12:31.010 --> 00:12:37.750
could see a game between like Manchester City and, you know,
Brighton or West Brom and you think, "Oh, Manchester City's

120
00:12:37.750 --> 00:12:43.670
gonna beat them three or four to zero." You know what I'm
saying? But you really never know. It happens all the time.

121
00:12:43.670 --> 00:12:50.770
Some of the lowest teams in the league beat the best teams,
the highest teams in the league every weekend. And I think

122
00:12:50.770 --> 00:12:56.320
that's really what I'm trying to say is there's so much
competition. The level of competition is so high. Nobody

123
00:12:56.320 --> 00:13:03.680
cares that you're Manchester United or Chelsea or Arsenal.
You could lose any week and there's no guaranteed results in

124
00:13:03.680 --> 00:13:09.080
the Premier League ever. And I think that's why it's so
popular, because it's so exciting. You just never know

125
00:13:09.080 --> 00:13:15.210
what's gonna happen. You never know who's going to score,
what upsets are going to happen and stuff like that. So

126
00:13:15.210 --> 00:13:20.530
there's a lot of talented managers, a lot of talented
players, high energy, lots of attack, and you just never

127
00:13:20.530 --> 00:13:26.890
know what's gonna happen. I think that's what makes the
Premier League so special. Alright, my friend, that's it for

128
00:13:26.890 --> 00:13:32.320
now, man. I talked way more than I expected to, but I just
love football. I love the Premier League. I could talk for

129
00:13:32.320 --> 00:13:36.770
three more hours about it. If I would have written some
notes and prepared and shit like that, we could, we could

130
00:13:36.770 --> 00:13:43.880
talk all week about Premier League. I should start a damn
soccer podcast or something like that. I love soccer so

131
00:13:43.880 --> 00:13:48.580
much, man. And if you are a fan of Premier League or just
soccer in general, or if you have any thoughts and opinions,

132
00:13:48.600 --> 00:13:53.810
do not be afraid. Shoot me a message on social or start a
conversation or leave a comment below. If you're watching

133
00:13:53.810 --> 00:13:59.970
this on YouTube, do not be afraid to make comments, send
messages, leave your opinions, you know? Do what you do,

134
00:13:59.970 --> 00:14:06.390
man. Let's start a conversation because I love football. I
could talk about it all day, every day. But anyway, that's

135
00:14:06.390 --> 00:14:10.540
Coffee with Kaizen number three. And I'll see you tomorrow.
Peace!

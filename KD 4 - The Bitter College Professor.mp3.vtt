00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:01.190
Tony Kaizen:
What's up, my friend?

2
00:00:01.190 --> 00:00:06.200
In this episode of Kaizen after Dark,
we're going to listen to the NFL quarterback Aaron Rodgers

3
00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:12.120
tell a story about a bitter and spiteful college professor
he had back in the day. And just in case you're not familiar

4
00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:18.080
with Aaron Rodgers, he's currently the quarterback of the
American football team, the Green Bay Packers. That name

5
00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:23.370
might sound a little strange to you, but the name of the
team is really 'The Packers', and they're based in the city

6
00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:29.720
of Green Bay, Wisconsin. But anyway, in this episode, you're
going to hear Aaron talk about the time that one of his

7
00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:36.310
college professors purposely gave him a failing grade and
tried to get him expelled from school. And just in case you

8
00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:43.240
don't know, the word "expelled" in this case means to force
someone to leave and never come back. So if you're expelled

9
00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:50.110
from school, they basically ban you from being a student
forever. So, let's get right into this clip so you can hear

10
00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:53.340
exactly what Aaron did to make this woman so angry.

11
00:00:56.210 --> 00:01:04.580
Aaron Rodgers:
And one of my favorite stories about somebody who didn't
believe in me was I had this teacher at Cal and I wrote this

12
00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:07.750
paper in a food appreciation class.

13
00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:10.130
That was the class...food appreciation.

14
00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:11.190
Interviewer:
I could go to that class.

15
00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:20.430
Aaron Rodgers:
And there was like 15 nf, 15... 15 kids on the team in that
class, class of like, let's say 120 people, right? And I

16
00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:28.380
wrote a paper and she said I cited incorrectly. So we had
these breakout classes, um, of the 120, there'd be like six

17
00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:37.520
breakout classes of 20. So in my class of 20,uh, let's say
15, it was like three fourths. So 15 of the kids didn't cite

18
00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:43.660
it exactly how she said. 14 of 'em got to rewrite the paper,
not me.

19
00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:52.060
So I said, "Okay, I'm gonna, I'm gonna go see her at her...
at her hours.", right? So at Cal, we, we had practice at 2

20
00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:56.720
o'clock, so you had to be up top at the football facility at
2 o'clock. So I told my quarterback coach, "I'm going to be

21
00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:03.230
late this day. I got to go to the teacher's hours, which
start at 2 o'clock." So I went to her office and she was

22
00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:10.090
ready for me. She had my paper out. I said, "Look, I'm not
asking for a special privilege here, but the other 14 kids

23
00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:17.470
who got, who got an F on the paper got to rewrite the paper
and I didn't." And she ripped me apart. "You are an entitled

24
00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:22.520
athlete. You expect things to be given to you. What are you
gonna do with your life?" I said, "I'm gonna play in the

25
00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:24.890
NFL." She said, "No way in hell."

26
00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:26.690
Interviewer:
No way in hell?

27
00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:29.330
Aaron Rodgers:
"You won't make it. You'll get hurt. You'll never make it."

28
00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:29.600
Interviewer:
Whoa.

29
00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:35.410
Aaron Rodgers:
"You will need your education and you will never make it.
And what I've seen from you is you won't amount to

30
00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:35.840
anything."

31
00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:37.400
Interviewer:
Oh my god.

32
00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:39.500
Aaron Rodgers:
And I said, "Watch me."

33
00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:42.270
Interviewer:
What a terrible thing to say to a kid.

34
00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:50.210
Aaron Rodgers:
So big props to that, uh, food appreciation teacher at Cal
for trying to... trying to ruin, you know, my life and my

35
00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:52.290
dreams and you just gave me some ammo.

36
00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:59.800
Tony Kaizen:
If you're reading the transcript, it's probably much easier
to follow Aaron's story. But just in case it's still not

37
00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:06.860
clear, I'm gonna summarize what's been said so far. So Aaron
had to write an essay for his food appreciation class

38
00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:13.310
--whatever the fuck that is-- and his professor said that he
and some other students hadn't followed the instructions

39
00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:19.750
correctly, so they got a failing grade. But the problem was
that the professor had decided to let everyone except Aaron

40
00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:27.210
rewrite the paper and get a passing grade. Aaron was the
only one who had to accept his failing grade. This was

41
00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:33.020
obviously unfair so Aaron decided to go and speak with that
professor after class. But when he sat down to speak with

42
00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:39.780
her, he realized that she was intentionally trying to make
his life harder and give him failing grades. The professor

43
00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:44.940
didn't like Aaron because she thought he was spoiled,
privileged and that he expected everything to be done for

44
00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:50.850
him because he was a talented college athlete. That might
not make sense to you if you don't know how universities

45
00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:56.780
work here in the US. But many people believe that star
university athletes get special treatment because they're

46
00:03:56.780 --> 00:04:02.670
essentially like local celebrities. Now, Aaron's professor
ultimately asked him what he was planning to do with his

47
00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:07.900
life, and when he said he was gonna be a professional
football player, she told him that he had absolutely no

48
00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:16.430
chance of becoming a pro and that he would never be anyone
significant in this world. Now why she said that to him? I

49
00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:22.160
suppose only she knows...but according to Aaron, all that
did was give him another source of motivation to reach his

50
00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:24.550
goal. But let's keep listening to hear the rest of the
story.

51
00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:35.710
Aaron Rodgers:
Big props to that, uh, food appreciation teacher at Cal for
trying to... trying to ruin, you know, my life and my dreams

52
00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:37.330
and you just gave me some ammo.

53
00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:43.270
Interviewer:
But what a just irresponsible way to communicate with
someone who's young and has their whole life ahead of them.

54
00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:47.930
But then again, that's part of the problem is that people
who don't have their whole life ahead of them anymore and

55
00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:55.010
then they see people coming up and they, they get upset.
They're upset by people that they deem to be privileged. Are

56
00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:58.370
they deemed to have a better place in life than they had?

57
00:04:58.700 --> 00:05:04.520
Aaron Rodgers:
The crazy thing is, I was probably the best athlete student
in that class. And the one who was actually trying to take

58
00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:05.090
it seriously.

59
00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:07.550
Interviewer:
So she did, she specifically singled you out

60
00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:07.640
Aaron Rodgers:
Yep.

61
00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:11.030
Interviewer:
just because you're an athlete and didn't allow you to... So
she wanted to damage...

62
00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:17.710
Aaron Rodgers:
And the best part is so, so I'm late to my CUBI meeting and
I have a meeting after practice that day with the...the

63
00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:22.760
liaison. He was,I don't know what his exact title was, but
he was the liaison between the players and the school,

64
00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:28.330
basically. And I said, "Hey, look, here's what happened. I
went in this office..." I told the whole story, you know? I

65
00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:34.380
was trying to get the same treatment as the other 14 kids
who got to rewrite the paper and she kind of ripped my ass

66
00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:42.140
and, and was a little derogatory. I didn't think that was,
you know, fair or appropriate.

67
00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:48.230
They brought some heat down on her so she had a vendetta
against me. At the end of the semester, she wrote up a

68
00:05:48.230 --> 00:05:58.030
3-page paper trying to get me, uh, expelled from campus. I
had to go in front of the Judicial Affairs Board at Cal in

69
00:05:58.030 --> 00:06:03.510
like something like kangaroo court and ended up having to
write...

70
00:06:03.980 --> 00:06:12.320
it was two options one, expulsion or two, I could write an
apology letter to this teacher. She like, made up all this

71
00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:19.700
great...said I was late to class every day, I was
disruptive. I literally was on time every day, sat in the

72
00:06:19.700 --> 00:06:25.860
middle of the row and was probably one of the only football
players actually taking notes and paying attention.

73
00:06:28.130 --> 00:06:29.040
Interviewer:
So she just lied?

74
00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:29.350
Aaron Rodgers:
Yeah.

75
00:06:29.890 --> 00:06:33.640
Interviewer:
Wow. (laughs) Maybe she had a thing with football players.

76
00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:35.180
Aaron Rodgers:
I dunno. (laugh)

77
00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:39.470
Interviewer:
Just, that's, it's so sad that there's people like that out
there. That...

78
00:06:39.740 --> 00:06:42.180
Aaron Rodgers:
But that's social... Isn't that social media to an extent
now?

79
00:06:42.180 --> 00:06:42.800
Interviewer:
Yes. Yeah.

80
00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:50.170
Aaron Rodgers:
It's people who are upset and bitter and want to be offended
by something and so they'll do anything to, like, make

81
00:06:50.170 --> 00:06:55.580
themselves feel better. If I can put somebody down, if I can
rip somebody apart, if I can find somebody offended about.

82
00:06:56.350 --> 00:06:58.340
And then, yeah, away we go.

83
00:06:58.510 --> 00:07:00.790
Interviewer:
That's that old expression, right? Hurt people hurt people.

84
00:07:00.930 --> 00:07:01.050
Aaron Rodgers:
Yeah.

85
00:07:01.130 --> 00:07:04.200
Interviewer:
She's a damaged lady and she decided to take it out on you.
(laughs)

86
00:07:04.410 --> 00:07:05.970
Aaron Rodgers:
Took it out on the wrong person though.

87
00:07:09.790 --> 00:07:15.050
Tony Kaizen:
Alright, my friend. Let me summarize the second half of this
story for you. So once Aaron realized that his college

88
00:07:15.050 --> 00:07:21.180
professor was out to get him, he decided to let some school
officials know what was happening. Now, this resulted in the

89
00:07:21.180 --> 00:07:27.620
professor being reprimanded by her superiors, which only
made her hate Aaron even more. Now, in an effort to seek

90
00:07:27.620 --> 00:07:35.370
revenge on Aaron, this bitter college professor wrote a
3-page paper explaining why Aaron should be expelled from

91
00:07:35.370 --> 00:07:43.100
the university. She lied and said that Aaron was a horrible
student, always late and always disruptive in class. As a

92
00:07:43.100 --> 00:07:50.940
result, Aaron was forced to choose between writing an
apology letter to the professor or being expelled from the

93
00:07:50.940 --> 00:07:57.000
university. And mind you, this is all because he simply
asked the woman why he couldn't rewrite his essay like the

94
00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:03.600
rest of the students. Now, we must acknowledge the fact that
we haven't heard the professor's side of this story. But

95
00:08:03.600 --> 00:08:10.270
assuming that everything Aaron said was true, I can't help
but wonder what it was that made this college professor so

96
00:08:10.270 --> 00:08:12.620
spiteful, you know?

97
00:08:13.620 --> 00:08:19.900
What exactly has she experienced in life that made her want
to bring other people down and make them as miserable as she

98
00:08:19.900 --> 00:08:27.310
was? Now, maybe it's a waste of time to think about stuff
like that, but I still find it interesting. Well, what we do

99
00:08:27.310 --> 00:08:32.750
know is that although this experience might have caused
Aaron some trouble at the time, it certainly didn't stop him

100
00:08:32.750 --> 00:08:38.870
from reaching his goal. He became the quarterback of the
Green Bay Packers and even won the Super Bowl championship

101
00:08:38.870 --> 00:08:46.400
back in 2011. So let this be a lesson to you, my friend.
When you're trying to level up in life, there will

102
00:08:46.530 --> 00:08:51.760
undoubtedly be some people who don't want to see you
succeed. There will be people who try to discourage you,

103
00:08:52.590 --> 00:08:59.280
tear you down and make you feel like a loser. And this is
not something you can control. Now, what you can control,

104
00:08:59.280 --> 00:09:07.560
though, is how you respond to all that hatred. You can let
it stop you from going after what you want or you can use it

105
00:09:07.560 --> 00:09:14.270
as a source of motivation to work even harder and prove to
yourself that you are capable of achieving success in life.

106
00:09:14.270 --> 00:09:20.990
I want to thank you so much for your time and your
attention, my friend. I hope you enjoyed this episode of

107
00:09:20.990 --> 00:09:22.530
Kaizen after Dark.

108
00:09:22.920 --> 00:09:27.240
There are many, many more coming soon and I will talk to you
soon. Peace.

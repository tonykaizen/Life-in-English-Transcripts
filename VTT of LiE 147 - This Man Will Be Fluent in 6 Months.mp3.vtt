00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:07.080
I want to introduce you to a Turkish man named Alex who has set a big goal for himself. It's a goal that I not only

2
00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:14.620
support, but it's also a goal that I genuinely believe he's
capable of achieving. And that goal is to speak English

3
00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:16.820
fluently in six months.

4
00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:29.880
Alex recently tagged me in one of his TikTok videos in which
he explained how he uses my video lessons to learn new

5
00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:36.420
English words. So out of curiosity, I went to his profile
and clicked on his very first video and I'm going to play

6
00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:37.030
that video now.

7
00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:43.980
Alex:
Hi, guys. I promised myself.

8
00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:55.430
That is become a fluent speaker in English. Also, I want to
understand English TV series

9
00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:57.750
without subtitles.

10
00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:02.300
My level is A1 or A2.

11
00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:12.790
I...honestly, I don't understand English videos or English
content exactly.

12
00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:23.820
My goal is to become fluent speaker and also,

13
00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:30.300
I want to achieve that in just six months.

14
00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:41.190
Now, I'm speaking English without any context. I'm recording
this video for my improvements

15
00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:52.050
in English. Also, I want to see, I want to share this
process of my English.

16
00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:57.150
You can follow me and check my English.

17
00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:06.060
I will share...I will continue sharing new videos, sharing
my process.

18
00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:09.350
Thank you for watching.

19
00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:18.320
First of all, Alex, if you're listening to this, I want you
to know you are fucking awesome, man. You've only just

20
00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:24.400
gotten started on your journey, but I'm already proud of
you. Now, why am I sharing Alex's videos with you today?

21
00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:31.140
Well, first, I'd like you guys to go follow and support Alex
on his mission to become fluent in English. So check him out

22
00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:33.930
on TikTok at Englishin6months.

23
00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:44.350
That is the word "English", E-n-g-l-i-s-h; the word "in",
i-n; the number 6; and the word "months",

24
00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:51.400
m-o-n-t-h-s. That's Englishin6months and I'll leave a link
to his profile.

25
00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:58.800
I forgot the word. I'll leave a link to his profile in the
description for this episode. Now, the second reason I'm

26
00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:04.910
sharing these videos with you is so that you can see a
perfect example of someone who has decided to just live his

27
00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:06.250
life in English.

28
00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:13.240
He's at a beginner level. He has no teacher. He's not paying
for any courses. And he's not traveling to a foreign

29
00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:21.090
country. He simply set a goal for himself, and now he's
using four simple tools to achieve it. And those tools are

30
00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:26.260
creativity, energy, effort, and the Internet.

31
00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:34.820
So the first one, creativity. He's creating some form of
content to document his journey, right? Each one of these

32
00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:41.470
videos is a piece of content. It's like a video diary. So
you might not think of it as creative work, but he is

33
00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:50.360
creating videos to document his journey. The second tool,
energy. And you can think of energy as time. Alex is

34
00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:56.560
investing time into his studies. He's making sure that he
dedicates a particular amount of time to studying and

35
00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:04.780
recording a new video every day. The third tool is effort,
and a lot of people will watch hours of lessons on YouTube

36
00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:12.690
or TV series on Netflix, and they believe they're learning
English. But this is a very passive way of learning that

37
00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:19.520
doesn't require much effort. It's like watching the
highlights of a soccer game and thinking that alone is going

38
00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:26.900
to make you a great soccer player. Active learning requires
real effort. So instead of just watching a TV series, you

39
00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:33.300
should take notes, search for definitions and examples, talk
to an English speaker who can explain context and culture,

40
00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:42.600
and then find a way to put that new information into
practice. And the fourth tool, the Internet. If you're

41
00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:47.840
listening to this right now is because you have access to
the Internet. And the Internet can either be a tool or a

42
00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:54.220
toy, depending on how you use it. At the moment, Alex is
using the Internet not just to be entertained, but to be

43
00:04:54.220 --> 00:05:01.350
educated. So in these next few clips, you're going to see
how Alex uses a simple method for learning new vocabulary

44
00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:05.390
and improving his speaking skills every day. Let's do it.

45
00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:17.770
I tried to say in English what I will do. I am telling my
thoughts in English.

46
00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:23.410
In this way, I'm learning new words.

47
00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:35.180
In addition, I am practicing immediately. I don't know how
to say, "My T-shirt is

48
00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:41.410
ironed T-shirt." So I checked my dictionary.

49
00:05:41.410 --> 00:05:46.120
It is wrinkled t-shirt.

50
00:05:47.470 --> 00:05:56.910
So I...I have to iron my wrinkled T-shirt before

51
00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:00.010
wearing my T-shirt.

52
00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:04.890
Now I'm ironing my T-shirt.

53
00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:11.260
I like to wear ironed clothes.

54
00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:20.770
Now, I know you guys can't see the videos right now, but as
you heard, Alex was ironing his T-shirt and he wanted to

55
00:06:20.770 --> 00:06:26.190
talk about it in English. And when he came across the word
he didn't know how to say in English, he stopped what he was

56
00:06:26.190 --> 00:06:32.430
doing, searched for it, and then continued ironing his
shirt. And now he's learned a new word through real

57
00:06:32.430 --> 00:06:40.710
experience, not just a video on TikTok or YouTube that he's
going to forget within the next 24 hours. And he's so much

58
00:06:40.710 --> 00:06:46.900
more likely to remember the word. And I'm sure he had a lot
more fun learning it in real life, as opposed to watching a

59
00:06:46.900 --> 00:06:53.360
video and then writing the words down in a notebook and then
reading those words again and again. Now, obviously, if

60
00:06:53.380 --> 00:06:57.660
that's the way you prefer to learn, then there's nothing
wrong with that. But if you've been following me for a

61
00:06:57.660 --> 00:07:04.060
while, then you already know. My philosophy is that you
should simply live your life, and life will inevitably teach

62
00:07:04.060 --> 00:07:10.920
you the language. So let's check out a few more of Alex's
videos. In this one, he was making ice cream with his wife

63
00:07:10.920 --> 00:07:16.370
and he came across some more opportunities to learn useful
English vocabulary. Let's check it out.

64
00:07:20.710 --> 00:07:27.080
Hi, guys. I and my wife are making ice cream.

65
00:07:28.610 --> 00:07:37.110
Making ice cream is not my business, and my...my ambition is
speaking

66
00:07:38.490 --> 00:07:48.070
and practices English. Also, I...I want to learn new words
while we are making ice cream.

67
00:07:49.650 --> 00:07:53.010
I'm just helping her.

68
00:07:54.720 --> 00:07:58.160
I am mixing milk and cream.

69
00:08:00.170 --> 00:08:10.310
We made banana ice cream and strawberry ice cream, mulberry
ice

70
00:08:10.310 --> 00:08:19.610
cream. They will taste...are delicious, and we want to make
the

71
00:08:20.160 --> 00:08:30.010
chocolate ice cream and vanilla ice cream. While I am mixing
milk and chocolate, I'm

72
00:08:30.170 --> 00:08:32.670
learning new words.

73
00:08:33.250 --> 00:08:40.820
For example, I don't know the fire...fire things.

74
00:08:41.700 --> 00:08:46.990
Its so...it's called, um, stove?

75
00:08:47.550 --> 00:08:54.240
Yes. Gas stove. I'm using the gas stove all day.

76
00:08:54.700 --> 00:08:56.460
Also, my wife is...

77
00:08:57.900 --> 00:09:02.880
Especially my wife is using it.

78
00:09:05.070 --> 00:09:14.350
But I don't know how to say in English. I have learned and I
practice immediately.

79
00:09:19.380 --> 00:09:23.210
There are many words I have to learn.

80
00:09:24.590 --> 00:09:34.250
I think I am learning fast when I try to say my thoughts
like

81
00:09:34.370 --> 00:09:38.790
that. Also saying what I'm doing right now.

82
00:09:42.140 --> 00:09:52.090
Ingredients for making chocolate ice cream are Nutella,
milk, cream, and

83
00:09:52.980 --> 00:09:58.120
chocolate. Well, how to make ice cream?

84
00:09:59.030 --> 00:10:02.650
Really I don't know. My wife is making now.

85
00:10:03.570 --> 00:10:09.900
I'm watching and I'm looking forward to taste it.

86
00:10:11.870 --> 00:10:18.450
So, in this clip, you heard Alex himself talk about how he
noticed that he learns faster when he immediately puts a new

87
00:10:18.450 --> 00:10:25.420
word or phrase into practice and he tries to express his
thoughts verbally. So listen to this video that he made the

88
00:10:25.420 --> 00:10:25.830
next day.

89
00:10:29.390 --> 00:10:35.880
I and my wife made ice cream yesterday and we ate it. They
were delicious.

90
00:10:36.850 --> 00:10:46.820
When we were making ice...ice cream. I, I try to learn new
words, and immediately I want to apply

91
00:10:47.080 --> 00:10:52.210
it. So I have learned the meaning of stove.

92
00:10:53.350 --> 00:11:02.790
In this morning, I was watching TikTok videos. Tony was
talking about a phrasal verb in his videos

93
00:11:04.340 --> 00:11:13.170
and that is "watched pot never boils." He said "stove" in
its description.

94
00:11:14.590 --> 00:11:18.890
I got it, iTs meaning. I felt better.

95
00:11:20.090 --> 00:11:21.280
I understood.

96
00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:31.690
And by the way, I want to share a good news. Tony Kaizen has
start to follow me in TikTok, who

97
00:11:31.690 --> 00:11:35.390
is a famous teacher in TikTok.

98
00:11:36.490 --> 00:11:42.260
I have been following him in my other TikTok account.

99
00:11:43.660 --> 00:11:50.960
I'm so glad to him follow me. Thank you so much, Tony, for
sharing excellent videos.

100
00:11:51.730 --> 00:11:52.310
Thank you.

101
00:11:56.060 --> 00:12:02.250
Alright so, I really believe TikTok is constantly listening
to everything I'm saying and then trying to find videos

102
00:12:02.250 --> 00:12:08.740
related to what I've been talking about. Because there have
been countless times when I was talking about something, and

103
00:12:08.740 --> 00:12:15.950
a few minutes or hours later I see three or four videos
about that subject on TikTok and it's cool, but it's creepy

104
00:12:15.950 --> 00:12:21.030
as fuck at the same time. And you see Alex, you know, kind
of had the same experience, right? He learned the word

105
00:12:21.030 --> 00:12:27.100
"stove" and then saw that word in one of my videos the next
day. And that just goes to show you the benefit of

106
00:12:27.120 --> 00:12:33.460
constantly consuming the language and then immediately
trying to use it in real life. Like eventually, you're going

107
00:12:33.460 --> 00:12:39.140
to start to hear the same words and phrases all the time,
and you'll quickly memorize them without having to study for

108
00:12:39.310 --> 00:12:47.490
hours every day. And once you understand and know how to use
those daily words, you will have become conversational. And

109
00:12:47.490 --> 00:12:53.330
once you're conversational, you can learn any new words or
expressions with ease, my friend. But you've got to master

110
00:12:53.330 --> 00:13:01.900
the fundamentals first. And Alex is showing all of us how to
do it. Exactly that. Now in this next video, Alex talks

111
00:13:01.900 --> 00:13:07.820
about the effect that emotion has on your ability to learn
and remember things. So let's check it out.

112
00:13:10.280 --> 00:13:11.590
voice in the background:
"Wow. Yeah.

113
00:13:12.100 --> 00:13:13.020
Bitter pill..."

114
00:13:13.200 --> 00:13:19.870
Alex:
I watch videos for learning new words and phrasal verbs,
etc.

115
00:13:20.810 --> 00:13:30.720
I want to join these conversations. If I don't have any
words to say, if I don't have any idea, I just say

116
00:13:30.920 --> 00:13:35.040
"thank you". I typed "thank you for this video".

117
00:13:36.040 --> 00:13:45.700
She gave my answer for like "don't mention it". I don't know
"don't mention it" means. I...I was very surprised. I don't

118
00:13:45.790 --> 00:13:48.300
understand what she means.

119
00:13:49.510 --> 00:13:57.060
I checked the dictionary and I learned it's mean like "you
are welcome".

120
00:13:57.750 --> 00:14:03.200
Also, I knew many alternatives like that.

121
00:14:04.360 --> 00:14:13.510
I guess I will never forget it because I learned while I am
live

122
00:14:14.360 --> 00:14:19.100
in. I mean, I learned these words by living.

123
00:14:20.030 --> 00:14:21.280
I felt emotion.

124
00:14:22.520 --> 00:14:31.750
I need to more like that. I need to feel more emotion while
I am

125
00:14:32.210 --> 00:14:41.640
learning something. Because I don't live in the United
States or another country speak English.

126
00:14:42.840 --> 00:14:52.350
I don't have enough friends can speak English.
Unfortunately, I have to speak my little language

127
00:14:53.680 --> 00:14:54.970
in my jobs.

128
00:14:56.400 --> 00:15:02.640
Anyway, that's all. I'll try to practice all day.

129
00:15:04.020 --> 00:15:06.990
Thank you for watching. Have a good day.

130
00:15:09.660 --> 00:15:14.910
One of the main reasons people don't learn the language or
any other skill is because they tend to do it very

131
00:15:14.910 --> 00:15:22.580
passively. For example, you sit down and you watch a YouTube
video or a course online, or maybe you scroll on your phone,

132
00:15:22.580 --> 00:15:28.400
which doesn't require you to think or even speak like a
normal human being. You might even join an online community,

133
00:15:28.400 --> 00:15:35.430
but then you enter only to read messages and not to interact
with anyone. Which is fucking insane to me, bruh. I find it

134
00:15:35.430 --> 00:15:41.970
so interesting that even after opening up our Discord server
to any and everyone who wants to join, we've got hundreds of

135
00:15:41.970 --> 00:15:49.010
people on the server now, but there are only three or four
who actually show up to interact with people. You can lead a

136
00:15:49.010 --> 00:15:56.770
horse to water, but you cannot make the horse drink. And a
lot of you out there are sitting there staring at a river, a

137
00:15:56.770 --> 00:16:05.740
crystal clear, icy blue, fresh river of running water. But
you refuse to drink. My friends,

138
00:16:06.850 --> 00:16:13.720
Alex has done what so many are afraid to do. Without taking
any expensive courses, traveling to a foreign country or

139
00:16:13.720 --> 00:16:20.940
studying grammar for 6 hours a day, Alex has found a way to
live his life in English every day with virtually $0

140
00:16:20.940 --> 00:16:27.720
invested. And I say virtually zero because he already had a
phone and access to the Internet when he started. And that's

141
00:16:27.720 --> 00:16:34.590
all he needs to learn a language. Now, of course, there are
a bunch of great resources out there that one can pay for.

142
00:16:35.130 --> 00:16:40.090
And to be honest, the price isn't really the question,
because you can't really put a price on a proper education.

143
00:16:40.090 --> 00:16:46.330
I mean, that's what enables you to do anything and
everything you want and need in this life. Right? So it's

144
00:16:46.330 --> 00:16:55.410
really a question of effectiveness. What's the most
effective way to learn how to speak? Speak. Make mistakes,

145
00:16:56.080 --> 00:17:04.380
get corrected, and speak again. This is the simple process
of learning how to speak a language.

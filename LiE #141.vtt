00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:07.030
Wassup y'all! You're listening to another episode of Life in
English. I'm your host, Tony Kaizen. And this is an

2
00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:17.140
unordered list of reasons that YouTube is the future.
Alright,

3
00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:22.310
now, like I said, this list of reasons is in no particular
order. I just wrote them all down as I thought of them, and

4
00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:29.090
now I'm going to read them to you. So let's get started. The
first reason I got for you, the first reason that YouTube is

5
00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:36.270
the future and it will slowly but surely annihilate the
television, or at least network television, is that YouTube

6
00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:37.870
offers longevity.

7
00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:44.990
One of the most underrated features that makes YouTube great
is the ability to essentially host a video on the platform

8
00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:50.890
forever. Forever and for free, bro!

9
00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:57.540
And when I say forever, obviously, I mean until YouTube
doesn't exist anymore. And obviously I have no idea if this

10
00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:06.490
is true or not, but I just imagine YouTube will outlast you
and me in terms of years. Just my assumption. And even if

11
00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:14.310
that's not the case right now, today, you can watch videos
that were posted 12 years ago if you want. Can you turn on a

12
00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:22.110
TV and easily watch any and every episode of your favorite
show from 12 years ago? Just the fact that your videos can

13
00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:28.270
be watched an infinite number of times over decades is
something that no other platform has achieved. And somebody

14
00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:34.240
please correct me if I'm wrong, but outside of YouTube, I
can't think of any other platform that has done something

15
00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:42.580
like that. That's not some major news network or excuse me,
TV network or something like that. I can't think of one. And

16
00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:51.400
that takes me to my next point. YouTube is a search engine.
You can essentially find or learn just about anything you

17
00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:53.190
want on YouTube.

18
00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:59.130
Now, many people don't know that Google and YouTube are
owned by the same company, and both platforms function in a

19
00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:06.320
similar way, at least on the surface. When you want the
answer to a question or an explanation of a complex concept

20
00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:13.760
or recommendations for a restaurant in your area, what do
you do? You pull out your phone and type specific words in

21
00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:20.520
the Google search engine. And I think it's safe to say that
we all do the same thing on YouTube. When you want to see an

22
00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:26.000
explanation of a topic or a demonstration of an activity,
I'm willing to bet the first thing you do is pull out your

23
00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:33.860
phone and type some specific keywords on YouTube, hoping
that somebody has made a decent video about it. I know

24
00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:41.830
that's the case for me. Almost all the knowledge I possess
that's of any value was acquired on the tube. Either that or

25
00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:47.620
I just learned through pure trial and error, also known as
experience. And most of the time, some knowledge I gained

26
00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:53.390
after watching YouTube videos is what gave me the confidence
to go out there and get the experience. I hope that makes

27
00:02:53.390 --> 00:03:00.550
sense. Now the difference between Google and YouTube is
we're not just searching for information on YouTube. We're

28
00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:08.110
also searching for entertainment - from sports highlights to
vloggers, to talk shows, to podcasts, stunts, movies,

29
00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:14.790
interviews, and everything in between. YouTube really seems
limitless at times.

30
00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:19.750
There are literally millions of videos in the YouTube
ecosystem that I'll never know about because I'm not

31
00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:27.270
interested in those subjects. But the point is, they're out
there. There's room for everybody on YouTube, minus the

32
00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:34.010
select group of people that YouTube considers harmful to the
platform and its users obviously. But it doesn't matter if

33
00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:41.520
you're into biochemistry, DIY projects, soccer, cooking,
traveling, engineering, mathematics, entrepreneurship,

34
00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:50.410
anime, video games, makeup, psychology, philosophy, whatever
it is, there's a community of people making and watching

35
00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:59.880
videos about it on YouTube. Can we say the same thing about
network television? Now, another reason

36
00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:07.180
that YouTube is the future is that you have almost complete
control over the entire creative process. And before the

37
00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:13.300
Internet opened up to the masses, you would have to go
through a bunch of gatekeepers to get your content seen by

38
00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:16.490
the masses. And what's a gatekeeper?

39
00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:24.650
Well, the literal definition of gatekeeper is an attendant
at a gate who is paid to control who goes through that gate.

40
00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:31.490
So think like a doorman before a gate or a security guard
but they stand at the gate. That's the gatekeeper. But a

41
00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:38.400
more general way to use the word is when you mean to say
someone who controls access to something. For example, in

42
00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:45.060
the past, record labels acted as gatekeepers to the music
industry. They were the ones who decided which artists would

43
00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:50.700
get their music distributed around the world because in the
past, artists didn't have access to free distribution

44
00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:57.450
channels like they do today. So when you think social media,
you can really think distribution channel because that's

45
00:04:57.450 --> 00:05:05.990
really what it is in my opinion. But anyway, getting back to
my point, when the gatekeepers of the film, music, photo,

46
00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:13.040
book, and design industries had all the control, anyone who
wanted national or international distribution would have to

47
00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:19.360
be approved by the people who own the record label or the
publishing house or the art gallery or whatever. So if you

48
00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:26.930
didn't fit into the box they provided for you, you were
fucked. Because without distribution, no one will know your

49
00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:34.090
work exists. And if no one knows it exists, then you will
never be recognized for it, let alone compensated. But these

50
00:05:34.090 --> 00:05:42.740
days, you don't need to be approved by anyone but your
target audience. If you make videos, you get to decide the

51
00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:50.700
video thumbnail, right, which can be changed any time you
want. There's only one movie cover for every DVD or cassette

52
00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:56.540
tape or whatever. You can literally make a movie for
YouTube, decide that you don't like the cover, and change it

53
00:05:56.920 --> 00:06:02.250
any time you want, as many times as you want. You get to
decide the title, which you can also change if you want.

54
00:06:02.250 --> 00:06:08.040
There's no change in movie titles, but on YouTube you can.
It's your choice. You decide the video description, the

55
00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:14.870
video length, the editing style, which has a huge impact on
how the video is received. Right? The soundtrack, the

56
00:06:14.870 --> 00:06:21.040
language in which you recorded, or the language is in which
you record it, the subject matter of the video, it's all up

57
00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:27.770
to you. The only limit is your imagination. And the point is
that there are no more record labels or publishing houses

58
00:06:27.770 --> 00:06:36.810
putting limits on what message you can spread or how you
spread it. You can make a free account on YouTube, upload a

59
00:06:36.810 --> 00:06:44.280
video and click Publish. Not only are there no more
gatekeepers, there's no more fucking gate. You understand?

60
00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:53.610
The barrier to entry is the same for everyone now. And when
I say barrier to entry, I mean the obstacle between you and

61
00:06:53.610 --> 00:06:59.400
that field in which you want to be, right? A barrier is like
an obstacle, something keeping you from moving forward. So

62
00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:06.260
the barrier to entry -- figuratively speaking -- is whatever
stopping you from moving forward or getting involved. So

63
00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:12.060
these days, when it comes to content production and making
videos, podcasts or whatever, the barrier is so much lower

64
00:07:12.060 --> 00:07:20.880
than it has ever been. And it's the same for every human
being on the planet now. It's three things. Wi-Fi, a way to

65
00:07:20.880 --> 00:07:27.840
record audio, video or written words, and a fucking idea. 
That's it.

66
00:07:29.620 --> 00:07:34.250
That's literally it, bro. If somebody tells you that you
need more than that, they're either misinformed or they're

67
00:07:34.250 --> 00:07:40.510
trying to sell you some shit that you do not need. Take my
word on that one. Just trust me on it. That's all you need.

68
00:07:42.910 --> 00:07:47.740
That's not all you need but technically to get started,
that's all you need. Another thing that's extremely

69
00:07:47.740 --> 00:07:53.150
important is what brings me to my next point - the great
thing about YouTube and social media in general, but YouTube

70
00:07:53.150 --> 00:07:59.960
is just the king of them all, in my opinion, is that
creators get to connect with their audiences in a way that

71
00:07:59.960 --> 00:08:02.900
wasn't possible before. Right?

72
00:08:03.480 --> 00:08:10.690
In the past, the thing that drew us to celebrity actors is
the fact that we only saw them on TV. They captivated us

73
00:08:10.690 --> 00:08:16.310
with their performances on the movie screen but other than
the occasional, like, shallow interviews, we didn't really

74
00:08:16.310 --> 00:08:24.230
know anything about them. The mystique of the celebrity is
what made their presence so valuable, in my opinion. But

75
00:08:24.230 --> 00:08:31.860
nowadays, with the explosion of social media and vlogging,
what people appreciate is proximity. Being able to leave a

76
00:08:31.860 --> 00:08:37.760
comment on your favorite creator's video and have them
respond personally is something that wasn't really possible

77
00:08:37.760 --> 00:08:46.270
in the past. A video that lets you know what your favorite
creator or actor is doing at 9 a.m. on a Tuesday is now

78
00:08:46.270 --> 00:08:53.030
considered valuable content depending on who's making and
watching it. Social media has allowed us to speak directly

79
00:08:53.030 --> 00:09:00.090
to the people that want to listen to us. It's allowed us to
get direct feedback from the people for whom we are making

80
00:09:00.360 --> 00:09:06.760
our content. It's allowed us to get financial support from
the people who follow our work so that we can continue to

81
00:09:06.760 --> 00:09:14.780
produce the content. And that just wasn't possible before
the modern day Internet. Which takes me to my next point, or

82
00:09:14.780 --> 00:09:24.450
a reason that YouTube is certainly the future - and that is,
YouTube pays its creators. You can make

83
00:09:24.450 --> 00:09:34.290
money producing videos for YouTube, like, I told you before,
you need Wi-Fi, a way to record the content, and a

84
00:09:34.290 --> 00:09:40.870
fucking idea. That's what you need. And if you have those
three things and your ideas are good enough, and you can

85
00:09:40.870 --> 00:09:47.000
execute on the fucking idea, you can get paid. To make
YouTube videos.

86
00:09:49.200 --> 00:09:53.840
Like I say that, and you understand me, you get...it's like,
"Duh, it's fucking 2022, of course we know this!"

87
00:09:59.120 --> 00:10:07.910
But...YouTube pays its creators, bro! YouTube was smart
enough to understand that the video platform is worthless

88
00:10:07.960 --> 00:10:14.970
without a catalog of interesting videos to watch. So as a
way to incentivize great creators to publish videos that

89
00:10:14.970 --> 00:10:23.730
people actually want to watch on YouTube, they've created a
win-win-win situation. Viewers can always find new and

90
00:10:23.730 --> 00:10:31.060
interesting videos to watch, creators get paid for making
videos that viewers want to watch, and YouTube has videos to

91
00:10:31.060 --> 00:10:39.590
run their ads on and viewers to show those ads to. Everybody
wins. As far as I know, the same cannot be said for any

92
00:10:39.680 --> 00:10:45.960
other major content platform at the moment. On every other
platform your favorite content creators are busting their

93
00:10:46.100 --> 00:10:54.520
asses to make great content, and they're not getting a dime
from the platform or from the viewers. A million followers

94
00:10:55.040 --> 00:11:04.320
is not the same as $1,000,000. Please do not forget that.
Now, it might have sounded like I was a little upset about

95
00:11:04.320 --> 00:11:10.060
the fact that social networks don't pay creators to make
content, but that is not at all the case. My point was that

96
00:11:10.060 --> 00:11:16.900
YouTube is the only platform on which you can literally be
paid to do nothing but create awesome videos that people

97
00:11:16.900 --> 00:11:23.180
want to watch. You can use social media to get paid even if
you don't make YouTube videos but then your content

98
00:11:23.180 --> 00:11:29.090
production would require a different strategy and approach.
Now, I don't want to lose you guys by going into too much

99
00:11:29.090 --> 00:11:34.560
detail here, but it really is interesting to talk about this
stuff from the perspective of both a creator and a business

100
00:11:34.560 --> 00:11:40.120
person so if you do want to talk about it, join the Discord
server and shoot me a message. But anyway, all of that

101
00:11:40.120 --> 00:11:46.680
brings me back to my next point, which is that businesses
are built on the back of YouTube all the time. Real

102
00:11:46.680 --> 00:11:50.480
businesses. Like legit.

103
00:11:51.870 --> 00:11:58.010
Businesses, money generating like, you know what I'm saying,
a real business off of YouTube videos like take MrBeast, for

104
00:11:58.010 --> 00:12:06.960
example, a kid from...I think North Carolina who just was
making stupid videos in his room one day. And just

105
00:12:06.960 --> 00:12:12.630
through...of course, it's a whole long story, he did a lot,
experimented a lot, reinvested all of his money, but all off

106
00:12:12.660 --> 00:12:18.990
of making YouTube videos that he was eventually paid to make
and then taking that money to reinvest and make better

107
00:12:18.990 --> 00:12:24.720
videos so that he can make more money off of his great
videos and take that money and start a business. And now

108
00:12:24.720 --> 00:12:29.580
because he has brand recognition over here, people are
naturally going to go check out the business and support the

109
00:12:29.580 --> 00:12:34.310
business, especially when they see that he doesn't care
about money. He just wants more money to make better videos

110
00:12:34.310 --> 00:12:39.610
to help more people. Shit, how could I not support? So now
they're watching more videos. Literally watching MrBeast's

111
00:12:39.610 --> 00:12:46.110
videos is literally helping people in Africa get water or
people in North Carolina get food for the next two weeks.

112
00:12:46.110 --> 00:12:52.250
Like literally! I highly recommend you check out MrBeast,
understand his story and how he became the biggest YouTuber

113
00:12:52.250 --> 00:13:00.920
on the planet. It's...it's...it's insane, bro. It's insane.
I'm pretty sure I'm gonna do an episode on how similar

114
00:13:01.250 --> 00:13:06.290
MrBeast and Jeff Bezos are. I don't see how you could not
make that comparison, but we'll save that for another

115
00:13:06.290 --> 00:13:14.230
episode. But the point is, he was just a normal guy, just
started making videos at his house. That's it. And just by

116
00:13:14.230 --> 00:13:20.580
reinvesting everything he got out of the videos back into
the videos, got bigger and bigger and bigger...and the

117
00:13:20.580 --> 00:13:27.280
bigger you get in this game, the higher your earning
potential is, you know what I'm saying? So you could

118
00:13:27.280 --> 00:13:34.000
literally do nothing but make videos and start your own
personal fitness business...coffee shop. You want to be a

119
00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:40.170
lawyer? You can use social media to build your fucking
business, literally making videos for free. It doesn't

120
00:13:40.170 --> 00:13:47.460
matter what it is. You want to be a dog trainer or a dog
breeder or a painter or an au pair or a fucking lawn care

121
00:13:47.460 --> 00:13:56.210
specialist. It doesn't...like bruh, it doesn't matter! You
can build a business, offer videos on YouTube or TikTok or

122
00:13:56.270 --> 00:14:01.370
Instagram or whatever, whatever platform you choose. I'm
just saying YouTube offers all those other benefits -

123
00:14:01.370 --> 00:14:10.110
longevity, searchability, and those things, right? But the
point is the same - what used to be just stupid kids making

124
00:14:10.110 --> 00:14:16.040
dumbass videos on the internet is now how people literally
quit their jobs and wake up and do what they want to do

125
00:14:16.040 --> 00:14:19.600
every day on YouTube. The account is free.

126
00:14:21.090 --> 00:14:27.610
You can make an account right now. And go start your fucking
channel! There's nothing stopping you. If you're listening

127
00:14:27.610 --> 00:14:36.060
to this right now, you've got Wi-Fi, a smart device, all you
need is a fucking idea. Now, ideas are cheap. Execution is

128
00:14:36.060 --> 00:14:43.320
everything. I'm not trying to oversimplify it or nothing
like that, but it really does boil down to that. Alright?

129
00:14:43.720 --> 00:14:49.410
Which takes me to my next point - I don't want to lose track
of my notes here. The next reason that YouTube is the future

130
00:14:49.410 --> 00:14:55.470
is that anyone with the Internet and a smart device can make
content, like I just said - the barrier to entry is lower

131
00:14:55.470 --> 00:15:02.540
than it has ever been in human history. For all the
pessimists out there, I'm not talking shit. I used to be a

132
00:15:02.540 --> 00:15:08.360
pessimist myself, but for the pessimist specifically, you
might sit there and complain about how you need a lot of

133
00:15:08.360 --> 00:15:13.000
money or a lot of following, or a lot of this or a lot of
that to get started. There's all these reasons that you

134
00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:20.860
can't get started, all these reasons that you can't do
something. It's bullshit, bruh! It's bullshit. You don't

135
00:15:20.860 --> 00:15:26.090
have to wait for anyone. You don't need anyone's permission
to get started. You don't have to follow someone else's

136
00:15:26.090 --> 00:15:35.380
framework or try to walk down their path. You can create
your own legacy. You can pave your own path. You can set up

137
00:15:35.380 --> 00:15:45.180
your phone, press record, and send your message out into the
world...for free! And it doesn't even

138
00:15:45.180 --> 00:15:51.180
matter what your preferred style of communication is. If
you're good on camera, start a YouTube channel; if you're a

139
00:15:51.180 --> 00:15:56.830
great speaker but hate being on camera, start a podcast; if
you're an amazing writer, start a blog or publish an e-book.

140
00:15:58.350 --> 00:16:05.460
All the bullshit excuses, bro - lack of equipment, lack of
following, lack of ability, they're out the window! Every

141
00:16:05.460 --> 00:16:11.560
single person listening to this right now has a smartphone
or a computer. Every single creator on YouTube or any other

142
00:16:11.560 --> 00:16:17.570
platforms, for that matter, started with zero followers.
Every single person who owns a smartphone or computer and

143
00:16:17.570 --> 00:16:23.520
learn how to use that smartphone or computer and the social
networks that run on those devices is capable of learning

144
00:16:23.520 --> 00:16:31.120
how to make content. Stop for a second and just realize that
all of your favorite YouTubers are just regular people, like

145
00:16:31.120 --> 00:16:40.080
you and me. Stop and realize that people making videos about
cake, and sports, science, and dog breeding, are getting

146
00:16:40.080 --> 00:16:46.780
paid more than people with master's degrees. Stop and
realize that none of those people were rich celebrities when

147
00:16:46.780 --> 00:16:53.270
they started. Stop and think about all the people who won't
start a YouTube channel or a podcast because they've naively

148
00:16:53.270 --> 00:16:59.540
bought into the idea that their value is based on their
follower count. Or that they're supposed to blow up

149
00:16:59.540 --> 00:17:05.680
overnight without putting any hard work into the process.
Like, imagine how much more content would be out there if

150
00:17:05.680 --> 00:17:11.990
people weren't afraid to create. Just something to think
about.

151
00:17:12.400 --> 00:17:21.500
Let me move on to the next reason that YouTube is the
future. You decide what you watch, when you watch it, and

152
00:17:21.500 --> 00:17:28.690
where you watch it. Before YouTube, you had to watch
whatever was on the TV at the time. And who decided what was

153
00:17:28.690 --> 00:17:35.610
on TV at a particular time? The TV networks, of course. If
you wanted to see a particular show, you had to be in front

154
00:17:35.610 --> 00:17:42.240
of a TV at a particular time. And if you missed it, then you
missed it. Unless you have money and maybe you got it on

155
00:17:42.240 --> 00:17:49.560
DVR. Right? You could used to be able to record live TV and
then watch it later. Or maybe you catch a rerun at some

156
00:17:49.560 --> 00:17:55.030
point, right? And if you want to watch Rick and Morty, but
the network wants to show Bob's Burgers, you're either

157
00:17:55.030 --> 00:18:02.320
watching Bob's Burgers or nothing at all, those were your
choices. And that's why Netflix wins. Your movies and shows

158
00:18:02.320 --> 00:18:09.240
when you want and where you want with no annoying ads or
interruptions for just $7 a month. And that's why YouTube

159
00:18:09.240 --> 00:18:18.560
wins. Videos you want to see, when you want, and where you
want for free, with the occasional annoying ad.

160
00:18:18.960 --> 00:18:24.930
But guess what? You can pay not to see those ads, too, if
you really want. It doesn't matter if you're laying naked in

161
00:18:24.930 --> 00:18:32.670
bed, commuting to work on the train, working out at the gym,
walking in the park, or cooking dinner. You can get access

162
00:18:32.670 --> 00:18:40.700
to your favorite videos and podcasts whenever and wherever
you want. Now, another reason that YouTube is the future is

163
00:18:40.700 --> 00:18:48.160
because it learns about your viewing habits and recommends
more videos. Every time you search for or click on

164
00:18:48.160 --> 00:18:55.090
something, YouTube learns a little more about you and your
interest. YouTube then uses that data to guess which videos

165
00:18:55.090 --> 00:19:01.240
you would like to see in the future. It's always trying to
find ways to get you to spend more time watching videos. So

166
00:19:01.240 --> 00:19:07.490
it's always trying to learn about what you find interesting.
This means that even if you're too lazy to search for

167
00:19:07.490 --> 00:19:14.260
something new, YouTube will always recommend something new.
From which videos you click on to the amount of time you

168
00:19:14.260 --> 00:19:20.370
spend watching a video, to what you do after you watch the
video. YouTube is collecting data in order to create a

169
00:19:20.370 --> 00:19:29.220
better user experience on their platform. And also so they
can show you more relevant ads, right? Now,

170
00:19:30.440 --> 00:19:36.300
another cool thing, another reason that YouTube is the
future, another differentiator is that you can have multiple

171
00:19:36.300 --> 00:19:43.160
YouTube channels. If you've got enough passion about
different disciplines, if you know how to build teams, and

172
00:19:43.160 --> 00:19:48.260
make great content, you could create multiple streams of
revenue in the form of multiple channels with videos that

173
00:19:48.260 --> 00:19:56.330
can be found in search results and recommend it to people
for years to come. All of that translates into passive

174
00:19:56.330 --> 00:20:05.050
income for years to come. And those, my friends, are ten
reasons why YouTube is the future.

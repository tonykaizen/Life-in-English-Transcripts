00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:03.530
What's up, my friend? This is coffee with Kaizen number 27.

2
00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:05.120
And if you're listening to this episode,

3
00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:09.090
That means you've become a VIP member of the Life in English community.

4
00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:12.170
So first of all, I want to thank you for joining the community because,

5
00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:17.230
Without you, this podcast would not be possible. So I greatly appreciate your support.

6
00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:20.010
But now let me tell you about today's episode.

7
00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:25.930
We're going to take a trip across the pond to the U.K and listen to a short audio clip about mental health.

8
00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:29.550
Now, as always, I'm going to play the clip, then explain what was said,

9
00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:31.650
And leave you with something to think about.

10
00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:35.930
All right, so let's not waste any more time, and let's get started.

11
00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:37.150
I'm going to play the clip now.

12
00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:44.270
Sometimes we get to the train station, which is your brain,

13
00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:49.150
And a thought or a train comes through and you jump on it and you don't care where it's going.

14
00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:52.680
Take it all the way. You don't get off. You got all the way to Aberystwyth,

15
00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.090
And you sit in Aberystwyth and went, "I wanted to go to Edinburgh".

16
00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:57.800
You can't stop the train's coming. The thoughts are going to come.

17
00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:00.610
You know, "Am I going to cope with my exams? How am I going to be able to... (inaudible)?

18
00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:02.810
They're all come, but you don't have to jump on them each time.

19
00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:07.760
Thoughts are really powerful, but they're only as powerful as we let them be.

20
00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:16.640
All right, y'all, don't feel bad or concerned if you could not understand everything this man was saying.

21
00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:20.310
You know, it's an accent that's very different from mine, right?

22
00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.960
He's from somewhere in the UK, I'm not sure exactly where.

23
00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:28.400
And he was speaking quite fast. He wasn't enunciating as much as I do, for example.

24
00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:32.710
So don't feel bad if it was difficult to understand, especially,

25
00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:35.520
You know, just hearing it for the first time and all that type of stuff.

26
00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:41.540
So what I'm going to do now is just explain some of the words and phrases that he used during that clip,

27
00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:46.630
That I think maybe could be confusing or hard to understand if you're hearing them for the first time.

28
00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:52.240
And I'll try to play some pieces of the clip again so you can hear those words and expressions again.

29
00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:54.120
Then I'll play the whole clip one more time.

30
00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:57.000
Then I'll leave you with something to think about and we'll get out of here.

31
00:01:57.190 --> 00:01:59.440
So let's start with the explanations.

32
00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:03.330
The first thing I wanted to explain was "to get to the train station".

33
00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:11.550
And the point I want to talk about is "get to", to get to the train station is just another way of saying arrive at the train station.

34
00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:18.240
Here in the U.S, I think it's more common, maybe more natural to say "get to the train station". Right?

35
00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:22.250
I just got to the airport. Or what time are we going to get to the train station?

36
00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:26.900
What time are you going to get home? In that context what we're saying is arrive. All right?

37
00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:30.990
So the next thing I wanted to explain was "comes through" because he said,

38
00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:34.660
"a train comes through and you just jump on it".

39
00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:42.670
So in this case, to come through, the best way I can explain this is "to pass internally from one side to the other".

40
00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:47.290
And in this case, it would be the train station. So the train enters the station on one side,

41
00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:51.450
And it passes all the way to the other side of the train station and leaves.

42
00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:56.140
So it goes through or passes through or comes through that station. All right?

43
00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:59.800
It would be much easier, I think, to show you visually, but hopefully,

44
00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:03.140
Just me explaining it verbally you could get the idea. All right?

45
00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:08.690
So the next phrase is "jump on it" because the train comes through and you just jump on it.

46
00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:12.950
Now "to jump on" is an expression that means to get on it. All right?

47
00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:16.300
And this is a completely different way of using the word 'get' because at first,

48
00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:20.720
I said "get to the train station", which means arrive at the train station.

49
00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:27.100
But in this case, to get on the train means to board the train, right? To enter the train.

50
00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:33.410
So, when I say "just jump on the train", it's an informal way of saying to get on the train,

51
00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:36.880
And it's often used when we're speaking about public transportation.

52
00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:40.270
Like, I wouldn't say "jump on the car". You see what I'm saying?

53
00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:44.270
I could jump on a motorcycle. I could jump on the train. I could jump on a plane.

54
00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:47.120
I could jump on the bus, jump on a boat, or something like that.

55
00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:52.560
And it just, it's an informal way of saying to get on this mode of transportation. Okay?

56
00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:56.420
Now, the next thing I wanted to explain is "take it all the way",

57
00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:59.460
Because you just jump on the train and you take it all the way.

58
00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:03.630
Which just means to stay on it until the end of the trip or the end of the journey.

59
00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:13.920
So, if this train goes from Los Angeles to San Francisco, I can take the train all the way to San Francisco. Right?

60
00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:17.860
I can take it from the very beginning of its, let's say, its journey or whatever,

61
00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:21.020
To the completion all the way to the end.

62
00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:25.700
It's kind of hard to explain why we say "all the way", but we're just saying the whole way,

63
00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:29.260
The whole trip, the whole distance, the whole journey.

64
00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:32.280
We're not going to stop somewhere in the middle. We're not going to get off early.

65
00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:37.220
We're taking it all the way to the end. I hope that makes sense.

66
00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:41.120
So the next thing I wanted to explain is "you don't get off". Right?

67
00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:47.660
Because we talked about jumping on the train and the opposite would be hop off or jump off or get off.

68
00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:54.970
So, get on the train and get off the train. To board and unboard. Is it unboard or debord?!

69
00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:58.640
But I think it's unboard. Yeah, it's unboarding. Right?

70
00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:01.160
To unboard the plane means to get off the plane.

71
00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:05.200
Anyway, I don't want to confuse you. Let's get back to these explanations.

72
00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:09.280
So, The next one is "you don't get off". No, that's not next.

73
00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:16.910
I just explain that one. The next one is "and went". So let me go back to the actual line where he said that.

74
00:05:19.670 --> 00:05:23.230
One second. All right, here we go.

75
00:05:23.230 --> 00:05:27.260
I'm going to play it so we can be on the same page and you can know exactly what I'm talking about.

76
00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:28.100
Here we go.

77
00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:33.310
You got all the way to Aberystwyth, and you sit in Aberystwyth and went, "I wanted to go to Edinburgh."

78
00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:40.660
I don't know if you caught it, but he said "you go all the way to Aberystwyth".

79
00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:42.540
I can't pronounce the name of that city.

80
00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:48.030
So you go all the way to this place and then you sit in this place and went, "I wanted to go to Edinburgh".

81
00:05:49.450 --> 00:05:54.050
So this is kind of difficult to explain because the words that we're focusing on is "and went".

82
00:05:54.320 --> 00:06:01.350
So you go all the way to this place, you sit in this place and then you say or and then you go.

83
00:06:01.350 --> 00:06:04.530
I'm trying to think of a good way to explain this, because he's saying,

84
00:06:04.570 --> 00:06:06.930
"and went, I wanted to go to Edinburgh".

85
00:06:08.170 --> 00:06:11.810
So let me, let me give you a different example to try to show you what I mean.

86
00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:17.980
So you know how when we're telling a story and we're talking about something that someone else said,

87
00:06:18.570 --> 00:06:25.500
Normally what we would say is he said, blah blah blah or and then she said, blah blah blah.

88
00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:28.650
Or you said, blah blah blah. You see what I'm saying?

89
00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:35.470
That's how we express what somebody else has said, or that's how we quote people when telling stories, right?

90
00:06:35.710 --> 00:06:39.960
So you go all the way to this place and you sit in this place and then you say,

91
00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:41.930
"I wanted to go to Edinburgh".

92
00:06:42.140 --> 00:06:44.990
That's really the idea he's trying to express. He just didn't say it that way.

93
00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:49.690
You go all the way to this place and then you sit in this place and then you go,

94
00:06:50.460 --> 00:06:51.510
"I wanted to go to Edinburgh".

95
00:06:51.950 --> 00:06:55.750
So there's a couple of different ways of quoting people when telling a story.

96
00:06:56.410 --> 00:07:03.560
The most common, I think, is and then you say or said, and then he says or said, and then she said or said.

97
00:07:03.870 --> 00:07:09.080
But a very informal but also very common way to do the same thing is to say,

98
00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:15.290
And then you go or and then you went, depending on if you're referring to the present or the past.

99
00:07:15.470 --> 00:07:16.730
So let me use the same examples.

100
00:07:17.220 --> 00:07:21.110
So you go all the way to this place and then you sit in this place and you go,

101
00:07:21.850 --> 00:07:22.850
"I wanted to go to Edinburgh",

102
00:07:23.870 --> 00:07:24.770
Which is a different city.

103
00:07:25.640 --> 00:07:29.270
Or you go all the way to this place and you sit in this place and then you went,

104
00:07:30.150 --> 00:07:31.060
"I wanted to go to Edinburgh".

105
00:07:31.470 --> 00:07:35.300
Now, I'm not sure if this explanation is making sense, but you have three options.

106
00:07:36.130 --> 00:07:38.810
So you go to this place, you sit in this place and then you say,

107
00:07:39.910 --> 00:07:41.220
"I wanted to go to a different place".

108
00:07:41.960 --> 00:07:42.680
It's option number one.

109
00:07:43.080 --> 00:07:47.050
Number two, you go all the way to this place and you sit in this place and then you go,

110
00:07:48.080 --> 00:07:49.370
"I wanted to go to a different place".

111
00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:55.500
So the option number two, when I say "then you go". It's a very informal way of saying "then you say".

112
00:07:56.990 --> 00:08:01.160
I don't know why we say that, but if somebody is telling a story and they're quoting somebody else,

113
00:08:01.700 --> 00:08:08.390
If they're referring to what somebody else said or is saying they'll use the verb 'go' instead of 'say'.

114
00:08:10.720 --> 00:08:16.670
Another way now that I think about it, another way to express the same thing that you will hear a lot is using the word like.

115
00:08:17.150 --> 00:08:20.720
For example, she went all the way to the store and was like,

116
00:08:21.880 --> 00:08:23.250
"I wanted to go to a different store".

117
00:08:24.210 --> 00:08:28.820
So when I use those words "was like", really what I'm saying is, "she said".

118
00:08:30.150 --> 00:08:32.600
And if you pay attention to people having conversations,

119
00:08:32.600 --> 00:08:34.910
Telling stories to each other, you're going to notice this.

120
00:08:35.140 --> 00:08:36.730
So I'm talking to my friend and I'll say,

121
00:08:37.390 --> 00:08:39.840
"Man, she was like, get out of my face"

122
00:08:39.840 --> 00:08:41.700
And I was like, "I'm not going anywhere".

123
00:08:41.760 --> 00:08:43.840
And she was like, "I'm going to call the cops".

124
00:08:43.840 --> 00:08:45.550
And I was like, "Go ahead and call them".

125
00:08:45.980 --> 00:08:48.890
See what I'm saying? So what I'm saying, I was like, or she was like,

126
00:08:49.040 --> 00:08:52.210
Really what I'm saying is I said, or she said.

127
00:08:53.220 --> 00:08:58.130
I really hope I'm not confusing you because now we've gotten pretty far from the actual episode.

128
00:08:58.130 --> 00:09:01.830
But it's something important that, you know, it just came to my mind just now,

129
00:09:01.830 --> 00:09:04.950
It's something that we do and say all the time, you know.

130
00:09:05.860 --> 00:09:11.200
So I think I'm going to make another episode kind of just explaining that in more detail,

131
00:09:11.830 --> 00:09:14.490
Just so I can stay on topic and on track in this episode.

132
00:09:14.550 --> 00:09:19.530
But if you're listening to this right now, send me a message on the Discord chat or something like that.

133
00:09:19.530 --> 00:09:22.200
Let me know if this explanation is making any sense.

134
00:09:22.690 --> 00:09:25.380
Because I feel like I just took five minutes trying to explain it.

135
00:09:26.470 --> 00:09:28.670
And I don't even know if it made sense. So let's get back on track.

136
00:09:29.550 --> 00:09:31.370
So we just talked about "and went".

137
00:09:31.720 --> 00:09:38.910
The next phrase that I wanted to explain was "cope with", C O P E W I T H.

138
00:09:39.010 --> 00:09:45.520
To cope with something just means to overcome something. I mean, emotionally or,

139
00:09:45.770 --> 00:09:48.590
You know, psychologically to overcome something.

140
00:09:48.880 --> 00:09:52.750
So you might be coping with the loss of your grandmother,

141
00:09:52.750 --> 00:09:57.400
You might be coping with the fact that you failed your entrance exam or something like that.

142
00:09:57.630 --> 00:10:01.550
These are very emotionally difficult things to deal with, right?

143
00:10:01.550 --> 00:10:07.710
So to cope with them means to overcome those emotional difficulties and move forward. That's basically the idea.

144
00:10:08.450 --> 00:10:11.830
Now, the last phrase I wanted to explain was "as powerful as" because he said,

145
00:10:12.090 --> 00:10:15.260
"thoughts are only as powerful as we let them be".

146
00:10:15.740 --> 00:10:20.850
So in a case where you see the word as and then an adjective and then the word as again,

147
00:10:21.290 --> 00:10:25.190
As powerful as or as strong as, as intelligent as.

148
00:10:25.190 --> 00:10:28.330
You see what I'm saying? This is a way of comparing two things,

149
00:10:28.330 --> 00:10:31.650
and what we're saying is, you know, equal to.

150
00:10:31.760 --> 00:10:36.290
So, for example, thoughts are as powerful as we let them be.

151
00:10:37.240 --> 00:10:40.420
So when I say thoughts are only as powerful as we let them be,

152
00:10:40.790 --> 00:10:44.490
I'm saying thoughts only have the amount of power that we give them.

153
00:10:44.490 --> 00:10:51.860
You see what I'm saying? Thoughts have no more power than the amount of power that we give them.

154
00:10:53.090 --> 00:10:57.680
So the amount of power that thoughts have is equal to the amount of power that we give them,

155
00:10:57.680 --> 00:11:01.650
Because thoughts are only as powerful as we let them be.

156
00:11:01.920 --> 00:11:06.590
So you can see we're comparing the power that thoughts have to the power that we give them.

157
00:11:06.590 --> 00:11:12.730
And we do that by saying they're only as powerful as the power that we give them,

158
00:11:13.010 --> 00:11:20.510
Or only as powerful as we let them be, no more. Okay? No more powerful than that. Hopefully, that makes sense.

159
00:11:20.930 --> 00:11:26.170
And I definitely plan on focusing on it and explaining these type of phrases,

160
00:11:26.710 --> 00:11:31.990
You know, that go in the middle of sentences and express or form more complex sentences, you know.

161
00:11:32.400 --> 00:11:39.210
And express more specific detailed ideas. I'm trying to find a good way to do that. All right.

162
00:11:39.210 --> 00:11:43.450
But anyway, anyway, this episode has fallen off the rails.

163
00:11:43.500 --> 00:11:48.440
It was only like eight or nine explanations, but it took like eight or nine minutes, bro. Shit is crazy.

164
00:11:48.860 --> 00:11:54.400
So let me play the clip one more time and then just give you something to think about and we'll get out of here.

165
00:11:54.770 --> 00:12:01.230
All right. Let's do it.

166
00:12:01.230 --> 00:12:04.470
Sometimes we get to the train station, which is your brain,

167
00:12:05.410 --> 00:12:09.350
And a thought or a train comes through and you jump on it and you don't care where it's going.

168
00:12:09.660 --> 00:12:12.880
Take it all the way. You don't get off. You got all the way to Aberystwyth,

169
00:12:12.880 --> 00:12:15.290
And you sit in Aberystwyth and went, "I wanted to go to Edinburgh".

170
00:12:15.870 --> 00:12:18.000
You can't stop the train's coming. The thoughts are going to come.

171
00:12:18.330 --> 00:12:20.880
You know, "Am I going to cope with my exams? How am I going to be able to... (inaudible)?

172
00:12:21.070 --> 00:12:23.010
They're all come, but you don't have to jump on them each time.

173
00:12:23.190 --> 00:12:27.930
Thoughts are really powerful, but they're only as powerful as we let them be.

174
00:12:32.620 --> 00:12:35.850
All right! Now, I'm sure I'm not the only one who can relate to this.

175
00:12:36.700 --> 00:12:41.380
I don't know if it's because I'm a relatively creative person or if it's anxiety-related,

176
00:12:41.450 --> 00:12:43.580
Or if it's something completely different all together.

177
00:12:43.900 --> 00:12:46.790
But there are times when it feels like I'm having a thousand thoughts a minute.

178
00:12:48.130 --> 00:12:51.310
Thought after thought, after thought. And to make things worse,

179
00:12:51.540 --> 00:12:54.590
I entertain each and every one of those thoughts that pops into my head.

180
00:12:56.130 --> 00:12:59.980
This random idea pops into my head, it catches my attention and then I pursue it.

181
00:13:00.740 --> 00:13:04.860
Before I know it, I'm out in the middle of nowhere with this useless thought that I decided to pursue.

182
00:13:05.790 --> 00:13:09.760
I'm so far away from where I started that I can't even remember what I was thinking about

183
00:13:09.760 --> 00:13:12.490
Or doing before I started chasing this random thought.

184
00:13:13.410 --> 00:13:16.050
And then another thought pops into my head and I'm going again.

185
00:13:17.790 --> 00:13:20.880
Now, overthinking could be considered something like a sickness, don't you think?

186
00:13:22.200 --> 00:13:27.140
I mean, sickness in the sense that it never feels good mentally or physically to overthink,

187
00:13:27.920 --> 00:13:30.340
At least to me, it's not a pleasant experience.

188
00:13:31.450 --> 00:13:34.350
It's not something I wish would happen more. You know what I'm saying?

189
00:13:35.110 --> 00:13:38.440
It's something that only causes exhaustion, anxiety, and frustration.

190
00:13:39.320 --> 00:13:43.570
I think that's why many meditation practitioners speak about the act of calming your mind down

191
00:13:43.570 --> 00:13:46.220
And reducing the number of thoughts and ideas you entertain.

192
00:13:46.980 --> 00:13:51.930
When your mind is the one that's in control, it will put you in a car and take you wherever it wants to go

193
00:13:52.310 --> 00:13:54.130
And you're paying for the gas. You feel me?

194
00:13:55.580 --> 00:13:59.400
What I mean is that you're the one that's spending the mental and sometimes physical energy

195
00:14:00.090 --> 00:14:02.080
To entertain and focus on these thoughts.

196
00:14:03.580 --> 00:14:06.450
Now, a few months ago, a friend of mine told me something that I'll probably never forget.

197
00:14:07.640 --> 00:14:13.970
He said, "you spend the same amount of energy thinking about something as you spend actually doing something".

198
00:14:15.970 --> 00:14:19.390
In other words, you spend the same amount of energy imagining a disaster

199
00:14:20.010 --> 00:14:22.520
As you spend actually experiencing the disaster.

200
00:14:24.560 --> 00:14:28.070
And it's so true, man. Your body can be in perfect condition,

201
00:14:28.070 --> 00:14:34.370
And at the same time, your mind can be completely exhausted. Thinking requires like, Real energy.

202
00:14:35.240 --> 00:14:38.410
And as humans, we have a finite amount of energy to work with each day.

203
00:14:39.980 --> 00:14:43.570
I've noticed in my own life that making a conscious effort to stop entertaining thoughts

204
00:14:43.570 --> 00:14:46.950
That don't serve me at the moment was one of the best decisions I've ever made.

205
00:14:46.950 --> 00:14:54.270
I used to overthink and analyze all kinds of things that had nothing to do with whatever I was doing in the present moment.

206
00:14:54.840 --> 00:14:59.520
Not even knowing that I was robbing myself of peace, focus, and precious mental energy.

207
00:15:01.040 --> 00:15:04.170
I've talked quite a bit about self-awareness in previous episodes,

208
00:15:04.170 --> 00:15:08.200
And I'd like to speak about it again because it really is the key to so many things in life.

209
00:15:09.270 --> 00:15:13.910
In this case, self-awareness is the key to overcoming the annoying habit of overthinking.

210
00:15:14.940 --> 00:15:17.570
It's the key to gaining control of your mind and realizing that

211
00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:22.020
The one and only person that can entertain the thoughts that pass through your mind is you.

212
00:15:23.660 --> 00:15:26.940
Now, as my man said in the clip, you can't stop the thoughts from coming,

213
00:15:27.670 --> 00:15:29.410
But you can always choose how you react to them.

214
00:15:30.520 --> 00:15:32.960
You can always choose whether or not to give it your attention.

215
00:15:32.960 --> 00:15:40.350
And life really becomes much more simple and enjoyable when you limit the amount of things that get your attention.

216
00:15:42.110 --> 00:15:43.810
I wouldn't consider myself a minimalist,

217
00:15:43.870 --> 00:15:49.840
But I would say that the minimalist approach is very effective in many aspects of our lives.

218
00:15:51.310 --> 00:15:53.180
Less is often more.

219
00:15:54.930 --> 00:15:58.900
So if you can just reach a level of self-awareness that allows you to stop and say,

220
00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:01.820
"that thought doesn't need my attention right now",

221
00:16:02.860 --> 00:16:04.770
Or "that's bullshit"

222
00:16:05.440 --> 00:16:07.310
Or even better, say nothing at all.

223
00:16:08.710 --> 00:16:11.670
Then I think you'll experience a different level of internal peace.

224
00:16:12.260 --> 00:16:15.460
Now this, of course, takes a lot of time and discipline to achieve.

225
00:16:15.460 --> 00:16:20.300
You have to be incredibly self-aware and have a good amount of self-knowledge as well.

226
00:16:21.500 --> 00:16:26.510
It's hard to recognize which thoughts are useless or bad habits or relevant or important,

227
00:16:27.030 --> 00:16:30.830
If you haven't been paying attention to yourself and learning about yourself up until this point.

228
00:16:31.590 --> 00:16:34.890
So it's definitely a difficult process, but it's definitely worth it.

229
00:16:35.760 --> 00:16:39.510
So just remember, the thoughts are going to come, there's no stopping them.

230
00:16:40.510 --> 00:16:44.810
But you always have control over how you react, not just to your thoughts,

231
00:16:44.810 --> 00:16:48.220
But also your emotions, your urges, and your impulses.

232
00:16:49.550 --> 00:16:52.980
So I sincerely hope this gave you something to think about, I hope you enjoyed the episode.

233
00:16:52.980 --> 00:16:56.050
I hope you learned some things. But that's it for now, man.

234
00:16:56.050 --> 00:16:56.810
So I'm going to get out of here.

235
00:16:56.810 --> 00:16:59.980
This is Coffee with Kaizen number 27 in the books.

236
00:17:00.560 --> 00:17:02.700
And I will talk to you soon. Peace!

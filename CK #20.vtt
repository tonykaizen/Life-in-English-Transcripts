00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:03.260
Here are 8 tips to achieve anything you want in life.

2
00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:11.310
What's up my friend? This is Coffee with Kaizen number 20.

3
00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:16.020
And we've been doing a lot of English lessons lately, vocabulary, grammar and things like that.

4
00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:19.810
So I thought I'd switch it up today because this is still Life in English.

5
00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:21.660
So let's talk a little bit about life today.

6
00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:27.660
I was scrolling on TikTok yesterday or the day before, I can't remember. And I saw this interesting post,

7
00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:31.330
Which was titled "8 tips to achieve anything you want in life".

8
00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:33.950
So really, all I'm going to do is share those tips with you.

9
00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:38.800
See if I can find a way to link them not just to life, but your Life in English.

10
00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:42.830
And then we'll get out of here, you know, so this should be a short episode.

11
00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:47.380
But you know, sometimes that's difficult for me. So let's see how this goes.

12
00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:50.830
Now let's get right into these tips, man. We're not going to waste any time.

13
00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:55.990
Tip number 1. Focus on commitment, not motivation.

14
00:00:56.560 --> 00:01:00.860
Just how committed are you to your goal? How important is it for you?

15
00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:05.320
If you find yourself truly committed the motivation will follow.

16
00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:08.950
So that's what whoever wrote this post, that's what they're saying.

17
00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:14.740
I would change it a little bit and say, focus on commitment and not inspiration. You know?

18
00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:19.030
I talked before on this podcast about the difference between motivation and inspiration.

19
00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:22.550
And a lot of times when people think of motivation, they're really thinking of inspiration.

20
00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:26.690
Just that surge of positive energy that makes you feel like you can do anything.

21
00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:30.650
"Yeah, I'm going to study. I'm going to do this. I'm strong, I'm capable"

22
00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:32.260
And all these things. That's inspiration.

23
00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:35.300
The problem is that feeling comes and goes,

24
00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:40.010
Whereas motivation really is just the reason for doing something. Right?

25
00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:43.220
So I don't think that's something that comes and goes.

26
00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:45.320
If you have a reason for, let's say, learning English,

27
00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:50.750
I don't think that reason is going to disappear or come and go on a regular basis.

28
00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:54.200
The reason is the reason. And only you know what the real reason is.

29
00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:58.580
And only you know if that reason is strong enough or let's say,

30
00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:03.400
important enough for you to stay committed to your goal. You know?

31
00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:06.980
So I would say focus on commitment, not inspiration.

32
00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:13.440
Motivation is extremely important, but it's not what most people refer to it as.

33
00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:17.700
Motivation is simply the true reason that you're doing something, in my opinion.

34
00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:19.560
So it's just something to think about. You know?

35
00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:22.140
Because a lot of times we're going to have those days, man.

36
00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:29.940
Learning a language is like a long, difficult daily process, you know, talking over months or years sometimes, so...

37
00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:36.770
If you can't find it in yourself to stay committed to that goal, you're in trouble. You know?

38
00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:38.620
Because there's going to be days when you wake up and you're like,

39
00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:41.460
"Man, fuck this, I'm not studying, I'm not practicing.

40
00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:44.140
I don't want to talk to anybody. This shit is too difficult"

41
00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:49.010
"Let me just watch Netflix. Let me get on my phone. Do something easy, something simple".

42
00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:55.010
But those are the days, funny enough, those are the days that you need to stay committed the most.

43
00:02:55.480 --> 00:03:02.210
When you're feeling tempted to... how can I say? Neglect your responsibilities.

44
00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:04.430
Because in this case, it's a responsibility, you have a goal,

45
00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:07.700
Something you want to achieve, so it's your responsibility to make it happen. Right?

46
00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:11.960
So focus on commitment, not inspiration.

47
00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:16.790
Tip number 2. Seek knowledge, not results.

48
00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:22.690
If you focus on the excitement of discovery, improvement, exploration,

49
00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:26.390
And experimentation, your motivation will always be fueled.

50
00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:33.840
If you focus only on results, your motivation will be like the weather, it will die the minute you hit a storm.

51
00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:38.990
So the key is to focus on the journey and not the destination.

52
00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:43.390
Keep thinking about what you're learning along the way and what you can improve.

53
00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:45.130
This one is also important, right?

54
00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:50.520
Because a lot of us kind of get caught up or so focused on this idea of fluency

55
00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:53.150
Or reaching some advanced level, and that's all that matters.

56
00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:56.810
And we don't really pay too much attention to the process itself, you know?

57
00:03:57.270 --> 00:04:00.630
Going from zero to a hundred, going from zero to fluent.

58
00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:06.290
A lot of people get so lost in the dream that they don't focus on the present

59
00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:12.420
And what they're learning every day, the small wins or victories let's say, they're getting every single day. You know?

60
00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:17.000
They're not... I think another problem is a lot of people are so interested in the idea of fluency,

61
00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:25.130
But they're not at all interested in the idea of learning, you know, maybe I'm being redundant.

62
00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:31.950
But what I'm trying to say is a lot of people don't care about what influences the language that they're trying to learn.

63
00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:36.200
Like, a lot of people want to become fluent in English or some other language,

64
00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:43.560
And they think I just need to memorize 5000 words and how to use these 5000 words in a logical manner in a sentence.

65
00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:50.900
But they're not at all interested in culture, the history of the country or the language itself,

66
00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:53.220
The people that they're going to be communicating with.

67
00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:54.560
They're not interested in any of that.

68
00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:58.760
They just want the language itself and the language is nothing more than a tool.

69
00:04:59.450 --> 00:05:03.600
English, Spanish, Japanese, Swahili, it doesn't... they're just tools, you know?

70
00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:07.810
It's what we do with those tools, in my opinion, that's most interesting. Right?

71
00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:11.910
The knowledge, not the result. The process, not the destination.

72
00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:13.170
It's important to remember that.

73
00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:17.930
So, tip number 3. Make the journey fun.

74
00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:20.140
It's an awesome game.

75
00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:25.910
The minute you make it serious, there's a big chance it'll start creating a heavy emotional weight

76
00:05:26.410 --> 00:05:28.850
And you'll lose perspective and become stuck again.

77
00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:32.910
So it's very important to just have fun with the process.

78
00:05:32.910 --> 00:05:34.890
Don't take it too seriously. It's going to take time.

79
00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:38.190
You cannot rush these things. I don't care what anybody tells you.

80
00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:42.950
There's no thousand-dollar secret to get you there faster. It just doesn't exist.

81
00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:45.410
So you might as well find a way to have fun,

82
00:05:45.410 --> 00:05:49.970
Which is why it's so important to find people to talk to that you actually like. You know? I.

83
00:05:49.970 --> 00:05:53.970
Know that's easier said than done because it's kind of, you know,

84
00:05:54.030 --> 00:05:58.730
Depending on your personality and things like that, it can be really hard to find somebody, let's say,

85
00:05:58.730 --> 00:06:03.210
Cool or easygoing or somebody you identify with that you can talk to on a regular basis.

86
00:06:03.730 --> 00:06:09.780
But still gotta do it, man. I mean, otherwise, you're going to have a real difficult time.

87
00:06:10.150 --> 00:06:14.120
And the more difficult it is most of the time, the less fun it is. Right?

88
00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:16.560
So just remember to not take it too seriously, man.

89
00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:24.040
Because we all got to go through this process and none of us are going to get to the "finish line" in weeks or months. You know?

90
00:06:24.210 --> 00:06:27.150
We all got to go through the same process when learning this language.

91
00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:32.650
So, why not just look on the bright side, have some fun with it, you know? All right.

92
00:06:32.700 --> 00:06:37.540
Tip number four, I believe. Get rid of stagnating thoughts.

93
00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:42.400
Thoughts influence feelings and feelings determine how you view your work.

94
00:06:43.510 --> 00:06:48.130
You have a lot of thoughts in your head and you always have a choice of which ones to focus on.

95
00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:53.750
The ones that will make you emotionally stuck, like fear or doubt.

96
00:06:54.380 --> 00:06:58.550
Or the ones that will move you forward, like excitement, experimentation,

97
00:06:58.550 --> 00:07:02.000
Trying new things, stepping outside of your comfort zone. Right?

98
00:07:02.980 --> 00:07:07.680
So if you can, just make an effort to not focus on the negative shit like,

99
00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:09.590
"I'm stupid. This is too hard"

100
00:07:10.440 --> 00:07:12.650
"I'm not smart enough to talk to this person"

101
00:07:12.650 --> 00:07:15.150
"My English isn't good enough. I'm never going to get there".

102
00:07:15.490 --> 00:07:18.700
All that bullshit. Nhe nhe nhe nhe in your ear.

103
00:07:19.550 --> 00:07:22.490
Can't focus on it, man. You can't focus on it.

104
00:07:22.510 --> 00:07:25.200
You just got to focus on the positivity as cliche,

105
00:07:25.760 --> 00:07:28.940
As fucking cliche as that sounds. It's for real, man.

106
00:07:28.940 --> 00:07:30.340
You just got to focus on the positive.

107
00:07:30.340 --> 00:07:34.440
You have to make a conscious effort to acknowledge the progress that you're making,

108
00:07:34.930 --> 00:07:36.920
The effort that you're making, the things that you're learning.

109
00:07:37.230 --> 00:07:41.270
Even if it was just one fucking word, one expression you learned today.

110
00:07:41.590 --> 00:07:44.950
Or you just talked to one human being. You know?

111
00:07:45.420 --> 00:07:48.740
You were scared shitless, but you did it. You talked to the person. Got to acknowledge that.

112
00:07:49.690 --> 00:07:51.150
That's a victory, you know?

113
00:07:51.720 --> 00:07:56.820
And you're not going to get very far if you can't make an effort to acknowledge even the, let's say,

114
00:07:56.860 --> 00:07:59.560
Small victories that you make on a daily basis. A

115
00:07:59.640 --> 00:08:01.740
nd that's just in life, not just with English. Right?

116
00:08:01.740 --> 00:08:04.670
The title is "8 tips to achieve anything you want in life".

117
00:08:04.980 --> 00:08:07.830
I'm just trying to connect it to Life in English. You know?

118
00:08:08.750 --> 00:08:11.750
So, tip number what? Six? I lost count.

119
00:08:12.180 --> 00:08:15.600
Next tip, let's say. Use your imagination.

120
00:08:16.690 --> 00:08:20.080
The next step after getting rid of negative thoughts is to use your imagination.

121
00:08:21.070 --> 00:08:26.650
When things go well you're full of positive energy and when you're experimenting or experiencing difficulties,

122
00:08:27.110 --> 00:08:31.410
You need to be even more energetic. So rename your situation.

123
00:08:32.440 --> 00:08:35.440
If you keep saying,"I hate my work. I hate my work".

124
00:08:37.130 --> 00:08:42.060
Guess which feelings those words will evoke? It's a matter of imagination.

125
00:08:42.990 --> 00:08:46.770
You can always find something to learn, even from the worst boss in the world

126
00:08:46.870 --> 00:08:49.500
Or the most boring job or the most terrible situation.

127
00:08:50.410 --> 00:08:51.810
So here's an exercise for you.

128
00:08:52.850 --> 00:08:58.110
For just three days, think and say positive things only and see what happens.

129
00:08:59.530 --> 00:09:04.260
Now again, I know that sounds very cliche, but it's for real, man.

130
00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:08.150
And I'm not saying that just because I'm reading this here like, reading somebody else's post.

131
00:09:08.910 --> 00:09:13.310
That's, let's say, a recommendation that I would give to anybody is just focus on the positivity.

132
00:09:13.640 --> 00:09:16.850
Because I don't know how long you've been listening to this podcast,

133
00:09:17.220 --> 00:09:19.710
And I don't know how much I've talked about it before in the past.

134
00:09:20.120 --> 00:09:25.650
But historically, I'm a very negative person. You know what I mean?

135
00:09:25.650 --> 00:09:27.740
Like, very negative, skeptical.

136
00:09:30.400 --> 00:09:33.440
I can't think of any other words, so I'm going to keep it simple, just very negative.

137
00:09:33.570 --> 00:09:37.000
And of course, it's had a negative effect on my life experience,

138
00:09:37.160 --> 00:09:39.990
On the way I've seen things and done things and things like that.

139
00:09:40.360 --> 00:09:43.390
And when I just made that change to decide to focus on the good,

140
00:09:44.240 --> 00:09:46.730
The positive, the progress, and things like that.

141
00:09:47.070 --> 00:09:53.590
And stop judging myself for bad decisions I've made or judging myself for how difficult something is for me,

142
00:09:53.590 --> 00:09:56.360
Or how long it takes me to do it, or anything like that.

143
00:09:56.830 --> 00:10:00.560
Stop judging yourself and holding yourself to such a high, unrealistic standard

144
00:10:01.330 --> 00:10:05.330
And just focus on the positive, what's actually good, what's working.

145
00:10:05.860 --> 00:10:09.410
And put more energy and effort into that so you get stronger and better at those things.

146
00:10:09.600 --> 00:10:13.650
Because focusing on the negativity only generates more negativity.

147
00:10:14.070 --> 00:10:17.180
So, you know, stay positive.

148
00:10:18.220 --> 00:10:20.880
I know it's tough. But you got to do it. All right?

149
00:10:20.880 --> 00:10:24.390
Next tip. Stop being nice to yourself.

150
00:10:25.390 --> 00:10:31.320
I really like this one. It says motivation means action and action brings results.

151
00:10:31.950 --> 00:10:34.180
Sometimes your actions fail to bring the results you want.

152
00:10:34.770 --> 00:10:38.810
So you prefer to be nice to yourself and not put yourself in a difficult situation.

153
00:10:39.530 --> 00:10:44.560
You wait for the perfect timing for an opportunity while you drive yourself into stagnation

154
00:10:44.560 --> 00:10:46.300
And sometimes even into depression.

155
00:10:47.650 --> 00:10:53.320
So get out there, challenge yourself and do something that you want to do, even if you're afraid.

156
00:10:53.320 --> 00:10:55.870
This is probably my favorite tip out of all of them.

157
00:10:56.040 --> 00:10:57.870
Stop being so fucking nice to yourself.

158
00:10:59.060 --> 00:11:02.060
And it probably doesn't sound like the best motivational tip,

159
00:11:02.060 --> 00:11:04.270
But this isn't about motivation, I'm not here to motivate you.

160
00:11:04.770 --> 00:11:07.120
I've already explained, motivation comes from within.

161
00:11:07.860 --> 00:11:12.740
So I maybe could inspire you, but that's not even my objective here. You know?

162
00:11:13.070 --> 00:11:15.780
So I would say, stop being so fucking nice to yourself.

163
00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:17.630
Stop treating yourself like a baby and saying,

164
00:11:17.700 --> 00:11:19.250
"Oh, it's okay, tomorrow..."

165
00:11:19.540 --> 00:11:21.820
"Oh, it's okay. You don't have to step outside your comfort zone"

166
00:11:22.090 --> 00:11:22.950
"No, we're not ready"

167
00:11:22.950 --> 00:11:24.840
And all these things, trying to protect yourself.

168
00:11:25.100 --> 00:11:28.510
Because in that process of trying to protect yourself, you know,

169
00:11:28.510 --> 00:11:31.570
Like people like to call it, you're not doing anything but making yourself weaker.

170
00:11:32.970 --> 00:11:36.910
In life, in your language learning journey, whatever it is, by protecting yourself,

171
00:11:37.150 --> 00:11:41.680
Avoiding something that you know you should be doing just because it's difficult or it makes you uncomfortable

172
00:11:41.810 --> 00:11:50.690
Or you're afraid of it, all you're doing is reinforcing the idea you have in your mind that you are too weak to do something

173
00:11:50.690 --> 00:11:54.240
Or too afraid that you are not capable of doing something.

174
00:11:54.590 --> 00:11:59.570
And that's a terrible thing to do to yourself. You know? Terrible thing.

175
00:11:59.920 --> 00:12:04.560
So stop being so fucking nice to yourself and push yourself outside your comfort zone.

176
00:12:04.560 --> 00:12:05.740
Because nobody else is going to do it.

177
00:12:06.030 --> 00:12:10.120
So every day that you go by just treating yourself like a baby saying

178
00:12:10.120 --> 00:12:16.270
"It's okay. I'm not going to grow or learn or step outside my comfort zone or do difficult or scary things"

179
00:12:17.450 --> 00:12:19.550
You're just digging a deeper and deeper hole.

180
00:12:20.930 --> 00:12:23.420
And you won't be able to get out of it at some point. You know?

181
00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:27.650
So like I said, nobody's going to do it for you. You got to do it.

182
00:12:28.280 --> 00:12:30.400
Stop being so fucking nice to yourself. All right?

183
00:12:30.940 --> 00:12:34.460
It's okay to be mean to yourself as long as it's with good intentions. Right?

184
00:12:34.520 --> 00:12:36.710
I know that sounds contradictory and strange.

185
00:12:37.060 --> 00:12:42.330
But like, you got to, you know, you've got to give yourself a kick in the ass sometimes, man.

186
00:12:43.290 --> 00:12:45.450
I'm telling you. Hopefully, that makes sense. I don't know.

187
00:12:45.450 --> 00:12:47.400
I'm gonna talk about that more in the future.

188
00:12:47.500 --> 00:12:51.600
But we're already at 14, 15 minutes. So let's finish this up.

189
00:12:51.940 --> 00:12:55.040
Next tip. Get rid of distractions.

190
00:12:56.100 --> 00:12:58.800
Meaningless things and distractions will always be in your way,

191
00:12:59.510 --> 00:13:04.240
Especially those easy, usual things that you'd rather do instead of focusing on new,

192
00:13:04.770 --> 00:13:06.510
And challenging, and meaningful projects.

193
00:13:07.590 --> 00:13:09.340
Learn to focus on what is most important.

194
00:13:10.370 --> 00:13:15.090
Write a list of all the things that waste your time and hold yourself accountable not to do them.

195
00:13:16.080 --> 00:13:18.560
Now, this is another one of those things that sounds simple,

196
00:13:19.070 --> 00:13:21.980
But it's actually quite difficult to do in reality.

197
00:13:21.980 --> 00:13:25.060
Because if you have any level of self-awareness,

198
00:13:25.060 --> 00:13:28.790
You most likely know what you're doing to avoid your responsibilities.

199
00:13:29.170 --> 00:13:32.580
Like, you know what you're doing to just waste time. Right?

200
00:13:33.330 --> 00:13:36.120
And we could easily write a list of all those things and say,

201
00:13:36.120 --> 00:13:37.740
"Okay, I'm going to stop doing these things".

202
00:13:38.140 --> 00:13:43.710
But the actual part where you stop doing it for an extended period of time,

203
00:13:44.310 --> 00:13:46.460
That's the hard part, holding yourself accountable.

204
00:13:46.460 --> 00:13:49.280
Because again, nobody's really going to do it for you.

205
00:13:49.280 --> 00:13:52.400
And maybe you have a friend or something like that that will hold you accountable,

206
00:13:52.400 --> 00:13:55.700
But I think that's a rare thing indeed. You know?

207
00:13:56.590 --> 00:13:58.150
So, and even if you do have a friend like that,

208
00:13:58.480 --> 00:14:02.340
You should still be able to hold yourself accountable because you are with you.

209
00:14:03.100 --> 00:14:06.470
Nobody else is with you. It's just you, right?

210
00:14:06.810 --> 00:14:13.230
So it's very important, man, to like, have a clear idea of what you're doing to avoid your responsibilities,

211
00:14:13.230 --> 00:14:17.080
To waste time and things like that, and make a conscious effort to get rid of those distractions.

212
00:14:17.080 --> 00:14:23.740
Because at the end of the day, we all got 24 hours in a day. Never more, never less.

213
00:14:25.270 --> 00:14:29.430
And you may not think of it this way, but everything you're going to do today with your 24 hours

214
00:14:29.720 --> 00:14:35.860
Will directly affect how your life goes 6 months from now, in a year from now.

215
00:14:36.380 --> 00:14:39.160
Like literally. Literally, bro.

216
00:14:39.230 --> 00:14:42.490
The cheeseburger you're going to buy this afternoon is going to affect your life,

217
00:14:42.760 --> 00:14:45.860
Your health, your finances six weeks from now, literally.

218
00:14:47.580 --> 00:14:50.320
I could not be more serious about that.

219
00:14:50.320 --> 00:14:55.610
Because once you understand that, hopefully, your thought process and your decision-making process

220
00:14:55.640 --> 00:14:58.900
Will change for the better when you stop just thinking about today.

221
00:14:58.900 --> 00:15:02.410
Because there's no such thing as a small decision.

222
00:15:02.410 --> 00:15:10.070
We may think of simple decisions as small ones, but all decisions are the same size because they all have consequences. You know?

223
00:15:10.340 --> 00:15:13.110
So by choosing to get rid of distractions,

224
00:15:13.330 --> 00:15:20.550
I think you will notice how much more time you actually have every single day to do stuff that's really important.

225
00:15:21.680 --> 00:15:22.120
Like for real.

226
00:15:24.020 --> 00:15:29.520
I don't know if they have this on Android, but on like, iPhone and Apple computers, they have what's called "screen time",

227
00:15:29.520 --> 00:15:34.530
Which shows you how much time every day and every week you spend looking at your phone or your computer.

228
00:15:34.990 --> 00:15:36.770
And goddamn, man. I'm telling...

229
00:15:36.770 --> 00:15:42.060
If you haven't done it already, just take a quick look to see how much time you actually spend on your phone.

230
00:15:42.610 --> 00:15:47.790
Like, me personally, it could be anywhere from 3 to 5 hours a day on my phone.

231
00:15:48.150 --> 00:15:51.610
From 6 to 10 to 13 hours on my computer.

232
00:15:51.860 --> 00:15:54.660
Now, obviously, I work on my computer from home and things like that.

233
00:15:54.910 --> 00:15:59.040
But dude, like half the day, literally.

234
00:16:00.170 --> 00:16:05.750
I'm sleep for 4 or 5 or 6 of those hours. So then 10 to 13 I'm literally looking at a screen.

235
00:16:07.070 --> 00:16:11.080
Gotta eat, gotta shower. You know what I'm saying? Gotta do stuff like that.

236
00:16:11.080 --> 00:16:17.020
So it's like, man, you really got to be aware of where your time is going on a daily basis. Right?

237
00:16:18.280 --> 00:16:22.890
All right. Last tip, man. Last tip. Do not rely on other people.

238
00:16:23.560 --> 00:16:25.970
Or in other words, do not depend on other people.

239
00:16:26.880 --> 00:16:30.600
You should never expect others to do it for you, not even your partner,

240
00:16:31.020 --> 00:16:34.210
Your friend, your boss, your parents, nobody.

241
00:16:35.220 --> 00:16:37.580
They're all busy with their own needs and their own lives.

242
00:16:38.660 --> 00:16:44.340
And no one will make you happy or achieve your goals for you. It's all on you.

243
00:16:45.480 --> 00:16:49.770
So I could talk a lot about that in relation to life in general, but let's just stay focused on English.

244
00:16:50.270 --> 00:16:55.720
I said this many times before and that is nobody's going to learn English for you.

245
00:16:55.720 --> 00:16:58.980
You got to take responsibility for your language learning process.

246
00:16:59.280 --> 00:17:03.600
Like me as a teacher or somebody else as your language learning partner will help you get there,

247
00:17:03.980 --> 00:17:06.430
Hopefully faster, more effectively, and in a more fun way.

248
00:17:06.950 --> 00:17:09.050
But at the end of the day, you got to do it.

249
00:17:10.590 --> 00:17:13.390
I released a video recently, I think it was on Tik Tok or Instagram,

250
00:17:13.820 --> 00:17:18.720
Basically talking about 3 things I learned from teaching English online for the last 3 years.

251
00:17:19.240 --> 00:17:25.520
And one of those lessons was the best students take responsibility for their education. You know?

252
00:17:25.670 --> 00:17:29.570
Because a personal trainer can teach you how to lift weights properly, right?

253
00:17:29.570 --> 00:17:32.470
The right form and how many reps to do and things like that.

254
00:17:32.740 --> 00:17:36.480
But at the end of the day, you still have to lift the weights.

255
00:17:36.480 --> 00:17:38.000
The trainer is not going to lift the weights for you.

256
00:17:38.330 --> 00:17:41.390
Your mom's not going to do it. Your friend's not going to do it. You got to do it.

257
00:17:42.140 --> 00:17:46.550
So I can teach you all the information and lessons and words and culture and all that type of stuff.

258
00:17:46.640 --> 00:17:51.720
But if you don't do anything with it, that's on you. You know?

259
00:17:52.270 --> 00:17:53.980
So don't depend on others,

260
00:17:53.980 --> 00:17:58.580
Don't expect other people to achieve your goals for you or hold your hand

261
00:17:58.850 --> 00:18:02.020
And help you get there safely and quickly and easily.

262
00:18:02.850 --> 00:18:05.940
It's not how this works. And hopefully, you know that.

263
00:18:06.060 --> 00:18:10.110
I don't want you to think I'm speaking to you as if I'm speaking to a child or something like that.

264
00:18:10.110 --> 00:18:16.850
It's just really, a lot of people, man, they don't stop to consider these 8 tips. You know?

265
00:18:17.430 --> 00:18:21.250
They go through life just confused, frustrated, miserable, you know,

266
00:18:21.570 --> 00:18:23.240
Irritated that things aren't going their way.

267
00:18:23.760 --> 00:18:27.290
And they never kind of look inward or in the mirror and say,

268
00:18:27.290 --> 00:18:30.980
"What the fuck am I doing to create this life experience?". You know?

269
00:18:31.930 --> 00:18:36.510
So hopefully these 8 tips have inspired you to stop and take a look at yourself,

270
00:18:36.550 --> 00:18:41.300
Your life, your habits, your beliefs. You know? What you're doing with your time. All of that stuff.

271
00:18:41.510 --> 00:18:48.760
Because I genuinely believe, these 8 tips, if you can apply them consistently, your life will be better.

272
00:18:49.110 --> 00:18:51.470
And if you can apply them to your English learning process,

273
00:18:51.700 --> 00:18:54.910
You will learn faster and more effectively and have more fun doing it.

274
00:18:54.910 --> 00:18:57.880
And that's what it's about, man. Got to have fun. All right?

275
00:18:58.380 --> 00:19:01.470
So that's way longer than I thought I was going to.

276
00:19:01.980 --> 00:19:02.910
But we're going to get out of here, man.

277
00:19:02.910 --> 00:19:06.140
That's Coffee with Kaizen, number 20 in the books.

278
00:19:06.170 --> 00:19:08.030
So I will talk to you tomorrow.

279
00:19:08.920 --> 00:19:09.210
Peace!

00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:06.450
What's up, my friend? You already know this is the Life in
English podcast. I am Tony Kaizen, your communication

2
00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:12.560
sensei, here to drop some knowledge on you. Today, I'm going
to share something with you that will completely change the

3
00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:18.120
nature of your interactions with people. I'm going to share
the simple habit that helped me learn a foreign language

4
00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:23.910
without taking the course or traveling to a foreign country.
And this habit is the reason I'm able to make conversation

5
00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:28.680
with pretty much anyone I meet. And speaking of
conversations, I'm currently writing a book that will teach

6
00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:35.760
you how to have better conversations in English or any
language so be on the lookout for that in the future. For

7
00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:41.120
inspiration, I was thumbing through the book How to Win
Friends and Influence People by Dale Carnegie, and I came

8
00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:47.140
across an interesting chapter called Do This and You'll Be
Welcome Anywhere. And that's exactly what I'm going to share

9
00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:54.890
with you today. There are few things in this life that I can
guarantee you, but I'm absolutely certain that understanding

10
00:00:54.890 --> 00:01:01.430
and applying this concept will change your life as long as
you do it consistently. So let's not waste any more time.

11
00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:08.780
I'm gonna read you a few passages and summarize the ideas to
make sure you understand the most important parts. Let's do

12
00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:16.350
it. Passage number one. "Why read this book to find out how
to win friends?

13
00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:24.300
Why not study the technique of the greatest winner of
friends the world has ever known? Who is he? You may meet

14
00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:31.040
him tomorrow coming down the street. When you get within ten
feet of him, he will begin to wag his tail. If you stop and

15
00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:37.560
pat him, he will almost jump out of his skin to show you how
much he likes you. And you know that behind this show of

16
00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:43.750
affection on his part, there are no ulterior motives. He
doesn't want to sell you any real estate and he doesn't want

17
00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:53.030
to marry you. Did you ever stop to think that a dog is the
only animal that doesn't have to work for a living? A hen

18
00:01:53.120 --> 00:02:02.260
has to lay eggs. A cow has to give milk, and a canary has to
sing. But a dog makes his living by giving you nothing but

19
00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:09.280
love. When I was five years old, my father bought a
yellow-haired pup for $0.50.

20
00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:16.220
He was the light and joy of my childhood. Every afternoon,
about 4:30, he would sit in the front yard with his

21
00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:22.190
beautiful eyes, staring steadfastly at the path. And as soon
as he heard my voice or saw me swinging my dinner pail

22
00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:29.380
through the buck brush, he was off like a shot, racing
breathlessly up the hill to greet me with leaps of joy and

23
00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:39.340
barks of sheer ecstasy. Tippy was my constant companion for
five years. Then one tragic night -- I shall never forget --

24
00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:47.980
he was killed within ten feet of my head. Killed by
lightning. Tippy's death was the tragedy of my boyhood.

25
00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:58.140
You never read a book on psychology, Tippy. You didn't need
to. You knew by some divine instinct that you can make more

26
00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:04.260
friends in two months by becoming genuinely interested in
other people than you can in two years by trying to get

27
00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:12.710
other people interested in you. Let me repeat that. You can
make more friends in two months by becoming interested in

28
00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:21.080
other people than you can in two years by trying to get
other people interested in you. Yet I know, and you know,

29
00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:27.640
people who blunder through life trying to wigwag other
people into becoming interested in them. Of course, it

30
00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:35.910
doesn't work. People are not interested in you. They are not
interested in me. They are interested in themselves.

31
00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:45.140
Morning, noon, and after dinner. The New York telephone
company made a detailed study of telephone conversations to

32
00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:54.410
find out which word is the most frequently used. And you've
guessed it. It is the personal pronoun "I". I.

33
00:03:55.060 --> 00:04:01.080
I. It was used 3,900 times in 500 telephone conversations.

34
00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:02.630
I. I.

35
00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:13.020
I. I. When you see a group photograph that you are in, whose
picture do you look for first? If we merely try to impress

36
00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:22.210
people and get people interested in us, we will never have
many true, sincere friends. Friends. Real friends are not

37
00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:31.420
made that way. Napoleon tried it and in his last meeting
with Josephine, he said, 'Josephine, I've been as fortunate

38
00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:38.260
as any man ever was on this earth and yet at this hour, you
are the only person in the world on whom I can rely.' And

39
00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:48.830
historians doubt whether he could rely even on her. Alfred
Adler, the famous Viennese psychologist, wrote a book

40
00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:57.020
entitled What Life Should Mean to You. In that book, he says
it is the individual who is not interested in his fellow

41
00:04:57.020 --> 00:05:03.890
men, who has the greatest difficulties in life and provides
the greatest injury to others. It is from among such

42
00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:13.700
individuals that all human failures spring. You may read
scores of erudite tomes on psychology without coming across

43
00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:20.860
a statement more significant for you in me. Adler's
statement is so rich with meaning that I'm going to repeat

44
00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:28.580
it in italics. It is the individual who is not interested in
his fellow men, who has the greatest difficulties in life

45
00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:35.390
and provides the greatest injury to others. It's from among
such individuals that all human failures spring."

46
00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:45.960
Now, when I read this passage, the message I take away from
it is that trying to get people interested in you is a waste

47
00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:50.150
of time. It makes you seem selfish and boring.

48
00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:57.350
A lot of people spend their energy trying to impress others,
show themselves in a particular light and get people's

49
00:05:57.350 --> 00:06:03.870
attention. But if you really want to be someone that people
enjoy being around, then you've got to stop thinking so much

50
00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:13.530
about yourself and take interest in other people. So, let's
move on to passage number two.

51
00:06:16.890 --> 00:06:23.210
"George Dyke of North War in Pennsylvania, was forced to
retire from his service station business after 30 years when

52
00:06:23.210 --> 00:06:29.730
a new highway was constructed over the site of his station.
It wasn't long before the idle days of retirement began to

53
00:06:29.870 --> 00:06:36.700
bore him, so he started filling in his time trying to play
music and talk with many of the accomplished fiddlers. In

54
00:06:36.700 --> 00:06:42.360
his humble and friendly way, he became generally interested
in learning the background and interests of every musician

55
00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:51.040
he met. Although he was not a great fiddler himself, he made
many friends in this pursuit. He attended competitions and

56
00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:57.190
soon became known to the country music fans in the eastern
part of the United States as 'Uncle George, the Fiddle

57
00:06:57.190 --> 00:07:06.440
Scraper from Kinzua County'. When we heard Uncle George, he
was 72 and enjoying every minute of his life. By having a

58
00:07:06.440 --> 00:07:11.740
sustained interest in other people, he created a new life
for himself at a time when most people consider their

59
00:07:11.740 --> 00:07:21.390
productive years over." And this passage makes me think
about the experience of learning a foreign language as an

60
00:07:21.430 --> 00:07:28.220
adult. A lot of people think it's impossible to learn new
skills once they leave traditional school. They think the

61
00:07:28.220 --> 00:07:33.860
key to fluency in a foreign language is taking more classes,
buying more courses, and watching more YouTube videos. But

62
00:07:33.860 --> 00:07:41.650
the key is actually just taking interest in other people,
just like the man in the story. He wasn't a great musician

63
00:07:41.650 --> 00:07:48.990
in the beginning, and that didn't matter. He just decided to
immerse himself in the culture. He tried to learn from and

64
00:07:48.990 --> 00:07:55.730
connect with every musician he met. Over time, this allowed
him to create a network of musicians, and he became

65
00:07:55.730 --> 00:08:02.730
well-known all over the eastern United States. And that
scenario reminds me of the people who joined the Life in

66
00:08:02.730 --> 00:08:10.320
English community - people who have chosen to learn English
as a foreign language just using the Internet. The people in

67
00:08:10.320 --> 00:08:16.490
our community who make the most progress and have the most
fun are the people who simply choose to immerse themselves

68
00:08:16.570 --> 00:08:22.730
in the language. They're always consuming content in
English, starting conversations, asking questions about the

69
00:08:22.730 --> 00:08:28.950
language, and sharing things about their culture. They
understand that you join a community because you're

70
00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:35.490
interested in meeting and supporting people who have the
same goals and interests as you. And by taking interest in

71
00:08:35.570 --> 00:08:41.520
other members of the community, by making an effort to get
to know them, by constantly trying to learn and grow with

72
00:08:41.520 --> 00:08:49.670
them, you end up creating an environment in which everyone
benefits, including you. You can't experience the same

73
00:08:49.670 --> 00:08:56.900
growth when you're only thinking about yourself and what
other people can do for you. It's going to be really hard to

74
00:08:56.900 --> 00:09:04.870
learn a language if you're not interested in other people.
Alright.

75
00:09:05.400 --> 00:09:15.390
Let's move on to passage number three. "A show of interest,
as with every other principle of human relations must be

76
00:09:15.390 --> 00:09:23.410
sincere. It must pay off not only for the person showing the
interest, but for the person receiving the attention. It is

77
00:09:23.410 --> 00:09:26.690
a two-way street. Both parties benefit.

78
00:09:28.580 --> 00:09:33.890
Martin Ginsburg, who took our course in Long Island, New
York, reported how the special interest a nurse took in him

79
00:09:33.890 --> 00:09:40.530
profoundly affected his life. 'It was Thanksgiving Day and I
was ten years old.

80
00:09:41.600 --> 00:09:48.630
I was in a welfare ward of a city hospital and was scheduled
to undergo major orthopedic surgery the next day. I knew

81
00:09:48.630 --> 00:09:56.370
that I could only look forward to months of confinement,
convalescence, and pain. My father was dead. My mother and I

82
00:09:56.370 --> 00:10:04.460
lived alone in a small apartment, and we were on welfare. My
mother was unable to visit me that day. As the day went on,

83
00:10:04.850 --> 00:10:11.660
I became overwhelmed with the feeling of loneliness,
despair, and fear. I knew my mother was at home alone

84
00:10:11.660 --> 00:10:17.620
worrying about me not having anyone to be with, not having
anyone to eat with, and not even having enough money to

85
00:10:17.620 --> 00:10:24.950
afford a Thanksgiving dinner. The tears welled up in my eyes
and I stuck my head under the pillow and pulled the covers

86
00:10:24.950 --> 00:10:29.770
over it. I cried silently, but oh so bitterly.

87
00:10:31.020 --> 00:10:39.520
So much that my body wracked with pain. A young student
nurse heard my sobbing and came over to me. She took the

88
00:10:39.520 --> 00:10:46.360
covers off my face and started wiping my tears. She told me
how lonely she was having to work that day and not being

89
00:10:46.360 --> 00:10:54.160
able to be with her family. She asked me whether I would
have dinner with her. She brought two trays of food - sliced

90
00:10:54.160 --> 00:11:02.810
turkey, mashed potatoes, cranberry sauce, and ice cream for
dessert. She talked to me and tried to calm my fears. Even

91
00:11:02.810 --> 00:11:10.570
though she was scheduled to go off duty at 4 p.m., she
stayed on her own time until almost 11 p.m.. She played

92
00:11:10.570 --> 00:11:18.350
games with me, talked to me, and stayed with me until I
finally fell asleep. Many Thanksgivings have come and gone

93
00:11:18.350 --> 00:11:25.990
since I was ten. But one never passes without me remembering
that particular one and my feelings of frustration, fear,

94
00:11:26.620 --> 00:11:35.040
loneliness, and the warmth and tenderness of the stranger
that somehow made it all bearable.' If you want others to

95
00:11:35.040 --> 00:11:41.800
like you, if you want to develop real relationships, if you
want to help others at the same time as you help yourself,

96
00:11:42.570 --> 00:11:51.840
keep this principle in mind. Become genuinely interested in
other people. Do this and you'll be welcome anywhere."

97
00:11:57.400 --> 00:12:02.660
Now, over the years, I've come to realize that the majority
of people in this world don't get much love, attention,

98
00:12:03.040 --> 00:12:08.250
respect, or admiration. Most people don't ever get listened
to.

99
00:12:09.790 --> 00:12:14.580
And when you choose to be the one that takes interest in
another person and shows them some love, there's no telling

100
00:12:14.580 --> 00:12:20.830
what kind of effect that's going to have on them long term.
There have been so many cases when someone chose to share

101
00:12:20.830 --> 00:12:27.380
very personal information with me. Things have never told
their families or best friends just because I was the first

102
00:12:27.380 --> 00:12:34.650
person who truly took the time to listen to what they had to
say. Because instead of judging them, I was seeking to

103
00:12:34.730 --> 00:12:43.730
understand them better. People will tell you all kinds of
things once they know you're truly listening. I remember

104
00:12:43.730 --> 00:12:49.140
comments that I received years ago just because I almost
never receive compliments growing up. So when somebody

105
00:12:49.220 --> 00:12:55.890
actually takes the time to not only notice something about
me, but then tell me what they noticed, I end up thinking

106
00:12:55.890 --> 00:13:02.770
about it for a long time. Like them, I can't believe someone
was paying so much attention to me and cared enough to let

107
00:13:02.770 --> 00:13:10.100
me know about it. Now, this might sound counterintuitive to
you, but it's an idea that I'd like you to experiment with

108
00:13:10.100 --> 00:13:19.940
in the future. If you want to receive something, try giving
some of it first. If you want more love from people,

109
00:13:20.890 --> 00:13:30.680
show more love to people. If you want more respect from
people, show more respect to people. If you want

110
00:13:30.680 --> 00:13:39.510
people to be more interested in you, show more interest in
people. Obviously these are general statements. I'm not

111
00:13:39.510 --> 00:13:45.810
saying you should show love, respect, and interest to people
who clearly don't like you or want to be around you. Do not

112
00:13:45.810 --> 00:13:51.880
degrade yourself by chasing people. If you're chasing
something, that means it's actively trying to get away from

113
00:13:51.920 --> 00:13:59.340
you. So it's probably best to just let it go, you feel me? 
What I'm saying is, be the person who extends their hand

114
00:13:59.340 --> 00:14:06.460
first, literally and figuratively speaking. Greet the world
with the energy you would like to receive.

115
00:14:10.020 --> 00:14:15.430
Alright, there you have it, my friend. The key to better
interactions, deeper relationships, and a stronger network

116
00:14:15.430 --> 00:14:23.130
is becoming genuinely interested in other people. In a world
where everyone is only interested in themselves, only

117
00:14:23.130 --> 00:14:28.930
interested in what they can get from other people, only
interested in talking, only interested in how much money,

118
00:14:29.020 --> 00:14:36.400
attention, and validation they can get for themselves, I'm
asking you to walk in the other direction. I'm asking you to

119
00:14:36.400 --> 00:14:44.250
take interest in other people. I'm asking you to step
outside of yourself and into someone else's shoes. I'm

120
00:14:44.250 --> 00:14:50.700
asking you to be curious, to think deeper, to ask better
questions, and to develop empathy for the people you meet.

121
00:14:52.710 --> 00:14:58.940
If you can do this, you'll learn more about this world and
the people in it than you ever imagined possible. People

122
00:14:58.940 --> 00:15:05.890
will enjoy speaking to you so much more. You will conquer
your fear of speaking to strangers. You'll be able to talk

123
00:15:05.890 --> 00:15:08.860
to anyone anytime, anywhere.

00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:06.010
Tony Kaizen:
What's up, my friend? This is the Life in English podcast.
I'm your host, Tony Kaizen, and in this episode, you're

2
00:00:06.010 --> 00:00:12.300
going to be entertained by the legendary stand-up comedian
Dave Chappelle. Now, in this clip I'm about to play, Dave

3
00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:17.570
tells a hilarious story about the first time he tried
psychedelic mushrooms. So I'm going to play the whole thing

4
00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:23.280
from start to finish and then go back and explain some
keywords and phrases to make sure you understand the entire

5
00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:28.290
story. And if you want to learn more about Dave Chappelle
and his work, you can check out the links in the description

6
00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:31.480
of this episode. Alright? Let's get started.

7
00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:37.940
Dave Chappelle:
Can't do everything! Maybe weed!

8
00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:44.350
If you're gonna do something, do a little weed, smoke
some...weed... Weed is not as bad as everything else. Weed

9
00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:52.830
is a background substance. I mean, you can smoke some herb
and still function. You ain't crisp...but

10
00:00:55.610 --> 00:01:02.580
you'll function! Nothing higher than weed, though. I made
that mistake one time.

11
00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:10.680
I...I was at a party. Some guy gave me some shit. He's like,
"Here, man, take this. It's fucking mushrooms." I took it. I

12
00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:17.080
forgot all about it, you know? Then a couple of days later,
I found that shit in my pocket. I'm thinking, "Why not?" Cos

13
00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:23.230
I'm thinking it's like weed, some background shit. I planned
my whole day out like it was weed.

14
00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:33.090
I'll chew this shit up. Then I'll go to the barber shop, get
my hair cut, and then I'll see a movie. I

15
00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:44.790
chewed it up. So far, so good. Then I was in the barbershop,
like, an hour later.

16
00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:52.660
And it's funny cos I was just thinking to myself, I was
like, "Oh, *smack* *smack*, this stuff sucks!" Tastes like

17
00:01:52.660 --> 00:02:00.410
athlete's foot. I feel sick, but I'm not really high.

18
00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:07.270
Then I looked in the mirror. I saw the barber's reflection,
man.

19
00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:14.460
It looked like...it looked like a big penis was cutting my
hair.

20
00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:21.330
I freaked out! I started talking to myself, "Dave, calm
down. You're on drugs.

21
00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:29.180
This is what drugs do. Okay, you know that there was no
way...that

22
00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:39.840
a penis can cut hair." Boy, I started freaking out, man!

23
00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:46.920
I just couldn't take it anymore. I jumped out of the chair.
Half my hair was cut, I didn't (even) care! I didn't. I just

24
00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:51.450
gave a barber a handful of money. It was weird - the balls
opened up.

25
00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:56.240
Anyway, I...I ran home, man.

26
00:02:56.240 --> 00:03:05.570
I ran home as fast as I could. I was trippin! Trippin! I
looked at the clock. It was 02:42. I was like, "Damn, 02:42!

27
00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:14.440
I gotta sober up. I've never been this high this early!" I
took a shower.

28
00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:22.920
I was still high. I said, "Maybe music will do the trick!" I
listened to every CD I had.

29
00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:26.290
I was still high.

30
00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:34.650
"Exercise! That's what I'll do." I ran around the block four
times, still high. Took a nap, woke up, fucked up.

31
00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:41.210
I looked at the clock. It was 02:43! I said, "Goddamn!"

32
00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:50.670
Tony Kaizen:
Alright, my friend, like I always say, do not feel bad if
you didn't get the whole idea or you didn't understand every

33
00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:55.960
single word, cos now we're going to go back and listen to
the story little by little while I explain some keywords and

34
00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:59.350
phrases to make sure you understand everything. So let's do
it.

35
00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.820
Dave Chappelle:
Can't do everything! Maybe weed!

36
00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:11.260
If we gotta do something, do a little weed, smoke
some...weed... Weed is not as bad as everything else. Weed

37
00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:19.720
is a background substance. I mean, you can smoke some herb
and still function. You ain't crisp...but

38
00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:26.640
you'll function! Nothing higher than weed, though.

39
00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:34.450
Tony Kaizen:
Alright. I wanna stop here and explain the term "background
substance". Background substance isn't a term we actually

40
00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:40.240
use in daily speech. When Dave uses the term "background
substance", he's being funny and playing with the original

41
00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:46.320
terms, which are "background music" and "background noise".
And these terms just describe the music or noise that can be

42
00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:51.830
heard while doing some other activity. For example, you
might like having some background noise while you work

43
00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:57.790
because it helps you focus. Or you might be eating at a
restaurant while they play some background music that's loud

44
00:04:57.790 --> 00:05:02.890
enough to be heard but not loud enough to interrupt your
conversation. You see what I'm saying? It's just playing in

45
00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:08.580
the background to create a nice atmosphere. Now, you
probably got this by using the context of the situation, but

46
00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:16.090
just in case you didn't, the word "herb", h-e-r-b, in this
case, is slang for weed or marijuana. So you can smoke some

47
00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:17.320
weed and still function.

48
00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:28.140
Dave Chappelle:
I mean, you can smoke some herb and still function. You
ain't crisp...but you'll function.

49
00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:36.090
Tony Kaizen:
In this context, when Dave says, "You ain't crisp", he's
basically saying that, "You're not sharp." And in this case,

50
00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:42.810
the word "sharp" means having or showing speed of
perception, comprehension, or response. In other words, Dave

51
00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:48.620
is saying, when you smoke weed, your brain is not operating
at peak capacity; you're not sharp; you can't respond

52
00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:55.150
quickly; you might not always know what's going on, but at
least you can function. But with psychedelic mushrooms, it's

53
00:05:55.150 --> 00:05:55.590
not like that.

54
00:05:57.180 --> 00:06:01.580
Dave Chappelle:
And you ain't crisp...but you'll function.

55
00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:10.530
Nothing higher than weed, though. I made that mistake one
time. I was at a party. Some guy gave me some shit. He's

56
00:06:10.530 --> 00:06:16.020
like, "Here, man, take this. It's fucking mushrooms." I took
it.

57
00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:21.160
I forgot all about it, you know? Then a couple of days
later, I found that shit in my pocket. I'm thinking, "Why

58
00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:24.880
not?" Cos I'm thinking it's like weed, some background shit.

59
00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:33.380
Tony Kaizen:
The English word "shit" has multiple meanings, but in this
case, it's being used to say "thing" or "stuff". So when he

60
00:06:33.380 --> 00:06:39.150
says, "This guy gave me some shit," he's basically saying,
"This guy gave me something," right? And when he says, "A

61
00:06:39.210 --> 00:06:45.120
couple of days later, I found that shit in my pocket," he's
saying, "A couple of days later, I found that thing in my

62
00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:46.240
pocket." It's the same thing.

63
00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:53.880
Dave Chappelle:
Cos I'm thinking it's like weed, some background shit. I
planned my whole day out like it was weed.

64
00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:02.420
I'll chew this shit up, then I go to the barber shop, get my
hair cut, and then I'll see a movie.

65
00:07:06.010 --> 00:07:11.630
Tony Kaizen:
The phrasal verb "to plan something out" basically means to
plan what you're going to do in the future, but carefully

66
00:07:11.670 --> 00:07:17.490
and in detail. And you might be wondering, what's the
difference between "plan" and "plan out"? Well, in this

67
00:07:17.490 --> 00:07:22.670
case, there's really no difference. "Plan out" is a more
colloquial way of saying the same thing. In some cases,

68
00:07:22.670 --> 00:07:29.000
using the phrasal verb "to plan out" can imply that you plan
things in great detail. Right? More time and preparation

69
00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:33.430
were needed to make your plan. But in this case, plan and
plan out are the same thing.

70
00:07:35.660 --> 00:07:45.090
Dave Chappelle:
I planned my whole day out like it was weed. I'll chew this
shit up, then I'll go to the barber shop, get my hair cut,

71
00:07:45.090 --> 00:07:46.130
and then I'll see a movie.

72
00:07:49.830 --> 00:07:55.480
Tony Kaizen:
If you look in the dictionary, it'll tell you that the
phrasal verb "chew up" means to destroy. For example, "The

73
00:07:55.480 --> 00:08:01.410
dog chewed up the furniture", meaning he destroyed the
furniture by chewing on it constantly. But in this case,

74
00:08:01.680 --> 00:08:08.710
"chew up", it just means to chew thoroughly and swallow. So
Dave could have said, "I'll eat this shit, go to the barber

75
00:08:08.710 --> 00:08:14.110
shop, and then I'll see a movie," and it would have been the
same exact thing. It would have had the same exact meaning,

76
00:08:14.270 --> 00:08:14.550
you see?

77
00:08:14.960 --> 00:08:20.650
And just like the phrasal verb "plan out", the phrasal verb
"chew up" is being used colloquially. And you might hear

78
00:08:20.650 --> 00:08:27.190
someone say, "Eat up," which is just another way of
encouraging someone to eat and enjoy all of their food. Or

79
00:08:27.190 --> 00:08:32.410
you might hear someone say, "Drink up," which is just
another way of encouraging someone to drink their entire

80
00:08:32.410 --> 00:08:33.530
beverage. You see what I'm saying?

81
00:08:36.030 --> 00:08:43.250
Dave Chappelle:
I'll chew this shit up, then I'll go to the barbershop, get
my hair cut, and then I'll see a movie. I

82
00:08:46.200 --> 00:08:53.490
chewed it up. So far, so good. Then I was in the barbershop,
like an hour later.

83
00:08:55.310 --> 00:09:02.420
Tony Kaizen:
"So far, so good." This phrase is used to say that progress
has been satisfactory up to now. In other words, we haven't

84
00:09:02.420 --> 00:09:05.190
had any problems yet; everything seems to be okay.

85
00:09:07.170 --> 00:09:13.550
Dave Chappelle:
Then I was in the barbershop, like, an hour later. And it's
funny cos I was just thinking to myself, I was like, "Oh,

86
00:09:13.550 --> 00:09:23.130
*smack* *smack*, this stuff sucks!" Tastes like athlete's
foot. I feel sick, but I'm not really

87
00:09:25.480 --> 00:09:25.540
high.

88
00:09:26.240 --> 00:09:33.780
Tony Kaizen:
If something sucks, it means that it's very bad in terms of
quality and or performance. So if the drugs suck, that means

89
00:09:33.780 --> 00:09:36.630
that the quality is low so the effects are not very strong.

90
00:09:37.590 --> 00:09:47.380
Dave Chappelle:
"Oh, *smack* *smack* this stuff sucks!" Tastes like
athlete's foot. I feel sick, but I'm not really

91
00:09:49.740 --> 00:09:49.800
high.

92
00:09:50.100 --> 00:09:55.570
Tony Kaizen:
Athlete's foot is a fungal infection that usually starts
between your toes. So you can Google the term "athlete's

93
00:09:55.570 --> 00:10:02.600
foot", see a picture of it, and then imagine what it would
taste like if you licked that foot. Dave is basically saying

94
00:10:02.600 --> 00:10:04.450
that's what psychedelic mushrooms taste like.

95
00:10:07.270 --> 00:10:15.050
Dave Chappelle:
"...tastes like athlete's foot." I feel sick, but I'm not
really high.

96
00:10:16.090 --> 00:10:22.230
Tony Kaizen:
The word "high" in this case is probably the most common way
to say that someone is under the influence of drugs. So when

97
00:10:22.230 --> 00:10:29.750
we drink alcohol, we get drunk. But when we consume any
other drug like things that we smoke or eat or inject, then

98
00:10:29.750 --> 00:10:30.210
we get high.

99
00:10:33.690 --> 00:10:38.880
Dave Chappelle:
I feel sick, but I'm not really high.

100
00:10:39.420 --> 00:10:45.740
Then I looked in the mirror. I saw the barber's reflection,
man.

101
00:10:47.700 --> 00:10:53.660
It looked like...it looked like a big penis was cutting my
hair. I freaked out!

102
00:10:55.490 --> 00:11:02.420
Tony Kaizen:
"I freaked out!" If someone "freaks out" or if something
"freaks them out", they suddenly feel extremely surprised or

103
00:11:02.420 --> 00:11:09.040
upset or angry or confused or even scared. So you can
imagine your reaction if you saw your barber turn into a

104
00:11:09.040 --> 00:11:14.680
penis. Right? You'd probably freak out. You'd go crazy.
You'd be extremely scared or maybe surprised or something

105
00:11:14.680 --> 00:11:14.990
like that.

106
00:11:17.230 --> 00:11:25.560
Dave Chappelle:
It looked like a big penis was cutting my hair. I freaked
out! I started talking to myself, "Dave, calm down.

107
00:11:27.110 --> 00:11:30.610
You're on drugs. This is what drugs do.

108
00:11:31.480 --> 00:11:40.670
Okay, you know that there was no way...that a penis

109
00:11:41.580 --> 00:11:46.740
can cut hair." And I started freaking out, man!

110
00:11:46.740 --> 00:11:47.890
I just couldn't take it anymore.

111
00:11:49.340 --> 00:11:55.970
Tony Kaizen:
"I just couldn't take it anymore." When someone says, "I
can't take it", it means that they're unable to endure or

112
00:11:55.970 --> 00:12:02.980
tolerate some unpleasant, critical, harsh or abusive
treatment, whether it's physical or emotional; they just

113
00:12:02.980 --> 00:12:09.590
can't stand it anymore or they can't take it anymore; they
cannot tolerate it anymore. So Dave was just overwhelmed by

114
00:12:09.670 --> 00:12:12.810
all of the crazy shit he was seeing after eating the
mushrooms.

115
00:12:15.530 --> 00:12:21.420
Dave Chappelle:
And I started freaking out, man! I just couldn't take it
anymore. I jumped out of the chair. Half my hair was cut, I

116
00:12:21.420 --> 00:12:23.250
didn't (even) care!

117
00:12:23.280 --> 00:12:25.540
I didn't. I just gave a barber a handful of money.

118
00:12:28.040 --> 00:12:36.350
Tony Kaizen:
"I jumped out of the chair." The dictionary says "jump out"
means "to propel oneself upward over a distance in a single

119
00:12:36.350 --> 00:12:43.760
quick motion or series of such motions". So all you need to
imagine here is someone quickly rising from a chair almost

120
00:12:43.760 --> 00:12:48.260
in a jumping motion because they were freaked out or scared
by something they saw.

121
00:12:49.660 --> 00:12:55.860
Dave Chappelle:
I jumped out of the chair. Half my hair was cut, I didn't
(even) care! I didn't. I just gave a barber a handful of

122
00:12:55.860 --> 00:12:56.070
money.

123
00:12:58.170 --> 00:13:04.380
Tony Kaizen:
In this context, a "handful" of something simply refers to a
quantity that fills the hand. So you might have a handful of

124
00:13:04.380 --> 00:13:10.610
money. You might have a handful of candy. You might have a
handful of peanuts. It could be anything. And it just means

125
00:13:10.610 --> 00:13:13.570
whatever you're holding is enough to fill your hand
completely.

126
00:13:15.350 --> 00:13:21.550
Dave Chappelle:
I jumped out of the chair. Half my hair was cut, I didn't
(even) care! I didn't. I just gave a barber a handful of

127
00:13:21.550 --> 00:13:29.830
money. It was weird - the balls opened up. Anyway, I...I ran
home, man.

128
00:13:29.930 --> 00:13:31.570
I ran home as fast as I could.

129
00:13:33.110 --> 00:13:39.490
Tony Kaizen:
The phrasal verb "open up" has multiple meanings, but in
this case, it means to open by separating. So this might be

130
00:13:39.490 --> 00:13:47.340
weird to think about, but you can picture two balls side by
side, and when they open up, they separate and a hand comes

131
00:13:47.400 --> 00:13:51.740
out of the space in the middle to receive the money. That's
basically what Dave was describing.

132
00:13:52.070 --> 00:13:58.330
And the word, "anyway", in this context is being used to
resume a subject after an interruption. Right? Because Dave

133
00:13:58.330 --> 00:14:04.300
was telling the story, then he got distracted by the part
about the balls, and then he said "anyway", and returned to

134
00:14:04.300 --> 00:14:05.900
the original topic. You see what I'm saying?

135
00:14:07.370 --> 00:14:14.240
Dave Chappelle:
It was weird - the balls opened up. Anyway, I...I ran home,
man.

136
00:14:14.340 --> 00:14:23.400
I ran home as fast as I could. I was trippin! Trippin! I
looked at the clock. It was 02:42. I was like, "Damn, 02:42!

137
00:14:24.130 --> 00:14:27.910
I gotta sober up. I've never been this high this early!"

138
00:14:30.960 --> 00:14:37.110
Tony Kaizen:
To "sober up" means to become sober or to become less drunk
or less high, which is practically the same thing.

139
00:14:38.680 --> 00:14:46.810
Dave Chappelle:
"...I gotta sober up. I've never been this high this early!"
I took a shower.

140
00:14:47.840 --> 00:14:55.300
I was still high. I said, "Maybe music will do the trick!" I
listened to every CD I had.

141
00:14:56.400 --> 00:14:58.830
I was still high.

142
00:14:58.830 --> 00:15:06.930
"Exercise! That's what I'll do." I ran around the block four
times, still high. Took a nap, woke up, fucked up.

143
00:15:09.910 --> 00:15:17.550
Tony Kaizen:
"Took a nap, woke up, fucked up." The phrasal verb "to wake
up" means to stop sleeping, and to be "fucked up" in this

144
00:15:17.550 --> 00:15:25.560
context means to be intoxicated from drugs or alcohol. So
someone might say, "Man, I was so fucked up last night." And

145
00:15:25.560 --> 00:15:32.390
that means that they were extremely intoxicated last night.
So in an attempt to sober up, Dave tried to take a nap, but

146
00:15:32.390 --> 00:15:35.480
he woke up and he was still high. That's the idea you can
understand.

147
00:15:37.570 --> 00:15:46.590
Dave Chappelle:
I ran around the block four times, still high. Took a nap,
woke up, fucked up.

148
00:15:46.590 --> 00:15:51.940
I looked at the clock. It was 02:43! I said, "Goddamn!"

149
00:15:52.140 --> 00:15:58.660
Tony Kaizen:
"Goddamn!" The phrase "goddamn" is used to express anger or
annoyance with someone or something. So after taking a

150
00:15:58.660 --> 00:16:05.220
shower, listening to music, running around the block and
taking a nap, Dave was still fucked up. He was still high,

151
00:16:05.560 --> 00:16:13.950
he was still intoxicated. So naturally he was annoyed and he
said, "Goddamn!" Right? Like, "Shit man, I'm still high? I

152
00:16:13.950 --> 00:16:17.440
gotta find a way to sober up." You know what I'm saying?
That's the idea.

153
00:16:19.680 --> 00:16:24.830
Dave Chappelle:
Took a nap, woke up, fucked up.

154
00:16:24.830 --> 00:16:28.160
I looked at the clock. It was 02:43! I said, "Goddamn!"

155
00:16:30.190 --> 00:16:35.070
Tony Kaizen:
Alright, my friend. As I always say, don't feel bad if you
still have trouble understanding every single word and

156
00:16:35.070 --> 00:16:41.610
phrase in clips like this one. Comedy is almost a hundred
percent based on culture, and comedians use lots of slang

157
00:16:41.610 --> 00:16:46.970
and expressions when they speak. So naturally, you'd have to
be extremely familiar with the language and culture to

158
00:16:47.020 --> 00:16:52.890
understand everything one hundred percent of the time. The
most important thing for you to do is review lessons like

159
00:16:52.890 --> 00:16:58.170
this one and start putting new words and phrases into
practice so you can really internalize their various

160
00:16:58.170 --> 00:17:03.390
meanings and the different ways we use them in casual
speech. But that's it for now, my friend. Thank you so much

161
00:17:03.390 --> 00:17:08.720
for your time and attention. I really hope you enjoyed this
episode. This is the Life in English podcast. I'm your host,

162
00:17:08.720 --> 00:17:12.810
Tony Kaizen, and I'll talk to you in the next one. Peace!

00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:04.210
What's up, everybody? You're listening to another episode of Life in English.

2
00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:07.990
I'm your host, Tony Kaizen. And in this episode,

3
00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:13.260
I'm going to share a conversation I had with my friend Guilherme from Mogi das Cruzes, Brazil.

4
00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:15.670
He recently joined the Life in English community.

5
00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:20.750
So I got a chance to sit down and talk to him about how he managed to learn English by himself

6
00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:23.450
In less than two years without leaving his home.

7
00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:27.570
But also I talked to him about the mindset he had during that learning process

8
00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:30.940
And also what motivated him to join the Life in English community.

9
00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:33.410
So I really hope you guys enjoy this conversation.

10
00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:36.140
Maybe you get some tips or tricks or ideas,

11
00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:39.110
Or maybe you feel motivated to join the community as well.

12
00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:43.250
And if you'd like more information about the Life in English community and how to join,

13
00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:46.090
You can visit lifeinenglish.net/vip.

14
00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:50.330
But we're not going to waste any more time, my friend.

15
00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:52.520
Let's get right into this conversation.

16
00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:56.510
Guilherme:
Can you hear me?

17
00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:58.150
Tony Kaizen:
I can hear you perfectly. Yeah.

18
00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:04.150
Guilherme:
Okay. This is the first time I'm speaking English.

19
00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:15.040
Usually, I listen to English, not speak. So I'm nervous because of that.

20
00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.960
Tony Kaizen:
I got you, man. It's totally normal, I think.

21
00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:28.830
But it's hard to believe this is the very first time you're speaking English with another human being because you can actually speak.

22
00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:33.830
So how have you learned to speak if you have no one to speak to?

23
00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:40.270
Guilherme:
And I don't know. I really don't. Just speaking.

24
00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:53.290
A long time ago, I saw a teacher, a Brazilian teacher and he is having Instagram, English, Black Friday.

25
00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:58.960
He's teaching black English. I don't know if you call black English.

26
00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:01.770
Tony Kaizen:
Yeah, you can. Black English. Sure.

27
00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:14.550
Guilherme:
He said, If you listen a lot of English or enough English, when you...

28
00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:19.370
When you have to speak it's more easily. Because...

29
00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:20.370
Tony Kaizen:
Easier. Yeah.

30
00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:28.690
Guilherme:
Easier. Okay. Easier. It's easier because you're listening to a lot of English.

31
00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:38.850
So I don't know if it's true or not, but I'm just speaking. I don't know if it's right or wrong.

32
00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:54.690
But I... I don't have, I'm not nervous because of speaking or video or etc.

33
00:02:55.260 --> 00:03:00.780
It's English. English. Speaking English. It's hard. Definitely.

34
00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:05.490
Tony Kaizen:
Well, I also don't know if it's true, but it's clearly working, man.

35
00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:09.920
If I'm the first person that you've spoken English with, but you can still,

36
00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:13.280
You know, express yourself in a basic way, I imagine you understand what I'm saying.

37
00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:16.830
So obviously it's working, man. It's working.

38
00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:20.580
Whatever you're doing, shit. That's cool though.

39
00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:29.450
Guilherme:
I understand you perfectly because before I was watching

40
00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:38.920
Because I didn't know you produce content to YouTube or Instagram, I just follow you on TikTok.

41
00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:49.530
So yesterday I saw a video of you... a video and you talk about the Life in English.

42
00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:57.980
Okay, this is it. That's what I need. And I just click the link.

43
00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:00.760
Hey, all this stuff, you know.

44
00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:01.300
Tony Kaizen:
Yeah, yeah.

45
00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:15.260
Guilherme:
And I think this, I can pay for this. So I had one problem.

46
00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:20.520
I didn't have a credit card. Credit card. Cartão de crédito. Credit card.

47
00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:21.370
Tony Kaizen:
Credit card. Exactly.

48
00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:32.620
Guilherme:
And I just made one. Because I thought, I need this. I need to speak.

49
00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:46.350
I need to speak to other people speaking English. And I don't know why it's so barato.

50
00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:48.410
I don't know say... How you say in English. Barato.

51
00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:49.020
Tony Kaizen:
Cheap.

52
00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:56.960
Guilherme:
I think it's cheap. Okay. And here we go, I'm enjoying the community.

53
00:04:57.310 --> 00:05:01.290
It's so difficult to say this word. Community.

54
00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:04.530
Tony Kaizen:
It is, man. Even for me. Community. It's challenging. Yeah.

55
00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:13.020
Guilherme:
Community. And I... The podcast and I'm a big fan of podcasts.

56
00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:23.050
I listen a lot of podcasts, a lot of podcasts and I say, okay, there's no grammar,

57
00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:28.890
Basically. Just a grammar guide. And I, I like the...

58
00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:35.810
This word is harder. Estrutura. Structure.

59
00:05:35.970 --> 00:05:38.050
Tony Kaizen:
Structure. That was good, man. Structure.

60
00:05:38.850 --> 00:05:42.750
Guilherme:
Structure of your curse. Curse, course.

61
00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:43.150
Tony Kaizen:
Course.

62
00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:47.630
Guilherme:
Curse is maldição. It's curse of dragon like Yu-Gi-Oh monster.

63
00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:55.110
I like it and say, okay, this is perfect, is this perfect for me.

64
00:05:57.020 --> 00:05:59.970
Tony Kaizen:
I think you did a great job of describing it, man. Like you,

65
00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:03.520
Basically told me what you were doing before and now.

66
00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:08.060
Because it sounds like up until this point you were just learning by yourself.

67
00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:11.150
You've never taken any course or gone to like, an English school, have you?

68
00:06:12.450 --> 00:06:15.630
Guilherme:
Nope. I just learned it for myself.

69
00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:18.860
Tony Kaizen:
How long? How long have you been learning English?

70
00:06:20.220 --> 00:06:28.980
Guilherme:
I'm thinking something like one and a half years, two years.

71
00:06:29.750 --> 00:06:35.530
Something like that. Because I never, I never studied English, you know?

72
00:06:35.990 --> 00:06:43.970
I never take a notebook and write. No, I just...

73
00:06:45.310 --> 00:06:53.290
Watching videos, subtitled videos, and with subtitles in Portuguese.

74
00:06:54.420 --> 00:07:08.700
And my strategy was there is a lot of movies I watched my whole life. Okay? You understand me?

75
00:07:08.770 --> 00:07:08.910
Tony Kaizen:
Yeah!

76
00:07:08.910 --> 00:07:18.250
Guilherme:
My whole life. So I know the dialogues. I know the words they're saying.

77
00:07:18.900 --> 00:07:25.700
So I just watch in English with subtitles in English and association.

78
00:07:26.700 --> 00:07:36.110
Oh, this is that. That is this. And how to say "decorrer do tempo"? Passar do tempo.

79
00:07:36.170 --> 00:07:37.680
Tony Kaizen:
Overtime. Overtime.

80
00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:47.240
Guilherme:
Overtime. Overtime I just, I just understand the words without subtitles.

81
00:07:47.510 --> 00:07:47.960
Tony Kaizen:
Understood.

82
00:07:48.070 --> 00:07:59.850
Guilherme:
Understood the word without subtitles. And just doing the same thing, the same thing every day.

83
00:07:59.850 --> 00:08:08.510
Every day, watching, listening, and podcasts and the same thing, the same thing, the same thing.

84
00:08:08.510 --> 00:08:18.680
And I learn how to understand, how I understand people talking. So that's it.

85
00:08:19.380 --> 00:08:22.470
I never study grammar or something like that.

86
00:08:22.470 --> 00:08:29.160
And Rapid podcast and YouTube videos and series, movies, etc. Basically.

87
00:08:30.160 --> 00:08:33.800
Tony Kaizen:
And that last piece of the puzzle, man, that one missing thing,

88
00:08:33.820 --> 00:08:37.460
It sounds like was the speaking part. Just having real people to talk to.

89
00:08:39.060 --> 00:08:48.090
Guilherme:
Yeah. Something I notice... I think that's the word.

90
00:08:48.490 --> 00:08:59.990
I notice is the English for lessons or in English schools, it's not the real English.

91
00:09:00.270 --> 00:09:15.390
Definitely. So I... But back. The first time I tried to learn from English schools,

92
00:09:15.630 --> 00:09:26.080
English lessons and notebooks, books and grammar and the to be verbs and etc..

93
00:09:26.880 --> 00:09:37.190
And when I'm watching the movie in English but Portuguese subtitles, I didn't understand.

94
00:09:38.640 --> 00:09:45.170
And I thought, this is not... This is on the book. In the book.

95
00:09:46.410 --> 00:09:46.850
Tony Kaizen:
In the book.

96
00:09:47.500 --> 00:09:54.920
Guilherme:
In the book is not the real English. I need real English. I need here, real English.

97
00:09:55.830 --> 00:10:04.000
Then I started to what I say, what I said. Associations.

98
00:10:04.580 --> 00:10:13.280
English, Portuguese, subtitles, the movies and series. And I learned how to understood.

99
00:10:14.280 --> 00:10:15.100
Tony Kaizen:
How to understand.

100
00:10:15.990 --> 00:10:20.470
Guilherme:
How to understand. The verbs, the verbs...

101
00:10:20.470 --> 00:10:22.500
Tony Kaizen:
Higher tenses. Yeah. Yeah.

102
00:10:22.830 --> 00:10:31.860
Guilherme:
Because I never studied grammar. So that's it, I think is it.

103
00:10:33.320 --> 00:10:35.420
Tony Kaizen:
I mean, to me, it's impressive, man. You just said it yourself.

104
00:10:35.420 --> 00:10:38.790
You never studied grammar, but you understand spoken English.

105
00:10:38.860 --> 00:10:42.050
And this is the first time... It's still so crazy to me.

106
00:10:42.050 --> 00:10:47.690
This is the first time you're speaking English to a real person and you can communicate and make yourself understood, man.

107
00:10:47.920 --> 00:10:53.910
And it just sounds to me like I know you don't know for sure if what you're doing is the right way to do it

108
00:10:53.910 --> 00:10:58.730
Or if you should be doing other things. But clearly, like I said, what you're doing is working man,

109
00:10:58.800 --> 00:11:03.200
And you haven't spent years at a school or taking fancy courses or anything like that.

110
00:11:03.200 --> 00:11:09.690
It's just talking and listening, right? It really is that simple sometimes.

111
00:11:10.880 --> 00:11:18.530
Guilherme:
I don't know if I say all the time people on the Internet and say how to speak,

112
00:11:18.860 --> 00:11:27.870
How to understand the native speakers. Just listen to native speakers.

113
00:11:29.550 --> 00:11:37.380
Just listen to native speakers speaking. There's no secrets. There's no nothing.

114
00:11:37.380 --> 00:11:41.760
There's no key it's just listen, listen, listen, listen, listen.

115
00:11:42.470 --> 00:11:47.340
And you understand they speaking. Just works for me.

116
00:11:48.400 --> 00:11:53.050
Tony Kaizen:
Hey, it works for me too, man. It works for me too, shit.

117
00:11:53.050 --> 00:12:05.080
Guilherme:
It's just... So I don't know and like I said, I was watching your videos and I noticed it.

118
00:12:05.350 --> 00:12:16.460
You is... You do the same things with Portuguese and Spanish. These two languages.

119
00:12:17.380 --> 00:12:23.770
You listen and listen and don't know if you study grammar or something like that,

120
00:12:24.230 --> 00:12:32.310
But you listen a lot of native speakers speaking. So I thought, okay, I'm in the right way.

121
00:12:35.050 --> 00:12:38.910
Tony Kaizen:
Yep. Exactly, man. Exactly. That's the whole philosophy of Life in English,

122
00:12:38.910 --> 00:12:42.610
To be honest with you, man, is just understanding that you can do a bunch of stuff.

123
00:12:42.690 --> 00:12:47.670
Everyone watches videos or grammar lessons. Everybody tries the courses in the schools.

124
00:12:47.740 --> 00:12:52.110
But the most effective thing is doing what you did the first time you had to learn a language, man.

125
00:12:52.110 --> 00:12:58.240
Just speak to real people. Listen to real people all day, every day. And even if it's never perfect.

126
00:12:59.430 --> 00:13:02.460
It's... It just gets really good over time because you're doing it all the time.

127
00:13:03.730 --> 00:13:05.280
All the time, you know? That's it.

128
00:13:05.540 --> 00:13:09.240
Guilherme:
Yeah. And it's like you learn your native language.

129
00:13:09.470 --> 00:13:09.590
Tony Kaizen:
Yeah.

130
00:13:10.080 --> 00:13:14.700
Guilherme:
You listen and speak, listen a lot, and speak a little.

131
00:13:15.110 --> 00:13:20.570
And more speak, speak, speak over the time. Right? I like the...

132
00:13:21.090 --> 00:13:27.830
I don't like English traditional standards lessons. And it's not for me.

133
00:13:29.130 --> 00:13:41.910
I think that's the why, that's why I never go to school or never study... liked study and English books.

134
00:13:42.130 --> 00:13:48.460
It's I... It's not, how to say that?

135
00:13:50.210 --> 00:13:55.270
That's expre... There's expression in Portuguese is "entra na minha cabeça".

136
00:13:56.160 --> 00:13:57.340
Tony Kaizen:
Entra na minha cabeça?

137
00:13:57.800 --> 00:14:03.720
Guilherme:
Yeah, it's expression is... It means you memorize that.

138
00:14:04.330 --> 00:14:05.670
Tony Kaizen:
Ahh, okay.

139
00:14:05.920 --> 00:14:15.590
Guilherme:
You... Entra na minha cabeça is you memorize. Okay? Books I don't memorize.

140
00:14:18.040 --> 00:14:25.080
I see a word, two days I forgot. That's it.

141
00:14:29.380 --> 00:14:38.920
Oh, I think it looks like rain. If I disappear, my internet follows off. Okay?

142
00:14:39.020 --> 00:14:41.090
Tony Kaizen:
Oh yeah. I was trying to figure out what you mean 'rain'.

143
00:14:41.090 --> 00:14:46.000
But now I get it. Because, yeah, once it starts raining, the connection sometimes is not so good.

144
00:14:47.070 --> 00:14:55.110
Guilherme:
Yeah. I don't know if it's the same in U.S. Brazil, it's rain the internet is over.

145
00:14:57.650 --> 00:15:04.210
Brazil, it's rain. Internet...

146
00:15:05.090 --> 00:15:06.980
Tony Kaizen:
No more internet. Bye-bye internet.

147
00:15:06.980 --> 00:15:07.160
Guilherme:
Yeah.

148
00:15:07.320 --> 00:15:07.920
Tony Kaizen:
Yeah, yeah.

149
00:15:08.260 --> 00:15:11.600
Guilherme:
Bye-bye internet. I don't know if it's the same in U.S, but in Brazil...

150
00:15:11.600 --> 00:15:16.150
Tony Kaizen:
I mean, maybe in some places, like where it's in rural areas like the country and stuff.

151
00:15:16.220 --> 00:15:20.190
But nah, in most cities like here, when it rains, usually we're good.

152
00:15:20.290 --> 00:15:23.710
If it's a bad storm, then maybe. But nah, usually we're good.

153
00:15:23.710 --> 00:15:26.960
But I've had that experience, man, when I was in Brazil a couple of years ago,

154
00:15:26.960 --> 00:15:30.050
Whenever it would rain, it was just... It was bad.

155
00:15:30.270 --> 00:15:31.220
Guilherme:
You have been in Brazil?

156
00:15:31.950 --> 00:15:37.350
Tony Kaizen:
Yeah, yeah. I went in 2019. I spent a couple of months there.

157
00:15:37.350 --> 00:15:38.490
Guilherme:
Oh! Do you like it?

158
00:15:38.800 --> 00:15:41.370
Tony Kaizen:
I love it, man. I can't wait to go back, to be honest with you.

159
00:15:41.440 --> 00:15:46.520
I spent two months in Sao Paulo and like two weeks in Salvador.

160
00:15:47.910 --> 00:15:56.700
Guilherme:
Oh Sao Paulo, it's closer to me, in the same state. I'm in the city of the state of Sao Paulo.

161
00:15:57.840 --> 00:15:58.840
Tony Kaizen:
Mogi das Cruzes, right?

162
00:15:59.550 --> 00:16:06.250
Guilherme:
Yeah. Yeah. Mogi das Cruzes. And it's... I love this place.

163
00:16:06.490 --> 00:16:12.640
Mogi das Cruzes, not Brazil. My city, not my country. My country is...

164
00:16:13.980 --> 00:16:24.380
I like Brazil, like people, but institutions. Instituições. Institutions?

165
00:16:24.380 --> 00:16:25.760
Tony Kaizen:
Institutions, yeah.

166
00:16:26.490 --> 00:16:32.850
Guilherme:
Institutions are so bad, man. So bad.

167
00:16:34.110 --> 00:16:42.860
My wife and me we want to move to Canada, Toronto, or Vancouver.

168
00:16:44.320 --> 00:16:57.730
Something like that. But I don't know. It's Canada, it seems like U.S but with public health care,

169
00:16:57.730 --> 00:17:06.990
I don't know, something like that. But I like U.S.

170
00:17:07.120 --> 00:17:12.310
I like U.S. But I don't like that there's no public health care.

171
00:17:12.310 --> 00:17:21.020
You have SUS. It's you have... If you have cancer, can you treat?

172
00:17:21.600 --> 00:17:28.950
And and there's, if you don't have money and if you have cancer, you're okay.

173
00:17:30.890 --> 00:17:30.950
Tony Kaizen:
Yeah.

174
00:17:31.100 --> 00:17:42.430
Guilherme:
So if I have cancer in the future, I don't know. And that's why I prefer, I'd rather Canada.

175
00:17:42.910 --> 00:17:45.400
Tony Kaizen:
I'd rather Canada. Yeah. I mean, that's a good reason, man.

176
00:17:45.400 --> 00:17:49.600
Health care is extremely important, and we do a lot of things great in this country.

177
00:17:49.600 --> 00:17:51.890
Health care is not one of them. That's for sure.

178
00:17:52.200 --> 00:17:54.700
Oh we have, like, quality health care. It's just you have to pay,

179
00:17:54.700 --> 00:17:58.900
You have to sell your mother just to get it. You know what I'm saying? So...

180
00:17:59.180 --> 00:18:08.060
Guilherme:
Yeah. Yeah. I saw something like that in Reddit. Reddit it's very popular in U.S.

181
00:18:08.060 --> 00:18:23.720
And Brazil no one knows Reddit. And so I saw a case of a woman who has Covid, I don't remember exactly.

182
00:18:24.070 --> 00:18:32.240
But something simple in, something in Brazil is for free.

183
00:18:33.110 --> 00:18:42.560
And in U.S. shipping a $400, $300, something like that it's okay.

184
00:18:42.920 --> 00:18:46.290
But most of Brazilians that... I'll be honest with you,

185
00:18:46.290 --> 00:18:56.260
A most of Brazilian want to move to the United States just for buy iPhones, just for this.

186
00:18:56.620 --> 00:19:06.570
Because iPhone is so expensive in Brazil. Something like 15 mil reais is like...

187
00:19:07.150 --> 00:19:09.820
Tony Kaizen:
Jesus Christ! 15 thousand reais?

188
00:19:11.150 --> 00:19:17.520
Guilherme:
Yes, 15 thousand. It's like insane. It's insane.

189
00:19:17.670 --> 00:19:24.670
So the people want to move to U.S to buy iPhone, Tesla, or something like that.

190
00:19:26.510 --> 00:19:33.020
Just because that the the the safe, the security, the...

191
00:19:34.040 --> 00:19:44.020
It's not the main goal. The main goal is buy iPhones. And...

192
00:19:44.430 --> 00:19:52.310
Tony Kaizen:
Buy iPhones. Oh, shit. R$15,000, that's like $2,700.

193
00:19:52.310 --> 00:19:55.380
That's fucking insane. That is insane.

194
00:19:55.560 --> 00:20:06.500
Guilherme:
It's the.. Insane. And if you convert the real to dollar. That's insane.

195
00:20:06.760 --> 00:20:08.490
Tony Kaizen:
That's what I'm saying. Yeah, man. It's crazy.

196
00:20:09.410 --> 00:20:16.250
Guilherme:
In real, in reais it's more insane because the salário mínimo. The minimum...

197
00:20:16.370 --> 00:20:17.290
Tony Kaizen:
The minimum wage.

198
00:20:18.160 --> 00:20:22.540
Guilherme:
Minimum wage is, I don't know, R$1,000.

199
00:20:22.540 --> 00:20:26.150
Tony Kaizen:
Maybe less, right? Isn't like 900 or something?

200
00:20:26.250 --> 00:20:26.690
Guilherme:
Maybe less. Yeah.

201
00:20:26.690 --> 00:20:27.870
Tony Kaizen:
Something ridiculous like that. Yeah.

202
00:20:28.740 --> 00:20:36.700
Guilherme:
Yeah. So if you want to buy iPhone, it's... Have to work years.

203
00:20:37.730 --> 00:20:41.480
Tony Kaizen:
Literally, man. Literally had to work years for that shit. Yeah.

204
00:20:42.060 --> 00:20:50.840
Guilherme:
Yeah, yeah. So, and this is, like I said, it's a good place.

205
00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:59.980
It's a good country, but shit like that. People just go off. Fuck.

206
00:21:01.720 --> 00:21:07.040
Bye Bye. I'm just moving to Portugal, U.S, Canada, Europe, or something.

207
00:21:07.560 --> 00:21:08.770
Somewhere, aliás (<-- this is a Portuguese word).

208
00:21:10.680 --> 00:21:14.370
Tony Kaizen:
But is it, was that your main motivation for learning English in the first place,

209
00:21:14.370 --> 00:21:17.640
Or your whole motivation was just trying to understand the movies

210
00:21:17.640 --> 00:21:21.560
And songs you had been listening to since you were a kid?

211
00:21:21.800 --> 00:21:26.260
Guilherme:
Basically, like I said, I'm a video marketing editor.

212
00:21:26.330 --> 00:21:26.610
Tony Kaizen:
Yes.

213
00:21:27.240 --> 00:21:39.440
Guilherme:
So and I work from home I can work for anyone, from anywhere because of English.

214
00:21:41.680 --> 00:21:52.370
It's I can't work from Brazil. But $5... R$5 is $1, right?

215
00:21:54.330 --> 00:22:09.840
And I am searching, I'm searching and the price of the videos is $100, for example. I, eu cobro...

216
00:22:11.070 --> 00:22:11.540
Tony Kaizen:
I charge.

217
00:22:11.660 --> 00:22:16.010
Guilherme:
I charge R$100 for a video.

218
00:22:16.010 --> 00:22:16.480
Tony Kaizen:
Oh, Jesus.

219
00:22:17.410 --> 00:22:32.940
Guilherme:
If I charge $100, I will earn R$500 for the same job. The same job.

220
00:22:35.770 --> 00:22:47.280
So it's for basically, it's to understand movies, understand raps and work from the world.

221
00:22:48.860 --> 00:22:53.260
All the world, all the world are my customers.

222
00:22:53.970 --> 00:23:01.670
Tony Kaizen:
When you say 'work the world' you mean work with the world in terms of doing business and things like that?

223
00:23:02.820 --> 00:23:09.380
Guilherme:
Yeah. Is something like. Oh, do you need a video? I make videos.

224
00:23:09.900 --> 00:23:11.870
Tony Kaizen:
Yeah. Yeah. So work with the world. Exactly.

225
00:23:11.870 --> 00:23:15.900
Not just with Brazilians, but people all over the world, right?

226
00:23:16.080 --> 00:23:16.830
Guilherme:
Yep. Yeah.

227
00:23:16.830 --> 00:23:20.720
Tony Kaizen:
And from anywhere in the world. Because like you said, you can do your job in any country.

228
00:23:20.720 --> 00:23:22.650
You just need your computer and the internet.

229
00:23:22.900 --> 00:23:26.360
Guilherme:
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Basically, this is it.

230
00:23:26.630 --> 00:23:33.350
I need a computer, internet and that's it. I can make my job. So...

231
00:23:34.110 --> 00:23:34.800
Tony Kaizen:
I can do my job.

232
00:23:35.550 --> 00:23:45.070
Guilherme:
I can do. I can do my job. I can do my job. So... I think that's my main goal.

233
00:23:45.090 --> 00:23:48.040
Tony Kaizen:
I gotcha.

234
00:23:48.040 --> 00:23:55.130
Guilherme:
Just work from anyone. All over the world.

235
00:23:57.510 --> 00:24:00.520
Tony Kaizen:
It's a good way to think about it, man.

236
00:24:00.520 --> 00:24:02.300
Guilherme:
Yeah and make more money.

237
00:24:03.320 --> 00:24:08.280
Tony Kaizen:
Absolutely. That's always good. So, that's always good. But like you said, man,

238
00:24:08.280 --> 00:24:14.980
Something so simple as learning another language like English opens so many doors that you never thought possible

239
00:24:15.170 --> 00:24:23.610
Cause you can, like you said, do the same job just with different clients that can and will pay you more for the same job. You know?

240
00:24:23.750 --> 00:24:29.830
Guilherme:
Yeah. Yeah. I have a friend, she's a motion designer.

241
00:24:29.900 --> 00:24:33.910
I don't know if English is the same word. Motion designer?

242
00:24:34.620 --> 00:24:36.270
Tony Kaizen:
Like motion graphics and stuff like that.

243
00:24:36.620 --> 00:24:45.610
Guilherme:
Yeah, exactly. And she's, she's, she's have my... I don't know if it's right,

244
00:24:45.610 --> 00:24:52.780
But my level, my English level. Okay? And she understand a lot, but she's not speak.

245
00:24:53.760 --> 00:25:08.210
And she... how to say that? She paid for a teacher for speaking, talking, something like we are no know now.

246
00:25:08.370 --> 00:25:08.580
Tony Kaizen:
Sure.

247
00:25:09.860 --> 00:25:19.580
Guilherme:
And now she's only work from people outside from Brazil. Out of Brazil.

248
00:25:19.790 --> 00:25:20.690
I don't know how to...

249
00:25:20.690 --> 00:25:21.600
Tony Kaizen:
Outside of Brazil.

250
00:25:22.250 --> 00:25:30.150
Guilherme:
Outside of Brazil. And she's making, she's earning a lot of money.

251
00:25:30.360 --> 00:25:42.170
Not a lot of money, but more money because how I said, the same job for another or other,

252
00:25:42.250 --> 00:25:51.850
Another country is paying more for us because I...

253
00:25:52.300 --> 00:26:02.890
So when I, when she told me that, I think, Okay, that's what I need.

254
00:26:07.190 --> 00:26:20.790
And I just, I started, I think this is the word, I started of searching about teachers,

255
00:26:20.870 --> 00:26:29.940
English teachers, and I found your TikTok. I said, Okay,

256
00:26:31.830 --> 00:26:44.260
He's explain, I understand what he's saying and he... how do I say?

257
00:26:44.790 --> 00:26:56.190
He speaks, he speaks in the way... de uma forma que eu gosto. In the way of I like.

258
00:26:56.190 --> 00:26:57.530
Tony Kaizen:
In a way I like. Yeah.

259
00:26:57.990 --> 00:27:02.920
Guilherme:
In a way I like. So.. And he's a black man too. It's very important.

260
00:27:04.080 --> 00:27:13.060
So I say, okay, okay, I like. And I follow you on TikTok. And like I said yesterday, I...

261
00:27:15.540 --> 00:27:20.070
You said about Life in English, and I just joined the community.

262
00:27:22.360 --> 00:27:28.630
Tony Kaizen:
Wow, man, that's awesome. It's such a great story to go from knowing absolutely nothing.

263
00:27:29.160 --> 00:27:31.820
Then just over a year, a year and a half by yourself,

264
00:27:32.350 --> 00:27:35.760
Just by being interested and doing it every day, by watching movies,

265
00:27:35.760 --> 00:27:38.100
Listening to music, reading things, writing, etc.

266
00:27:38.950 --> 00:27:41.400
And then now you've got to this point where you're speaking.

267
00:27:42.350 --> 00:27:47.080
And you did it all basically by yourself, man. That was crazy. It's really impressive.

268
00:27:47.150 --> 00:27:51.570
But my question to you is, why did you not do the same thing your friend did?

269
00:27:51.620 --> 00:27:55.610
Because you said she found a private teacher to practice with on a regular basis.

270
00:27:55.610 --> 00:27:58.620
So what made it or how can I say,

271
00:27:59.240 --> 00:28:04.200
Why was the idea of joining a community more interesting than the idea of just finding a private teacher?

272
00:28:07.710 --> 00:28:14.510
Guilherme:
How to answer that.. The idea of community is so nice to me.

273
00:28:16.260 --> 00:28:20.200
A bunch of people. A lot of people, I don't know. A bunch of people is right?

274
00:28:20.590 --> 00:28:21.670
Tony Kaizen:
Yeah, sure. Same thing.

275
00:28:23.290 --> 00:28:34.390
Guilherme:
A bunch of people and speaking, talking. And this is where... It's nice, you know?

276
00:28:34.560 --> 00:28:50.670
And okay, I could just talk to her. She knows English. And more or less it's mais ou menos.

277
00:28:50.700 --> 00:29:06.090
More or less. It's... And I could just speak with her. But commu... Community is so hard.

278
00:29:06.380 --> 00:29:13.540
Community. Community is, it's nice. It's... don't know how to say that.

279
00:29:15.300 --> 00:29:21.770
I... we are social animals. I don't know it's English is the same.

280
00:29:21.770 --> 00:29:23.040
Tony Kaizen:
Yep. Same thing. Same thing.

281
00:29:23.240 --> 00:29:26.030
Guilherme:
Same thing? We are social animals.

282
00:29:26.080 --> 00:29:35.180
So and I like the people in the same place talking about the same thing.

283
00:29:35.690 --> 00:29:45.760
Like a church, I don't know. A lot of people in the same place talking about the same thing.

284
00:29:46.590 --> 00:29:54.640
And I think is you learn more that way. I don't know.

285
00:29:55.110 --> 00:30:04.880
It's for me is, it's more the English environment. Environment. I think that's the word.

286
00:30:04.950 --> 00:30:05.030
Tony Kaizen:
Yeah.

287
00:30:05.030 --> 00:30:10.710
Guilherme:
The English environment. Em inglês é, o ambiente do Inglês in Portuguese,

288
00:30:10.710 --> 00:30:19.850
But in English I think is the English environment. And it's more time in English.

289
00:30:19.960 --> 00:30:29.760
It's.. And more time in English, more people in English and people, I don't know, you are in U.S.

290
00:30:29.760 --> 00:30:39.740
You.. All the world and look at U.S, United States.

291
00:30:40.380 --> 00:30:47.450
So you have... how to say 'alunos' in Port... in English? I don't know.

292
00:30:47.450 --> 00:30:48.640
Tony Kaizen:
Students. Students.

293
00:30:48.750 --> 00:30:55.550
Guilherme:
Students. Student. Estudantes. Okay. Students all over the world.

294
00:30:55.660 --> 00:31:05.820
You could have students all over the world and I like that. I like it.

295
00:31:06.390 --> 00:31:14.930
I don't know if it's possible to talk about people from England or England,

296
00:31:14.930 --> 00:31:21.250
No... English (people).. To speak English. But like, I don't know.

297
00:31:21.520 --> 00:31:31.100
China and Russia. Every. Venezuela. Colombia. I don't know.

298
00:31:32.200 --> 00:31:38.930
I like this kind of feeling. I think that's the word.

299
00:31:41.070 --> 00:31:46.940
Type of feeling and to speak people all over the world.

300
00:31:47.430 --> 00:31:53.990
Differents, I don't know, lifes experience. Experience of lifes.

301
00:31:54.180 --> 00:31:55.930
Tony Kaizen:
Different life experiences.

302
00:31:56.360 --> 00:32:01.970
Guilherme:
Different life experiences. Thank you. This is perfect to me.

303
00:32:04.750 --> 00:32:07.110
Or perfect for me. I don't know how to say.

304
00:32:07.190 --> 00:32:10.300
Tony Kaizen:
You know what's funny, man, is I was just thinking to myself, which one sounds better?

305
00:32:10.330 --> 00:32:14.200
And I would say, This is perfect... Both of them make sense in this case.

306
00:32:14.200 --> 00:32:17.980
But naturally, I would say "for me". This is perfect for me.

307
00:32:18.240 --> 00:32:23.840
Guilherme:
Perfect for... It's perfect, it's... Words you have C and T.

308
00:32:25.270 --> 00:32:28.970
You, you don't say T. Just perfect.

309
00:32:29.300 --> 00:32:33.070
Tony Kaizen:
Perfect. I say the T. It's just very, very, very soft. And you don't...

310
00:32:33.390 --> 00:32:35.710
To be honest with you, you don't have to pronounce that T

311
00:32:35.760 --> 00:32:39.680
Because many people don't when they're speaking fast, but just naturally perfect.

312
00:32:40.270 --> 00:32:42.320
There's a soft T at the end there.

313
00:32:43.150 --> 00:32:43.530
Guilherme:
Perfect.

314
00:32:43.880 --> 00:32:45.980
Tony Kaizen:
There you go. That was perfect.

315
00:32:45.980 --> 00:32:56.640
Guilherme:
Okay. This different of fact. Fact, fact have a T. But you don't say T. Right?

316
00:32:56.640 --> 00:32:58.170
Tony Kaizen:
Yeah. That's a fact. Yeah.

317
00:32:58.310 --> 00:33:07.530
Guilherme:
Fact. Okay. Okay. This is... It's like the word, and I don't,

318
00:33:07.650 --> 00:33:14.390
I don't know if you know the Hamilton as Lin-Manuel Miranda. You know?

319
00:33:16.340 --> 00:33:17.710
Tony Kaizen:
No. It's a person?

320
00:33:17.710 --> 00:33:28.180
Guilherme:
Oh, no? No, Hamilton is a Broadway show. It's amazing, man. Okay. I will send a link of Hamilton.

321
00:33:28.220 --> 00:33:31.550
Tony Kaizen:
Hey, please do. Please do. You sound very passionate about this.

322
00:33:32.150 --> 00:33:34.640
Guilherme:
Oh, it's amazing. You like rap, right?

323
00:33:34.830 --> 00:33:35.960
Tony Kaizen:
I love rap. Hell yeah.

324
00:33:36.160 --> 00:33:44.030
Guilherme:
Okay. It's like a rap concert about the life of Alexander Hamilton, the founding father.

325
00:33:44.180 --> 00:33:45.060
Tony Kaizen:
Yeah. Yeah. Okay.

326
00:33:45.130 --> 00:33:46.750
Guilherme:
It's amazing. I send you a link.

327
00:33:47.300 --> 00:33:48.750
Tony Kaizen:
Please do.

328
00:33:48.980 --> 00:33:57.850
Guilherme:
It's amazing. So in Hamilton, they said the word "debt". D E B T.

329
00:33:58.050 --> 00:33:58.170
Tony Kaizen:
Yeah.

330
00:33:58.820 --> 00:34:08.760
Guilherme:
And for a long time, I thought this debt. And so, no, it's not. It's debt.

331
00:34:09.100 --> 00:34:18.850
Debt like debt, fact. So okay they know they don't pronounce some letters and that's it.

332
00:34:20.270 --> 00:34:34.070
So fact, debt and perfect, that's words and consonants I think that's the part the word.

333
00:34:34.120 --> 00:34:34.240
Tony Kaizen:
Yeah.

334
00:34:34.560 --> 00:34:50.230
Guilherme:
Consonants and C, T is each one is pronounced.. it's pronouncing in one way.

335
00:34:50.500 --> 00:34:55.030
De uma forma. This is a different way. I don't know if it's right.

336
00:34:55.030 --> 00:34:56.770
Tony Kaizen:
Yeah. In a particular way, you can say.

337
00:34:56.890 --> 00:35:00.850
Guilherme:
In a particular way. It's.. Yeah, okay. In a particular way.

338
00:35:01.470 --> 00:35:11.120
So it's hard for me, for Brazilian people. If you have... here's example.

339
00:35:11.350 --> 00:35:27.200
Here's an example. Found. O U N. FOUND. But country is O U N, but it's not country. Okay?

340
00:35:27.870 --> 00:35:36.440
So in Portuguese, if you (have) O U N in any word it's OU. Any word.

341
00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:47.560
O U O. Like 'louco' and crazy. And so that's the difficult part of English for me.

342
00:35:47.940 --> 00:35:49.370
Tony Kaizen:
And you want to know what is crazy, man,

343
00:35:49.480 --> 00:35:53.970
Is just with that specific example O U N in 'found' it's an OUN.

344
00:35:54.500 --> 00:36:01.820
The O U N in 'country' is AN, country. And that's C O U N T R Y.

345
00:36:02.310 --> 00:36:03.680
Now, I'm going to give you another word,

346
00:36:03.720 --> 00:36:07.890
And I want you to tell me how you think you would pronounce this word. COUNTY.

347
00:36:12.090 --> 00:36:13.320
Guilherme:
Repeat, please.

348
00:36:13.450 --> 00:36:17.560
Tony Kaizen:
C O U N T Y.

349
00:36:20.240 --> 00:36:22.760
Guilherme:
It's dounty?

350
00:36:23.370 --> 00:36:29.170
Tony Kaizen:
No, C. C O U N T Y. Just like 'country' but with no R. Take the R out of 'country'.

351
00:36:29.310 --> 00:36:32.200
Guilherme:
Ahh. I don't know... I know this word, it's county.

352
00:36:32.380 --> 00:36:32.850
Tony Kaizen:
County.

353
00:36:34.360 --> 00:36:38.380
Guilherme:
I know this word. It's in Portuguese, it's like Condado. It's county.

354
00:36:38.440 --> 00:36:42.380
Tony Kaizen:
Exactly, exactly. But the point is, you just take the R out of country

355
00:36:42.430 --> 00:36:46.940
And the word makes a completely different sound, man. It makes no sense. It makes no sense.

356
00:36:46.940 --> 00:36:49.730
Guilherme:
Yeah, yeah. County. Country. Found.

357
00:36:50.280 --> 00:36:50.450
Tony Kaizen:
Yeah.

358
00:36:51.190 --> 00:36:56.230
Guilherme:
It's, it's just drop the R and in different pronounce.

359
00:36:56.230 --> 00:37:00.500
Tony Kaizen:
It's OUN instead of AN. Yeah, it's weird. It's weird.

360
00:37:00.500 --> 00:37:01.310
Guilherme:
Why? Why?

361
00:37:01.430 --> 00:37:05.070
Tony Kaizen:
This is fucking English, man. Yeah, it's, there's like a whole history behind it, of course.

362
00:37:05.120 --> 00:37:10.440
But this... which you have to come to accept at some point during the process of learning English is just like,

363
00:37:11.090 --> 00:37:13.990
Some things don't make sense, man, and you just have to accept.

364
00:37:14.250 --> 00:37:18.730
That's just the way it is. Don't even ask questions. Just that's the way it is, you know?

365
00:37:19.390 --> 00:37:31.980
Guilherme:
So but here's a question. If you native speakers in the United States see the word, you know how to pronounce? Or...

366
00:37:32.050 --> 00:37:38.780
Tony Kaizen:
Yes. Well, those specific words. Those specific like, county and country, we just know that one is pronounced...

367
00:37:39.210 --> 00:37:44.460
Guilherme:
I say a new word. A word you never saw. A new word.

368
00:37:44.460 --> 00:37:45.530
Tony Kaizen:
A word I've never seen before.

369
00:37:45.530 --> 00:37:57.980
Guilherme:
You look and... Yeah, you look and just know how to pronounce or somethings some people pronounce the wrong way?

370
00:37:59.390 --> 00:38:02.790
Tony Kaizen:
No, it depends on the word. But yeah, it's a normal thing,

371
00:38:02.920 --> 00:38:09.900
A common thing for us to see a new word and have no idea how to pronounce it. That's normal.

372
00:38:10.090 --> 00:38:10.220
Guilherme:
Okay.

373
00:38:10.220 --> 00:38:10.280
Tony Kaizen:
Yeah.

374
00:38:10.280 --> 00:38:10.430
Guilherme:
Okay.

375
00:38:10.830 --> 00:38:15.790
Tony Kaizen:
That's totally normal. Or like, we hear a word and we have no idea how to spell it, you know?

376
00:38:15.860 --> 00:38:19.650
It's totally normal. Because you can spell it multiple ways in English.

377
00:38:20.440 --> 00:38:30.960
Guilherme:
It's like throughout. It's like, okay. The first time I listened 'throughout' I...

378
00:38:32.750 --> 00:38:43.980
How to spell? And when I, when I saw the word written. Written, I think there's the word.

379
00:38:44.290 --> 00:38:44.840
Tony Kaizen:
Written, yeah.

380
00:38:45.960 --> 00:38:51.590
Guilherme:
Written. I said okay, that's weird. Really weird.

381
00:38:52.220 --> 00:38:52.470
Tony Kaizen:
Yeah, man.

382
00:38:52.470 --> 00:39:10.280
Guilherme:
It's weird because throughout it's... I thought, T H R O U T? And no. And it's...

383
00:39:11.770 --> 00:39:20.110
You have the, the seems words. I don't know if it's... palavras parecidas. Seems words, I think.

384
00:39:20.110 --> 00:39:21.690
Tony Kaizen:
Oh, similar words. Similar words.

385
00:39:21.690 --> 00:39:32.600
Guilherme:
Similar words, like throughout, thought, tough and I don't know, through. It's...

386
00:39:34.760 --> 00:39:45.750
Now I see the word I know. But for a long time for me it's the same word.

387
00:39:46.210 --> 00:39:59.040
Through, throughout, tough. Okay. But you, like you said, it's just again and again and again you will learn it.

388
00:40:00.680 --> 00:40:02.470
Tony Kaizen:
That's it, man. That's really it.

389
00:40:02.470 --> 00:40:08.750
So it's actually really cool to hear from somebody that considers themselves a lower intermediate speaker

390
00:40:08.750 --> 00:40:14.670
And has been learning by themselves from the beginning just basically express so clearly from your own experience,

391
00:40:14.670 --> 00:40:18.990
You understand the simple philosophy of if you want to learn the language,

392
00:40:19.040 --> 00:40:22.050
Just live your life in that language every single day.

393
00:40:22.200 --> 00:40:24.710
It's there's nothing else you need to do. You know?

394
00:40:24.710 --> 00:40:26.480
Of course, some people will learn in different ways.

395
00:40:26.480 --> 00:40:29.020
Some people prefer to read or write more or whatever.

396
00:40:29.020 --> 00:40:32.380
But if you want to learn how to speak or have conversations,

397
00:40:32.380 --> 00:40:34.940
You just have to speak and have conversations, man.

398
00:40:34.940 --> 00:40:39.800
So I'm very impressed and even proud of you, man.

399
00:40:39.870 --> 00:40:42.910
And like the progress that you've made, like by yourself, just...

400
00:40:43.210 --> 00:40:43.600
Guilherme:
Thank you!

401
00:40:43.630 --> 00:40:45.010
Tony Kaizen:
Learning at home alone. It's cool, man.

402
00:40:45.010 --> 00:40:49.340
Because I went through the same exact process when I learned your first language, you know?

403
00:40:49.340 --> 00:40:52.210
So it's cool to see somebody else doing it themselves, you know?

404
00:40:53.510 --> 00:41:00.480
Guilherme:
You... Okay, you speak Portuguese, but I don't know how to say that. I considering me?

405
00:41:00.750 --> 00:41:07.440
In Portuguese, eu me considero. But in English I consider me a lower...

406
00:41:07.640 --> 00:41:10.240
Tony Kaizen:
I consider myself. Myself.

407
00:41:10.590 --> 00:41:18.450
Guilherme:
Okay. The first word is right, second word is wrong. I consider myself a lower intermediate.

408
00:41:19.080 --> 00:41:29.420
And but I don't know how... It's difficult to me because listen, okay, I listen and...

409
00:41:30.130 --> 00:41:34.780
Skills of English. Oh better, English skills.

410
00:41:35.160 --> 00:41:46.580
Listen, I consider myself an upper intermediate because I listen, I understand but I...

411
00:41:46.580 --> 00:41:55.700
Eu coloquei é put. I put, I put a lower intermediate because of speaking, because of writing.

412
00:41:56.650 --> 00:42:01.160
And I think it is more appropriate to me.

413
00:42:01.160 --> 00:42:01.590
Tony Kaizen:
Appropriate.

414
00:42:03.980 --> 00:42:05.660
Guilherme:
Repeat, please. Appropriate.

415
00:42:06.430 --> 00:42:07.340
Tony Kaizen:
Appropriate.

416
00:42:08.990 --> 00:42:09.680
Guilherme:
Appropriate.

417
00:42:09.970 --> 00:42:15.410
Tony Kaizen:
There you go. Appropriate. And it's like I know it's spelled A T E, so you think ATE.

418
00:42:15.540 --> 00:42:19.950
But when we're speaking naturally, it sounds more like IT. Appropriate. You see?

419
00:42:20.900 --> 00:42:24.380
Guilherme:
Appropriate. Apro... That's no ATE. It's IT.

420
00:42:24.380 --> 00:42:26.160
Tony Kaizen:
It's more like IT. Exactly. Exactly.

421
00:42:26.830 --> 00:42:27.530
Guilherme:
Appropriate.

422
00:42:27.690 --> 00:42:31.250
Tony Kaizen:
There you go. Appropriate. Priate. Appropriate.

423
00:42:31.330 --> 00:42:40.110
Guilherme:
It's strange for me. The the is is is when words, cognate words?

424
00:42:40.560 --> 00:42:43.330
Palavras cognatas? I don't know how to say that.

425
00:42:43.580 --> 00:42:44.130
Tony Kaizen:
Cognate words.

426
00:42:44.130 --> 00:42:53.910
Guilherme:
Cognate words is apropriado, appropriate it's difficult to me. But... I forgot what I am saying.

427
00:42:53.960 --> 00:42:58.900
Tony Kaizen:
You were saying that you put a lower level for speaking because it's more appropriate. Right?

428
00:42:59.080 --> 00:43:11.600
Guilherme:
Yeah. Yeah. You are a lower intermediate in Portuguese or upper or advanced level or something like that?

429
00:43:12.560 --> 00:43:13.640
Tony Kaizen:
You're asking me my level?

430
00:43:14.710 --> 00:43:18.630
Guilherme:
Yeah, in Portuguese you're advanced or... I think.

431
00:43:20.140 --> 00:43:24.600
Tony Kaizen:
Well, I consider myself like an upper intermediate speaker and an advanced listener.

432
00:43:25.570 --> 00:43:36.250
Guilherme:
Yeah. Oh, that's you, you and you learn in the same way.

433
00:43:36.580 --> 00:43:41.560
Tony Kaizen:
Literally. I can tell you very quickly all I did to learn your language.

434
00:43:41.620 --> 00:43:48.980
It was very, very, very simple. I started with Duolingo because that was the only app or technology I knew at the time.

435
00:43:48.980 --> 00:43:52.280
And I just wanted to learn a bunch of simple words as fast as possible.

436
00:43:52.660 --> 00:43:55.540
So I would use Duolingo for maybe an hour or an hour and a half.

437
00:43:55.540 --> 00:43:58.400
It was super boring, but I learned a bunch of basic words.

438
00:43:58.770 --> 00:44:05.350
Then immediately in less than a month I went on Hello Talk and I started sending messages to people,

439
00:44:05.490 --> 00:44:09.110
Looking for people to talk to. I found some really cool people, one or two,

440
00:44:09.470 --> 00:44:16.540
And I would talk to them every single day. Every day we would send text messages, voice messages.

441
00:44:16.590 --> 00:44:20.000
We would talk on the phone. We would talk on Skype. But every day.

442
00:44:20.730 --> 00:44:24.160
Sometimes I would talk for three or 4 hours with one of them. You see what I'm saying?

443
00:44:24.160 --> 00:44:30.360
And this was like every day for a year or two years. And then I made some more friends.

444
00:44:30.360 --> 00:44:32.930
I talked to hundreds of Brazilians and I started teaching English.

445
00:44:33.350 --> 00:44:35.860
So I just met a bunch of Brazilians over two or three years,

446
00:44:36.480 --> 00:44:40.100
And I was always talking to people in Portuguese, thinking in Portuguese,

447
00:44:40.100 --> 00:44:42.990
Listening to music in Portuguese. I would watch the classic movies.

448
00:44:43.030 --> 00:44:46.050
But every day I was talking. Every single day.

449
00:44:46.270 --> 00:44:48.380
So that means every day I was having conversations,

450
00:44:48.380 --> 00:44:52.400
Like having to improvise and hear different accents, learn a bunch of new slang.

451
00:44:52.400 --> 00:44:57.480
But in real time, in real life. So I never studied. I hate studying grammar and,

452
00:44:57.480 --> 00:45:01.460
Like, speaking exercises and I'm not going to remember that stuff. It's boring.

453
00:45:02.170 --> 00:45:06.400
We use language to talk to people and I like to talk to people. So that's what I did.

454
00:45:07.530 --> 00:45:14.240
Guilherme:
Yeah. Oh, you listen to music but rap music, brazilian rap music?

455
00:45:14.270 --> 00:45:18.310
Tony Kaizen:
Racionais, MV Bill, Criolo... you know?

456
00:45:18.700 --> 00:45:20.830
A bunch of them. Yeah. Rael. There's a bunch of different artists.

457
00:45:21.540 --> 00:45:24.730
Guilherme:
How do you understand the slang? And the... Because...

458
00:45:25.120 --> 00:45:27.470
Tony Kaizen:
And that's exactly how, man, making Brazilian friends.

459
00:45:27.510 --> 00:45:31.350
So some of my friends love hip-hop music. Brazilian hip hop music.

460
00:45:31.350 --> 00:45:34.250
So they would send me music, they would send me different artists

461
00:45:34.250 --> 00:45:38.150
And I would read the song lyrics and I'd ask them questions or we'd get on Skype

462
00:45:38.460 --> 00:45:42.690
And they would explain line by line what these things mean, what the slang is,

463
00:45:43.110 --> 00:45:45.840
What city they're from, and stuff like that. You see what I'm saying?

464
00:45:45.840 --> 00:45:48.580
So I had real people explaining the real language to me.

465
00:45:49.940 --> 00:46:05.310
Guilherme:
Oh, okay. Explain and it's... It's amazing. See, because I, I don't know how to say in English.

466
00:46:05.610 --> 00:46:12.820
Em Português, in Portuguese you say Português, but in English is Portuguese, like...

467
00:46:12.820 --> 00:46:13.480
Tony Kaizen:
Yeah. Portuguese.

468
00:46:14.820 --> 00:46:27.150
Guilherme:
So and... In Portuguese we say "Eu sou viciado em alguma coisa". How to say this in English?

469
00:46:28.250 --> 00:46:30.660
Tony Kaizen:
I would say I'm addicted to something.

470
00:46:31.630 --> 00:46:44.570
Guilherme:
Ohh okay, but it's like... Okay, listen, in Portuguese, you say Eu sou viciado em rap.

471
00:46:46.720 --> 00:46:54.490
You don't say... okay. You don't say "We are addict of rap". Of rap.

472
00:46:54.520 --> 00:47:02.060
Tony Kaizen:
Not addicted of. But you can say I'm addicted to rap music. Makes perfect sense. It's normal.

473
00:47:02.060 --> 00:47:03.270
Guilherme:
Ooh. The same expression.

474
00:47:03.460 --> 00:47:09.550
Tony Kaizen:
I'm addicted to rap. I'm addicted to anime. I'm addicted to scary movies. Whatever you want. Yeah.

475
00:47:09.970 --> 00:47:16.320
Guilherme:
Oh, okay. I was looking for for something in English. This makes sense.

476
00:47:16.440 --> 00:47:20.980
So Eu sou viciado em... This is the same expression. Addicted.

477
00:47:21.160 --> 00:47:22.950
Tony Kaizen:
Addicted to.

478
00:47:23.570 --> 00:47:34.810
Guilherme:
I love it. So.. This is so incredible. And I'm addictive for a rap music.

479
00:47:34.810 --> 00:47:37.150
Tony Kaizen:
Addicted. Addicted to rap music.

480
00:47:37.730 --> 00:47:47.900
Guilherme:
Addicted to. Addicted. Addic... Okay, I just put in Google translator and listen. Addicted.

481
00:47:48.030 --> 00:47:49.930
Tony Kaizen:
Addicted. Addicted.

482
00:47:49.930 --> 00:47:58.240
Guilherme:
Addicted. It's TD a lot of TD TD. Addicted to rap music.

483
00:47:59.370 --> 00:48:09.740
And when I, [inaudible] when I listen to Kendrick, for example.

484
00:48:11.210 --> 00:48:20.380
I don't know if if his voice or something like that is difficult to me understand.

485
00:48:23.450 --> 00:48:33.690
I don't know. Tupac is easier because he speaks clearly.

486
00:48:34.250 --> 00:48:38.010
Clearlyn, clearly. De forma mais clara. I don't know how to say that.

487
00:48:38.010 --> 00:48:38.490
Tony Kaizen:
More clearly.

488
00:48:39.350 --> 00:48:45.160
Guilherme:
More clearly. And Kendrick is... I don't known if it's his voice or something.

489
00:48:45.250 --> 00:48:48.340
I love Kendrick. I love Kendrick. Kendrick is amazing.

490
00:48:48.820 --> 00:48:57.450
But I... when I listen Kendrick, I have no idea what I am saying.

491
00:49:01.020 --> 00:49:10.410
Like then I go to Rap Genius or something like that. I read the le... the lyric, the letter.

492
00:49:10.410 --> 00:49:11.810
Tony Kaizen:
The lyrics. Yeah.

493
00:49:12.260 --> 00:49:20.410
Guilherme:
The lyrics. It's in Portuguese it's all letra. English it's lyrics.

494
00:49:21.690 --> 00:49:24.330
Then, I understand what him saying.

495
00:49:24.890 --> 00:49:25.480
Tony Kaizen:
What he's saying.

496
00:49:25.480 --> 00:49:31.610
Guilherme:
But... what he say... He saying, saying, saying. What he saying.

497
00:49:32.320 --> 00:49:41.680
So I will make the same... I will do the same process you did.

498
00:49:44.960 --> 00:49:51.950
And listen Brazilian rap because if she works too, if it works to me.

499
00:49:52.560 --> 00:49:54.690
Tony Kaizen:
If it works for you, it works for me.

500
00:49:55.510 --> 00:50:03.090
Guilherme:
It's work for you, it's work for me. I know, I think. So thank you.

501
00:50:03.590 --> 00:50:12.340
I thought that that's not work for me. Learn rap music, English rap music.

502
00:50:13.420 --> 00:50:21.560
It's, it's harder. It's not like watch Friends, you know, watch How I Met Your Mother.

503
00:50:22.290 --> 00:50:28.360
It's... I don't know. It's black English. You could use this term?

504
00:50:28.630 --> 00:50:35.940
This Black English in U.S? In Brazil you say a lot 'Black English',

505
00:50:36.030 --> 00:50:44.770
like Atlanta the series of Donald Glover they are saying black English.

506
00:50:44.820 --> 00:50:50.790
It's different like, Friends or How I Met Your Mother. This... how I say this?

507
00:50:50.950 --> 00:50:55.450
Essa distinção, essa diferença nos Estados Unidos.

508
00:50:56.730 --> 00:51:01.170
Tony Kaizen:
Yeah. That difference in the United States. Yeah. So to answer your first question, we don't...

509
00:51:02.350 --> 00:51:06.630
It's not something that we say on a regular basis, like Black English or something like that.

510
00:51:07.260 --> 00:51:11.910
That term kind of, I think, evolved over time. Some people call it Ebonics,

511
00:51:12.150 --> 00:51:15.170
Some people call it like, African American vernacular English.

512
00:51:15.170 --> 00:51:18.980
There's a bunch of names for it. But it's not something that we really think too much about.

513
00:51:18.980 --> 00:51:21.730
We just kind of talk the way we talk. It's all English to us.

514
00:51:22.100 --> 00:51:27.860
But we do recognize, even if, like, subconsciously, a difference between the two.

515
00:51:28.480 --> 00:51:32.170
Yeah, there's a distinct difference in culture, even though we're all American.

516
00:51:33.380 --> 00:51:45.550
Guilherme:
Oh, okay. It's like Brazil there's a difference in the Portuguese we say in business, for example, and you say in neighborhood.

517
00:51:46.150 --> 00:51:46.800
Tony Kaizen:
Sure. Yeah. Yeah.

518
00:51:46.800 --> 00:51:55.060
Guilherme:
It's two different languages. And this is... For me it's like listening Racionais.

519
00:51:55.060 --> 00:52:06.780
I understand the language. It's what I live. It's, I think for you listen, I don't know,

520
00:52:07.250 --> 00:52:10.380
Tupac or Big or something like that it's the same.

521
00:52:10.790 --> 00:52:18.170
Okay, they say what I'm living or what I'm living or what I, what I live to or something like that.

522
00:52:18.930 --> 00:52:25.840
But they... This language, the expressions, it's it's normal.

523
00:52:25.840 --> 00:52:32.890
It's like day to day or something like that. Day to day? I think it's that, dia a dia.

524
00:52:32.890 --> 00:52:33.740
Tony Kaizen:
Yeah. Day to day. Sure.

525
00:52:34.170 --> 00:52:44.070
Guilherme:
Day to day. So I want to learn rap English because I love it.

526
00:52:44.180 --> 00:52:48.720
I would like it to understand what Kendrick is saying.

527
00:52:49.170 --> 00:52:52.020
Tony Kaizen:
Yeah. Of course. Of course. And you mentioned that as well.

528
00:52:52.020 --> 00:52:57.710
I think with Kendrick specifically, one, he rapped so fast, man, so fast.

529
00:52:57.730 --> 00:53:03.280
But then also his voice is typically very low and it's almost as if he's not mumbling,

530
00:53:03.500 --> 00:53:07.400
But it's very difficult to understand if you're not paying close attention,

531
00:53:07.400 --> 00:53:13.500
Whereas somebody like Tupac raps slower and louder. He opens his mouth more when he speaks.

532
00:53:13.500 --> 00:53:17.170
So it's just two completely different ways of speaking in general I think,

533
00:53:17.590 --> 00:53:21.450
That makes it more difficult. But I think anything can work to be honest.

534
00:53:21.450 --> 00:53:24.710
Books can work, movies can work, music can work, anything can work.

535
00:53:25.040 --> 00:53:28.450
It just depends on what you're most interested in because then it becomes fun

536
00:53:28.450 --> 00:53:30.680
And you don't feel like you're studying anymore.

537
00:53:31.110 --> 00:53:33.640
And I also think it depends on what type of language you're trying to learn.

538
00:53:33.640 --> 00:53:39.290
Because obviously you're probably not going to learn the language that you use in a Kendrick album

539
00:53:40.090 --> 00:53:44.050
That you would use in a business meeting or an interview or something like that.

540
00:53:44.050 --> 00:53:45.460
It's two completely different ways of talking.

541
00:53:45.460 --> 00:53:47.700
So you have to know, how do I want to speak?

542
00:53:48.320 --> 00:53:52.260
And then that will help you choose the right study material. You know what I mean?

543
00:53:52.510 --> 00:54:02.870
Guilherme:
Yeah, yeah, yeah. So I have to study two different languages, more or less.

544
00:54:02.870 --> 00:54:13.300
This business and street language or something like that. Is I have to study and I will study the words.

545
00:54:13.840 --> 00:54:23.050
If you care, if you're... I have a question about some expression and question you about some expression in English,

546
00:54:23.490 --> 00:54:30.230
In a rap music or something like that. Just to say.. What is Tony.. Is the..

547
00:54:30.560 --> 00:54:43.320
Something, some expression. Oh oh, can I, can I have a... One question, one simple question is I always...

548
00:54:45.430 --> 00:54:54.230
The word, one word, the N word. I'm a black man, okay? But I'm a Brazilian black man.

549
00:54:54.700 --> 00:55:01.770
I'm not American black man. If I go to U.S and say nigger or something like that,

550
00:55:02.520 --> 00:55:09.080
It's the same thing to you say nigger or it's different because I'm foreign?

551
00:55:12.710 --> 00:55:14.810
I don't know if you understand what I mean.

552
00:55:14.950 --> 00:55:17.450
Tony Kaizen:
I understand. I understand. I'm just thinking about my answer.

553
00:55:17.800 --> 00:55:20.810
And I would say that it's different because you're not from here.

554
00:55:21.350 --> 00:55:24.620
But if you said it to somebody and you said it naturally,

555
00:55:25.530 --> 00:55:30.870
I don't think people would have a strange reaction, because you look like a black man.

556
00:55:31.240 --> 00:55:36.320
You see what I'm saying? So if you're just in a casual conversation and it comes out and you say naturally,

557
00:55:37.170 --> 00:55:40.700
most people would think that's normal because you look like somebody who would say something like that.

558
00:55:41.070 --> 00:55:44.470
But if you say it and it's obvious you're not from here, it's like,

559
00:55:44.470 --> 00:55:47.330
Why are you saying that word? You know?

560
00:55:47.330 --> 00:55:50.560
That's probably the reaction that most people would have.

561
00:55:51.300 --> 00:55:53.460
Guilherme:
Okay. If I was a white guy. Never.

562
00:55:54.600 --> 00:55:58.010
Tony Kaizen:
Yeah. Most... I mean, I can't say never because everyone says it, bro.

563
00:55:58.010 --> 00:56:01.440
They just say it at certain times around certain people, but everyone says that word.

564
00:56:01.840 --> 00:56:09.040
So I would say if it were that case, it was like some white dude in most cases, it's not going to be good.

565
00:56:09.830 --> 00:56:15.610
Guilherme:
Okay. Because I know you saying this a lot.

566
00:56:16.240 --> 00:56:16.960
Tony Kaizen:
All the time. Yeah.

567
00:56:17.800 --> 00:56:24.960
Guilherme:
All the time. It's not, it's not a bad word. And it's a bad, it's a bad word.

568
00:56:24.960 --> 00:56:26.400
Tony Kaizen:
It is but we just say it anyway.

569
00:56:26.490 --> 00:56:34.490
Guilherme:
It is a bad word. But like for you guys, it's like my homie or something like that. It's okay...

570
00:56:34.490 --> 00:56:36.770
Tony Kaizen:
In some cases, yeah. It depends. But yeah.

571
00:56:37.090 --> 00:56:43.040
Guilherme:
If you, if you have a friend or something like that, it's you have a friend.

572
00:56:43.040 --> 00:56:48.220
Oh okay, it's my homie, it's my nigga or something like that. I don't know if I thro...

573
00:56:48.580 --> 00:56:59.190
If why, if I was think it's wrong, but I think it's like... In Brazil we have the same.

574
00:56:59.460 --> 00:57:09.700
Ok, like equivalent. Nigger is criolo, for example. Criolo is the same, ok?

575
00:57:09.950 --> 00:57:19.320
Bad word, slavery, all this kind of shit. But Criolo, there's a artist with this name.

576
00:57:19.990 --> 00:57:28.630
Criolo. It's like you if you have an artist and call himself nigger.

577
00:57:29.020 --> 00:57:29.080
Tony Kaizen:
Yeah.

578
00:57:29.710 --> 00:57:38.870
Guilherme:
I could say it's strange. But okay, it's for us it's normal. Criolo or something like that.

579
00:57:39.850 --> 00:57:49.190
So thank you for answering me. And if I go to United States, I never say that word. Because...

580
00:57:49.190 --> 00:57:51.430
Tony Kaizen:
I think it's the better choice. Yeah. I mean, you can.

581
00:57:51.430 --> 00:57:53.280
I think it's better to just avoid it.

582
00:57:53.280 --> 00:58:00.180
Guilherme:
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. He beat him up to me. I know he beat me and I don't. So...

583
00:58:00.290 --> 00:58:01.460
Tony Kaizen:
They will beat me up. Yeah. Yeah.

584
00:58:02.170 --> 00:58:07.250
Guilherme:
Beat me up. Yes. So no. Thanks for explain.

585
00:58:07.390 --> 00:58:08.550
Tony Kaizen:
Of course, man.

586
00:58:09.320 --> 00:58:13.920
Guilherme:
But is it.. Any one.. Do have any question or something like that?

587
00:58:15.740 --> 00:58:16.250
Tony Kaizen:
Say that again.

588
00:58:17.830 --> 00:58:19.740
Guilherme:
Do you have any questions for me?

589
00:58:19.740 --> 00:58:21.190
Tony Kaizen:
Oh a bunch. Yeah, of course. A bunch, man.

590
00:58:21.190 --> 00:58:23.640
But actually, I just noticed it's about 4:40,

591
00:58:23.900 --> 00:58:25.670
So I got to get ready to go to work, man. But...

592
00:58:26.060 --> 00:58:26.940
Guilherme:
Uh, no problem.

593
00:58:26.940 --> 00:58:30.570
Tony Kaizen:
What's today? Tuesday. So tomorrow morning, most likely, I'll be back online.

594
00:58:30.570 --> 00:58:34.130
But any time, man, send me a message or music, videos,

595
00:58:34.130 --> 00:58:37.220
Whatever you're working on, man, you got questions about. So...

596
00:58:37.760 --> 00:58:44.300
Guilherme:
Oh, thanks. Thanks. Thanks a lot. Because I have a lot of questions, but I know...

597
00:58:44.430 --> 00:58:51.440
I don't know how to say in English an expression, encher o saco em Portuguese.

598
00:58:51.470 --> 00:58:56.250
Tony Kaizen:
Ahh pelo amor de... Nah, encher o saco would be like "Get on your nerves".

599
00:58:56.480 --> 00:58:58.750
Let me write that for you. I'm gonna send it to you.

600
00:58:58.750 --> 00:59:00.100
Guilherme:
Get in your nerves.

601
00:59:00.100 --> 00:59:02.520
Tony Kaizen:
Get on someone's nerves.

602
00:59:02.520 --> 00:59:04.180
Guilherme:
Get on your nerves. Okay.

603
00:59:04.750 --> 00:59:05.050
Tony Kaizen:
Yes.

604
00:59:05.050 --> 00:59:05.960
Guilherme:
I will not do that.

605
00:59:06.510 --> 00:59:09.080
Tony Kaizen:
No, of course not, man. That's what I'm here for. That's what I'm here for.

606
00:59:09.080 --> 00:59:11.070
Guilherme:
Oh, get on someone's nerves.

607
00:59:11.070 --> 00:59:12.760
Tony Kaizen:
Exaclty. Encher o saco de alguém.

608
00:59:12.820 --> 00:59:16.560
Guilherme:
Oh understand. Get on nerv... Ah encher o saco. Get on nerves.

609
00:59:16.560 --> 00:59:21.400
Tony Kaizen:
Like, Man this girl is getting on my nerves or that noise is getting on my nerves, or something like that.

610
00:59:21.640 --> 00:59:23.980
Guilherme:
Ah okay, I don't do that. Okay?

611
00:59:24.390 --> 00:59:27.290
Tony Kaizen:
It's all good. It's all good.

612
00:59:29.240 --> 00:59:39.380
Guilherme:
Stay cool. And that's it, I think. And it's not, I'm don't, I'm not... Not don't.

613
00:59:40.610 --> 00:59:44.380
Wait, I'm not too nervous anymore. I'm don't nervous anymore. How do you say?

614
00:59:44.450 --> 00:59:45.470
Tony Kaizen:
I'm not nervous anymore.

615
00:59:46.400 --> 00:59:55.280
Guilherme:
I'm not nervous. Not and don't is... It's hard. Not. Don't. I'm not nervous anymore.

616
00:59:56.280 --> 01:00:02.400
You're incredible, man. You're amazing. I love talk to you.

617
01:00:02.680 --> 01:00:04.880
Tony Kaizen:
Thank you, man. I appreciate that. I really enjoyed the conversation

618
01:00:04.880 --> 01:00:08.130
And I'm sure we'll have many more, man. Rap is one of my favorite subjects,

619
01:00:08.130 --> 01:00:11.100
So we'll always have something to talk about. That's for sure.

620
01:00:11.100 --> 01:00:15.070
Guilherme:
Ohh. Yeah. So you're home.

621
01:00:15.550 --> 01:00:17.850
Tony Kaizen:
Exactly. We're at home, man. That's it.

622
01:00:17.850 --> 01:00:25.080
Guilherme:
So that's it. I have to go now. Because I'm have dinner tonight.

623
01:00:25.160 --> 01:00:29.740
Make dinner. To make dinner is sense, right? I have to make dinner.

624
01:00:29.790 --> 01:00:32.410
Tony Kaizen:
Are you going to cook dinner yourself?

625
01:00:32.630 --> 01:00:33.360
Guilherme:
Yeah. Cook dinner.

626
01:00:33.360 --> 01:00:35.620
Tony Kaizen:
Then yeah, you will make dinner. Yeah.

627
01:00:36.200 --> 01:00:40.530
Guilherme:
Make dinner. Yeah. And if I... vou jantar. Fazer a janta é cook dinner.

628
01:00:40.560 --> 01:00:42.440
Eu vou jantar é, it's make dinner?

629
01:00:42.440 --> 01:00:47.660
Tony Kaizen:
Nah, fazer a janta e cozinhar you can say 'make dinner' or 'cook dinner'. Same thing.

630
01:00:47.740 --> 01:00:52.710
But jantar, o verbo would be 'to eat dinner' or 'have dinner', you know?

631
01:00:52.840 --> 01:00:56.790
Guilherme:
Oh okay. So have dinner it's eating.

632
01:00:56.790 --> 01:00:59.790
Tony Kaizen:
Jantar. Yeah, exactly. If I'm having dinner, I'm eating dinner. Same thing.

633
01:01:00.400 --> 01:01:06.050
Guilherme:
Okay. It's cozinhar it's cook or make dinner. That's the difference.

634
01:01:06.150 --> 01:01:06.790
Tony Kaizen:
Exactly. Exaclty.

635
01:01:07.180 --> 01:01:08.240
Guilherme:
Perfect. Thank you.

636
01:01:08.480 --> 01:01:09.160
Tony Kaizen:
Of course, man.

637
01:01:10.630 --> 01:01:10.950
Guilherme:
Okay.

638
01:01:11.290 --> 01:01:13.770
Tony Kaizen:
Enjoy your dinner, my friend. I'm actually gonna get some lunch

639
01:01:13.770 --> 01:01:16.750
And then head off to work myself. So we'll talk soon, my friend.

640
01:01:17.760 --> 01:01:18.850
Guilherme:
Okay. See ya. Bye-bye.

641
01:01:19.110 --> 01:01:20.190
Tony Kaizen:
All right. See you, man. Take care.

642
01:01:21.800 --> 01:01:23.400
All right, y'all. That's it for this episode.

643
01:01:23.400 --> 01:01:27.540
So hopefully you enjoyed the conversation between Guilherme and me, a.

644
01:01:27.540 --> 01:01:32.950
Nd hopefully, now it's even more clear that you really can learn any language, but in this case,

645
01:01:33.170 --> 01:01:38.190
English from the comfort of your home spending relatively little money or none whatsoever.

646
01:01:38.720 --> 01:01:42.420
I think it's more of a question of how interested you are in the language,

647
01:01:42.420 --> 01:01:46.800
How much time and effort you dedicate to learning this language on a consistent basis,

648
01:01:47.110 --> 01:01:51.130
And also how often you're speaking to and listening to real people.

649
01:01:51.710 --> 01:01:54.970
So if that's something that you are interested in, you know, speaking to real people,

650
01:01:54.970 --> 01:01:59.220
Learning English, and making friends with real people from around the world, including myself,

651
01:01:59.640 --> 01:02:07.120

It really is a great place to learn the English language,

653
01:02:09.930 --> 01:02:13.420
But also just make some friends and have a good time while you do it. You know what I'm saying?

654
01:02:14.040 --> 01:02:17.290
But that's it for this episode. Like I said, hopefully you enjoyed it, man.

655
01:02:17.290 --> 01:02:20.840
This is Life in English. I'm your host, Tony Kaizen.

656
01:02:21.280 --> 01:02:23.100
And I'll talk to you soon.

657

Peace!

00:00:01.540 --> 00:00:04.390
What's up, my friend? This is Coffee with Kaizen number 34.

2
00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:08.710
And the title of this episode will most likely be "talk to children".

3
00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:14.230
And I feel some type of way about that title "talk to children".

4
00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:17.740
It sounds kind of weird, right? If somebody said, "Hey, stranger. Talk to kids".

5
00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:23.410
If somebody said that to you, you'd be like, Bro, what the fuck? What you mean?

6
00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:28.290
But I mean exactly what I say. You should talk to children.

7
00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:33.300
I'm here today to talk about why you should talk to more children more often.

8
00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:38.450
Because I was watching my nephew play PlayStation a couple of weeks ago,

9
00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:43.320
And it was just so fascinating to me to hear the way he talks to his friends, you know,

10
00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:46.440
Their slang and their expressions and all that type of stuff.

11
00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:53.340
Because, I mean, you know, like older people, teenagers, and children,

12
00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:56.390
We all have our own way of talking, even if we speak the same language.

13
00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:02.620
And the next generation always innovates, right? In many different ways in fashion,

14
00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:08.270
Music, business, I mean, all kinds of things. But particularly language, right?

15
00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:12.110
The next generation invents their own slang and expressions

16
00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:17.050
And they have their own way of interacting with each other and stuff like that that we as adults

17
00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:20.910
Or older people might not totally understand or be familiar with. Right?

18
00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:29.350
And a lot of times in general, a lot of adults think about children as if children and babies are the same thing.

19
00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:35.210
Because a baby is like this adorable, cute, little, helpless human being.

20
00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:39.610
And it's, you know, it's so cute. They don't understand half the stuff that you're saying

21
00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:44.080
And they don't understand anything about how life works, how society works, and all these things.

22
00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:46.900
So there are certain things you can't talk about them or excuse me,

23
00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:50.590
There are certain things you can't talk about with them because they just won't comprehend

24
00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:53.450
And they won't be able to even express themselves to you.

25
00:01:54.270 --> 00:02:01.050
But a kid, you know, eight years old, nine years old, twelve years old, you can talk to these people, you know?

26
00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:06.470
And a lot of people look at kids these age as if they're just silly little kids.

27
00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:13.050
They don't know anything. They don't understand life. We can't talk about anything interesting.

28
00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:17.000
We can't have an intelligent conversation. It's just a kid. But I completely disagree, man.

29
00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:23.810
I completely disagree. I mean, in my experience,

30
00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:29.130
If you give kids the chance a lot of times they might surprise you.

31
00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:35.120
A lot of kids know a lot more than you give them credit for.

32
00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:39.060
A lot of kids understand a lot more than you give them credit for, you know?

33
00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:42.980
And even if they don't, you can teach them. That's the point.

34
00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:48.630
Because at nine years old, in most cases, a kid is out of place mentally,

35
00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:55.330
Linguistically... Where you can teach them complex things. You can have mature conversations.

36
00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:57.370
You can talk to them like adults if you really want to.

37
00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:00.740
That's what I prefer to do. I don't like talking to kids as if they're babies.

38
00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:05.030
Like, Hey, how you doing? You're so cute. Good to see you.

39
00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:07.500
You want to play a game? You want some candy?

40
00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:11.750
I hate... I shouldn't say 'hate', that's a strong word.

41
00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:17.080
But I just don't understand why people talk to children like that. That shit isn't cute.

42
00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:18.980
It's not funny. It doesn't help in any way.

43
00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:22.960
The more you treat a child like a baby, the more they feel they should act like a baby.

44
00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:26.030
You know what I'm saying? I just never understood that.

45
00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:32.310
Whereas if you talk to a kid the same way you would talk to an adult, in my experience,

46
00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:37.930
The kid will elevate intellectually or they will mature faster.

47
00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:39.880
And some people think that's not, that's not a good thing.

48
00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:42.920
Some people think that you should let kids be kids.

49
00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:45.550
You shouldn't be trying to get them to mature faster.

50
00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:50.470
You shouldn't be introducing these complex or adult-like subjects to them

51
00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:53.180
Because they just need to enjoy their childhood. And that's true.

52
00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:56.700
You should let kids be kids and enjoy their childhood. But at the end of the day,

53
00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:02.480
Our job as adults is to prepare them for adulthood. Eventually, they're going to be adults, right?

54
00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:06.230
So at what age do you decide to start treating a kid like an adult?

55
00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:18.730
Is it 15? 18, 21? I mean, what's the age? I don't know.

56
00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:23.750
But anyway, getting back to what I was saying. I was listening to my nephew talk to his friends,

57
00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:27.600
And it was just so fascinating, man, how they got their own slang and expressions.

58
00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:31.020
And even like, in a group of friends that are eight or nine years old,

59
00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:34.800
They just naturally create their own little hierarchy.

60
00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:41.460
There's like, a "leader" in the group, and each member in the group has their own personality and stuff like that.

61
00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:45.170
It's just interesting. It's interesting. Any group of people, regardless of the age,

62
00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:49.110
But particularly kids, when you can see those adult-like traits

63
00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:54.720
Or you can see some of the same behavior that we display as adults, it's kind of funny. It's interesting.

64
00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:00.770
And I just think there's so many reasons that you should talk to children.

65
00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:05.000
So sticking with the language aspect, just by talking to children,

66
00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.730
You get more familiar with the new slang, the new expressions like,

67
00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:12.750
And you also get to have your finger on the pulse of the next generation.

68
00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:18.440
And when I say "you have your finger on the pulse", I'm saying like,

69
00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:23.140
you are directly involved in whatever this thing is.

70
00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:28.780
So if I have my finger on the pulse of the music industry, it means that I'm deeply involved in it.

71
00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:31.500
And I know exactly what's happening. I know what's happening right now

72
00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:37.550
And I know what's about to happen. Right? I'm updated or I'm a... What's the word?

73
00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:42.970
Damn, I can't think of the expression. But I know what's going on.

74
00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:46.960
I'm tapped in. I'm plugged in. I'm connected, you know?

75
00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:51.310
I'm not oblivious to what's going on. I'm not an outsider or something like that.

76
00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:57.560
So I guess the opposite of having your finger on the pulse would be being out of touch.

77
00:05:58.600 --> 00:06:04.500
Because to be out of touch with something or someone means like, it's so distant from you,

78
00:06:04.790 --> 00:06:08.250
Metaphorically, that you don't know anything about it or understand it.

79
00:06:08.250 --> 00:06:12.510
If I'm out of touch, it means I don't really know about that. It's like, What?

80
00:06:12.510 --> 00:06:16.480
You didn't see the new movie? You didn't hear that new song? You didn't see that performance?

81
00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:18.850
Like, Nah, man, I'm kind of out of touch with that type of stuff.

82
00:06:19.490 --> 00:06:22.090
Which means I don't really know what goes on in that world. I'm not connected.

83
00:06:22.180 --> 00:06:25.640
I have no idea. Right? That's what it means to be out of touch.

84
00:06:25.890 --> 00:06:29.280
So the opposite, I guess, is to have your finger on the pulse, which is, you know,

85
00:06:29.350 --> 00:06:33.640
I know exactly what's going on. I'm plugged in. I'm aware of what's happening, you know?

86
00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:36.940
So when you talk to kids, you have your finger on the pulse of the next generation.

87
00:06:36.940 --> 00:06:39.340
You know what they're thinking about. You know what they talk about.

88
00:06:39.540 --> 00:06:45.970
You know what's important to them. You see what I'm saying? You need to talk to kids, right?

89
00:06:45.970 --> 00:06:50.000
Because they're the future. The next generation is the future.

90
00:06:50.930 --> 00:06:59.290
And in my experience, it's much better to understand what's coming next than it is to reject

91
00:07:00.030 --> 00:07:03.690
Or put down or diminish what's coming next.

92
00:07:03.690 --> 00:07:06.670
That's what a lot of people do like I was saying, when they think about kids, they're like,

93
00:07:06.670 --> 00:07:09.310
Oh, it's just some silly little kid. He doesn't know shit.

94
00:07:10.920 --> 00:07:13.610
It's like, bro, that silly little kid one day we'll be taking care of you.

95
00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:18.010
You're going to be old one day. You won't be able to work or take care of yourself.

96
00:07:18.010 --> 00:07:21.640
And the next generation is the group of people that's going to support society.

97
00:07:21.710 --> 00:07:24.200
That's us right now. In the future is going to be them.

98
00:07:26.780 --> 00:07:31.630
So I don't see any advantage to not being connected to what's coming next,

99
00:07:31.630 --> 00:07:35.640
To not understanding what's coming next. That's in general with technology,

100
00:07:35.640 --> 00:07:38.250
With business, with the economy, with education, whatever.

101
00:07:38.250 --> 00:07:41.820
But in this case, kids. They're the future, you know?

102
00:07:45.230 --> 00:07:51.220
I had to take a sip of my coffee real quick. It's Coffee with Kaizen, by the way.

103
00:07:53.030 --> 00:08:02.630
But yeah, man. They're the future. You have to talk to kids. You really do.

104
00:08:03.910 --> 00:08:07.480
For so many reasons. I also think you have to talk to kids because a lot of kids,

105
00:08:07.480 --> 00:08:11.110
In my experience, especially these days, don't get listened to anymore.

106
00:08:12.530 --> 00:08:16.100
I can't say any more like that was the case in the past and it's not now.

107
00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:18.480
Because I don't feel like I was listened to as a kid.

108
00:08:18.480 --> 00:08:22.460
I feel like most kids in general aren't listened to by adults or talked to by adults.

109
00:08:22.780 --> 00:08:29.290
But these days a lot of adults will just hand their kids a tablet or smartphone or the TV remote and say,

110
00:08:29.290 --> 00:08:32.100
"Go over there. Be quiet. Leave me alone. Don't make any noise for 2 hours".

111
00:08:34.590 --> 00:08:37.330
Or a lot of parents don't sit down and talk with their kids on a regular basis.

112
00:08:37.330 --> 00:08:43.820
Just talk about life. My parents never did that shit. Never.

113
00:08:43.820 --> 00:08:46.970
Not once did we sit down and just talk about life or anything like that.

114
00:08:46.990 --> 00:08:50.250
What I was thinking about, what I was going through. Nothing. Nothing.

115
00:08:50.710 --> 00:08:53.890
And I just think you need to talk to kids, man.

116
00:08:53.890 --> 00:08:57.660
You need to understand how they think and what's important to them.

117
00:08:57.660 --> 00:09:02.200
And I think when you talk to a kid and more importantly, you listen to a kid,

118
00:09:04.650 --> 00:09:07.180
You're showing them respect and you're showing them that they're important

119
00:09:07.250 --> 00:09:10.540
And that you value what they have to say. You're interested in what they have to say.

120
00:09:13.850 --> 00:09:15.970
And that makes, I think it makes the kid want to talk more.

121
00:09:15.970 --> 00:09:18.980
That's how you gain the trust of a kid and they really start to communicate with you

122
00:09:19.690 --> 00:09:24.580
So you can really know what's going on in their head and inside their live and... inside their life, excuse me.

123
00:09:29.450 --> 00:09:35.730
I just think that's a really important thing to do because a lot of kids have a lot of thoughts

124
00:09:35.730 --> 00:09:38.420
And feelings and they're confused about a lot of things as they grow up.

125
00:09:38.420 --> 00:09:42.430
A lot of things they don't understand. A lot of things they go through and they don't know why.

126
00:09:42.430 --> 00:09:46.070
And a lot of times they don't really have anyone to talk to about it,

127
00:09:46.170 --> 00:09:49.000
Or they might not think that anyone could ever understand them.

128
00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:57.400
So by talking to them and listening to them, you might be able to help them in that area, you know?

129
00:09:58.720 --> 00:10:04.950
You might be able to teach them many things or explain very simple things to them that they couldn't understand.

130
00:10:05.890 --> 00:10:10.000
You can better prepare them for what's coming next because whether we all like it or not,

131
00:10:10.050 --> 00:10:15.260
They're not going to be kids forever. So by talking to them consistently, staying in contact with them,

132
00:10:15.990 --> 00:10:20.360
It's almost like you're a mentor. You know? In a way, that's what parents are.

133
00:10:20.360 --> 00:10:25.190
You are your child's mentor, responsible for helping them grow and develop as humans.

134
00:10:25.690 --> 00:10:29.270
And you can't do that if you're not talking to them, if you're not having conversations with them.

135
00:10:31.030 --> 00:10:40.970
So yeah, man. It's just something to think about. You can learn so much from talking to kids.

136
00:10:42.200 --> 00:10:46.620
The same way you can, like a lot of people will show elders respect.

137
00:10:46.700 --> 00:10:49.000
Older people, your grandparents, great grandparents...

138
00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:52.090
A lot of people will just naturally show them respect like, they've been through a lot.

139
00:10:52.470 --> 00:10:55.920
They've lived a full life. They're so wise. They can teach me so much.

140
00:10:55.920 --> 00:10:59.580
They've been where I am right now and they've been where I want to be,

141
00:10:59.580 --> 00:11:02.690
So I'm going to listen to them. You ever notice that?

142
00:11:02.690 --> 00:11:07.080
You show older people so much more respect and admiration, and you give them so much more attention.

143
00:11:07.650 --> 00:11:11.140
You listen so much more attentively to an older person who seems wise,

144
00:11:11.180 --> 00:11:15.630
But you won't show that same respect to a child because it's just a silly kid. He doesn't know shit.

145
00:11:18.560 --> 00:11:20.260
I just don't think that's the right mentality to have.

146
00:11:21.810 --> 00:11:29.470
Kids can teach you so much. Their perspective is different, you know? Everyone's perspective.

147
00:11:29.470 --> 00:11:32.860
And really this... the title of this episode should be "talk to people", right?

148
00:11:32.860 --> 00:11:37.340
But I was just thinking about my nephew and how children specifically don't get talked to

149
00:11:37.340 --> 00:11:50.100
Or listened to as much as adults. So yeah, man, you can learn a lot by talking to kids.

150
00:11:50.100 --> 00:11:54.170
You can help kids by talking to them. Because I don't know about you,

151
00:11:54.170 --> 00:11:56.830
But I know what it feels like to be a kid and have no one to talk to.

152
00:11:57.050 --> 00:12:01.920
Nobody understands. Nobody can explain anything to me. Nobody listens to me or nothing like that.

153
00:12:01.920 --> 00:12:08.680
It's not a good feeling, man. It has a negative effect on a kid and the way they develop, you know?

154
00:12:10.920 --> 00:12:13.900
So I didn't take any notes or write anything down for this episode.

155
00:12:13.900 --> 00:12:15.990
I think if I would have taken more time to prepare,

156
00:12:16.410 --> 00:12:19.140
Then I could have given you like, a logical order and, you know,

157
00:12:19.190 --> 00:12:24.820
Clear points that I wanted to touch on as reasons why you should talk to children.

158
00:12:24.820 --> 00:12:28.500
But I'm kind of just rambling here. I think I've got my point across, right?

159
00:12:28.500 --> 00:12:31.560
Because at the end of the day, there's many reasons to talk to kids.

160
00:12:31.930 --> 00:12:35.760
You can have your finger on the pulse of the next generation and understand what's important to them,

161
00:12:35.760 --> 00:12:40.880
Understand the way they talk, the slang that they use, and you know, what they want for their future.

162
00:12:40.880 --> 00:12:44.870
And maybe you can even help them prepare themselves to get what they want in the future.

163
00:12:45.830 --> 00:12:49.660
You can't do that without talking to them. And you can't do that without listen...

164
00:12:49.660 --> 00:12:55.690
The title of this episode should be "listen to children", not talk to them. And to listen to them.

165
00:12:57.480 --> 00:13:02.300
Especially today, because like a lot of... It's crazy to me how so many parents will give their child

166
00:13:02.300 --> 00:13:08.170
A smartphone at six years old, seven years old, eight, twelve years old.

167
00:13:09.890 --> 00:13:15.310
What the fuck does a kid need a smartphone for? What is he going to call? Nobody.

168
00:13:15.310 --> 00:13:18.550
He's going to get on these fucking apps, these websites or whatever, social media.

169
00:13:19.230 --> 00:13:25.670
He's got the world in his hands. And he has no idea how to process all that information.

170
00:13:26.970 --> 00:13:32.890
Now you can put child locks and, you know, security codes on certain websites or apps and shit like that.

171
00:13:32.890 --> 00:13:36.920
You can try your hardest to make sure they can't access certain things, but even still.

172
00:13:41.110 --> 00:13:43.410
I don't know. It's just... To me, it's a little dangerous.

173
00:13:44.640 --> 00:13:47.560
So now more than ever, we need to talk to kids about what they're consuming,

174
00:13:47.560 --> 00:13:52.000
What they've seen, what they're thinking about. Because if you're not talking to your kids,

175
00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:57.210
Somebody else certainly is talking to your kids. And that's fine.

176
00:13:57.210 --> 00:14:02.170
Like, I think it's kind of weird to me as well that a lot of parents won't let their children talk to strangers.

177
00:14:03.840 --> 00:14:06.730
Now, of course, we know that there are many dangers of letting kids talk to strangers,

178
00:14:06.730 --> 00:14:09.760
But as long as they're supervised, I don't see the problem.

179
00:14:11.500 --> 00:14:14.470
They need to be exposed to other adults, other kids, other ways of thinking,

180
00:14:14.470 --> 00:14:17.750
Other cultures, other lifestyles, philosophies, all that.

181
00:14:17.750 --> 00:14:19.530
They need to be exposed to that as early as possible.

182
00:14:20.120 --> 00:14:25.280
But as the parent or the big brother or sister, as the aunt or uncle or whatever,

183
00:14:25.870 --> 00:14:28.260
I still think it's our responsibility to talk to them as well.

184
00:14:30.320 --> 00:14:33.170
About all the stuff that they're consuming, about all the stuff that they're experiencing.

185
00:14:33.170 --> 00:14:36.570
Because at the end of the day, life is life. Being a kid is being a kid.

186
00:14:36.570 --> 00:14:39.100
Being an adult is being an adult. I don't think that's ever going to change.

187
00:14:39.400 --> 00:14:46.570
However, times have changed. Being a kid today isn't necessarily the same thing as being a kid

188
00:14:46.740 --> 00:14:51.720
20 years ago or 40 years ago, or 60 years ago. Things have changed.

189
00:14:54.000 --> 00:15:00.490
And we have to talk about those changes, I think. We have to have our finger on the pulse of society,

190
00:15:01.040 --> 00:15:04.080
Of the next generation because that's the future. You know?

191
00:15:05.240 --> 00:15:10.790
So that's one reason. But also, I think kids can teach you so much, you know?

192
00:15:10.790 --> 00:15:13.140
Because their perspective is so different.

193
00:15:15.160 --> 00:15:17.460
And just because they're young doesn't mean that they can't teach you something

194
00:15:17.460 --> 00:15:22.500
Or see the same situation in a better way or a more productive way or more advantageous way.

195
00:15:22.500 --> 00:15:28.630
You just never know. So that's another reason.

196
00:15:30.360 --> 00:15:35.650
And because I think kids are getting talked to by the ones closest to them a lot less

197
00:15:35.650 --> 00:15:41.070
And they're being listened to a lot less. And I could be wrong. Just the impression I have.

198
00:15:42.810 --> 00:15:48.030
But, I know what it feels like, and I'm sure... I don't know.

199
00:15:48.230 --> 00:15:53.370
But I imagine you know what it feels like. To not be listened to or valued or respected or...

200
00:15:56.500 --> 00:16:01.590
Or any of that. I'm sure you know what it feels like.

201
00:16:01.590 --> 00:16:03.260
Like, Man, I wish I had somebody to talk to.

202
00:16:03.260 --> 00:16:06.680
Somebody that would listen, somebody that would understand. Kids feel like that every day.

203
00:16:06.680 --> 00:16:09.630
Adults feel like that, shit. Adults feel like that.

204
00:16:11.700 --> 00:16:13.760
But our time has gone. We're not kids anymore, right?

205
00:16:14.970 --> 00:16:19.020
But we can make sure that the next generation doesn't have to feel that way or go through that.

206
00:16:20.940 --> 00:16:24.340
Just by talking and listening to them, you know?

207
00:16:26.410 --> 00:16:31.600
So anyway, I'm sure I've got my point across and give you a couple things to think about,

208
00:16:31.600 --> 00:16:33.840
A couple of reasons you should talk to kids a lot more.

209
00:16:33.900 --> 00:16:36.560
The reasons you should listen to kids a lot more.

210
00:16:36.560 --> 00:16:39.570
I'm not going to keep rambling or keep you here any longer, my friend.

211
00:16:39.570 --> 00:16:42.960
I just wanted to share that idea with you and encourage you. Talk to kids more.

212
00:16:44.050 --> 00:16:49.830
Show them the same respect that you would show an adult. Show them the same, let's say,

213
00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:53.890
Patience and courtesy that you would show an elder that you respect.

214
00:16:55.050 --> 00:16:56.460
Just watch the difference. Watch what happens.

215
00:16:58.880 --> 00:17:01.460
Start talking to kids the same way you talk to any other adult.

216
00:17:02.900 --> 00:17:06.300
Start having those kinds of conversations and watch what happens.

217
00:17:08.110 --> 00:17:09.770
And let me know what happens. I'm very curious.

218
00:17:13.780 --> 00:17:15.960
But, I guess that's a good place to cut it, man.

219
00:17:16.090 --> 00:17:20.250
This is Coffee with Kaizen number 34. My name is Tony Kaizen,

220
00:17:20.250 --> 00:17:26.630
And I'm reminding you to talk to kids and more importantly, listen to your kids. All right?

221
00:17:26.880 --> 00:17:29.970
But that's it for now, my friend. Hopefully, you enjoyed this episode

222
00:17:30.340 --> 00:17:37.580
And it gave you some things to think about. And more podcast episodes coming soon, my friend.

223
00:17:37.580 --> 00:17:40.520
Thank you so much for being a member of the Life in English community, man.

224
00:17:40.520 --> 00:17:45.200
You have no idea how much I appreciate you and your support and you being a part of this community.

225
00:17:45.570 --> 00:17:50.930
So, yeah. That's it for now, man.

226
00:17:51.580 --> 00:17:55.410
Coffee with Kaizen number 34 in the books and I will talk to you later.

227
00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:56.330
Peace!

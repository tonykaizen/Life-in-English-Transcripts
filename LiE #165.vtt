00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:07.110
Santiago's story begins in the city of Villavicencio,
Colombia. As a young boy, his parents were very strict and

2
00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:14.100
always expected the best of him: good grades, good behavior,
a good appearance. They just wanted him to be a good kid.

3
00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:20.130
His father was a physical education teacher, so he was
always encouraged to be active and play sports like

4
00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:27.620
volleyball, soccer, and basketball, just to name a few. So
ever since he was a child, Santiago has felt this intrinsic

5
00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:34.510
need to be learning or doing something useful at all times.
As a result, the majority of his childhood was spent

6
00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:41.100
studying, playing sports, or at home with his family. He
didn't have much time to socialize with people and make

7
00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:45.780
friends because his parents were always putting him in
whatever productive or educational programs they could find.

8
00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:54.390
And when Santiago was 14, his parents came across an English
course at a local language institute. They didn't know when

9
00:00:54.740 --> 00:01:00.800
or how, but they knew that being able to speak English
proficiently would be an extremely valuable skill to possess

10
00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:08.720
in the future. So they enrolled them in the course. But the
problem for Santiago was that this course consisted of just

11
00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:13.670
one four-hour class per week for three years.

12
00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:22.530
A four-hour class in which they focus solely on grammar
rules and basic vocabulary. Of course, Santiago found the

13
00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:28.660
information useful, but at some point he realized that
during a four-hour class, he spent less than 10 minutes

14
00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:35.750
actually speaking English. But his parents had enrolled him
in the course, so he had to finish it. He followed the

15
00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:43.620
course, he memorized the information, passed the exams, and
he was certified as a C1 or advanced level English learner.

16
00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:51.720
But after three years, he still wasn't able to maintain even
a basic conversation with a real person. And that's when

17
00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:59.560
Santiago decided to look for a better way to learn English.
And just like many of us in the modern era, he started with

18
00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:04.910
video lessons on YouTube. Then he searched for English
teachers on social media, and he realized that he could

19
00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:10.880
learn a bunch of useful things about English just using his
cellphone. So we spent the next four months immersing

20
00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:17.810
himself in the language, discovering new teachers, watching
videos and taking notes. He also began teaching himself how

21
00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:23.380
to code online, and he was even using that as a way to learn
English because the majority of content made for self-taught

22
00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:31.430
programmers is in English. But that wasn't enough. While he
was getting exposed to new vocabulary and his comprehension

23
00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:36.620
was starting to improve, he still wasn't able to put
together basic sentences without translating the words in

24
00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:44.020
his head first. Now, the next part of this story is key
because this is the point at which most English learners do

25
00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:46.710
one of two things. Number one.

26
00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:57.790
Continue consuming loads of content in English. Reading,
listening, and watching occasionally. Option number two,

27
00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:07.020
begin looking for opportunities to practice speaking English
with real people, everyday. Santiago chose option number

28
00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:13.480
two. He started searching for online communities in which he
could speak with real people everyday. And luckily, these

29
00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:20.220
days there are a lot of apps and websites that help you meet
people from all over the world. For example, Discord is a

30
00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:25.790
popular platform for creating and managing online
communities. It started out as an app for gamers to connect

31
00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:31.270
with each other. But these days, all kinds of people, from
entrepreneurs to language learners, use the app to stay in

32
00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:37.600
touch with other like-minded individuals and share ideas. 
After hearing about some online communities for practicing

33
00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:44.040
English, Santiago decided to join a few of them and look for
people to speak with. Now, thanks to his upbringing, he had

34
00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:49.670
always had a hunger for knowledge and growth, so he was
determined to master the skill of communicating in English.

35
00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:57.660
But the next problem he ran into was that the majority of
communities he found online were poorly managed. There were

36
00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:05.330
lots of disrespectful members. There were no leaders. There
was no support. There was no real sense of community. But

37
00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:12.550
did Santiago let that stop him from learning? Of course not!
I already told you, this kid is determined. He kept

38
00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:19.080
searching for and joining different communities, interacting
on forums and consuming content on social media. Taking

39
00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:26.300
advantage of any and every opportunity he had to practice
his English. One day, he was scrolling on social media and

40
00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:32.750
saw a video of a teacher talking about his private online
community and he was encouraging people to join. Santiago

41
00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:38.810
knew an opportunity like that was exactly what he'd been
looking for, so he didn't hesitate to join the community.

42
00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:48.970
And this is when Santiago came to another fork in the road.
You had two options. The first one, choose the life of a

43
00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:58.290
passive community member: never interacting, never starting
conversations, never asking questions. Option number two,

44
00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:05.500
choose the life of an active community member: greeting the
community every day, sharing interesting content, and

45
00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:15.220
encouraging people to join group discussions. Which option
do you think Santiago chose? After just four

46
00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:21.520
months studying English by himself online, Santiago Gonzalez
could understand written and spoken English about many

47
00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:28.850
different things - from relationships and sports to managing
databases and writing algorithms. This was all due to a

48
00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:37.160
focused approach, consistent effort, and a burning desire to
learn something useful every single day. After just three

49
00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:42.990
months of being an active member of an online learning
community and speaking with real people every day, Santiago

50
00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:48.670
is now making friends, start in group discussions, making
people laugh, and he doesn't need to translate things in his

51
00:05:48.670 --> 00:05:57.090
head before he says them. He's showing us all that simple
things like desire, effort, and consistency can take us very

52
00:05:57.090 --> 00:06:04.530
far in life. He's made more progress by himself in the last
seven months than he made at his school in the previous

53
00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:05.960
three years.

54
00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:12.770
Now that Santiago has found a community with active members
and the support of a teacher, he can improve his

55
00:06:12.770 --> 00:06:19.680
pronunciation, learn useful words and expressions, and get
all of his questions answered in a practical way. He can

56
00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:25.560
practice speaking English daily, which gives him the
confidence to speak with anyone. And he can do all of this

57
00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:33.870
without leaving his home. But it's more than that. Santiago
isn't just learning English now. He's listening to stories,

58
00:06:33.870 --> 00:06:40.680
connecting with like-minded individuals, and learning life
lessons that will serve him for years to come. Santiago was

59
00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:47.420
lucky enough to find a community of people whom he can look
up to as role models. When I asked him what he liked most

60
00:06:47.630 --> 00:06:54.070
about his community, he said, "It's not just the English
I've learned. I see the people in this community and it

61
00:06:54.070 --> 00:07:02.740
makes me think - if they can work that hard and be so
dedicated, why can't I? So it's very inspirational and I see

62
00:07:02.740 --> 00:07:11.580
them as examples of what I would like to be in the future."
When you join a community of learners, you get more than

63
00:07:11.580 --> 00:07:18.210
just an education. You become part of something like a
family. A network of people who have been in your position

64
00:07:18.250 --> 00:07:25.750
and want nothing more than to see you succeed. The same way
a family raises and supports a growing child, a community of

65
00:07:25.750 --> 00:07:30.570
people can raise and support individuals who are motivated
to learn and grow.

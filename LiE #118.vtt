11
00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:44.050
Many of us have a deep desire to have stable, fulfilling relationships.

12
00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:48.640
But the sad reality is that most relationships are full of problems and misunderstandings.

13
00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:52.660
Maybe you've noticed repeating patterns in your romantic relationships.

14
00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:57.430
Maybe you've noticed that you keep ending up in the same situations, even with different people.

15
00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:00.380
Or perhaps you keep attracting the same type of person.

16
00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:02.850
Maybe you've found yourself wondering,

17
00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:07.390
Why is it so hard to cultivate and maintain a healthy, fulfilling relationship?

18
00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.800
Well, the bad news is that there isn't really a black and white answer to that question.

19
00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:16.450
However, the good news is that a psychologist named John Bowlby and his theory of attachment

20
00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:21.320
Have helped us to understand that almost all of the challenges of relationships start when we're children,

21
00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:25.830
And they're directly connected to the quality of maternal care that we received growing up.

22
00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:30.710
But before I tell you about the attachment theory, let me tell you a little bit about John Bowlby.

23
00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:36.200
John Bowlby was born in 1907 to an upper-middle-class family in London, England.

24
00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:39.460
His parents, like many other upper-class parents at the time,

25
00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:42.910
Believed that too much parental affection and attention would spoil a child,

26
00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:45.860
So they typically only spent about an hour with him each day.

27
00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:50.460
Bowlby and his five siblings were in fact raised by a nanny named Minnie,

28
00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:53.370
Who acted as their mother figure and primary caregiver.

29
00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:58.460
Unfortunately, when John was almost four, Minnie ended up leaving the family.

30
00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:03.390
John would later describe the loss of his nanny as tragic as losing his actual mother.

31
00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:10.380
At the age of seven, Bowlby was sent off to a boarding school which was common for boys of his social status at the time.

32
00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:14.760
John described the experience as a terrible and traumatic time for him.

33
00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:19.160
He was even quoted saying that he wouldn't send a dog away to boarding school at age seven.

34
00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:24.380
These experiences had a major influence on the men he became and the path his life took.

35
00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:31.290
Bobby went on to study medicine, but after just two years decided that psychology was what truly interested him.

36
00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:34.680
He began to work with maladjusted and delinquent children,

37
00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:37.170
Which piqued his interest in developmental psychology.

38
00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:42.100
In 1951, while working as a consultant to the World Health Organization,

39
00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:45.950
John Bowlby wrote a report titled Maternal Care and Mental Health.

40
00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:50.990
In the report, he argued that lots of affection and attention don't spoil a child.

41
00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:58.460
In fact, these things are as necessary for the development of a child's personality as vitamin D is for the development of bones.

42
00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:03.100
He wrote, "The infant and the young child should experience a warm,

43
00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:08.790
Intimate and continuous relationship with his mother in which both find satisfaction and enjoyment."

44
00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:16.180
In his book Separation Anxiety, published in 1959, Bowlby talks about what happens when a child doesn't receive.

45
00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:22.210
Enough of this kind of parental care and his observations of the behavior of children who had been separated from their parents.

46
00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:28.260
If the parents aren't available and attentive enough, or if the child is separated from their parents for too long,

47
00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:31.500
They still want their parent's love, attention, and interest,

48
00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:34.490
But they feel that anything good could disappear at any moment.

49
00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:39.140
They need lots of reassurance from their parents, and if they don't get it, they get upset.

50
00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:45.590
They become emotionally unstable. They're filled with hope, and then despair, and then hope again.

51
00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:50.970
The child feels that they cannot depend on their primary caregiver to be there when they need them most.

52
00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:55.070
This is the pattern of what Bowlby called "anxious attachment".

53
00:03:56.310 --> 00:04:00.220
But separation or lack of attention from the parents may lead to another kind of problem.

54
00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:06.250
If a child is neglected or abused by the caregiver or even punished for relying on their caregiver,

55
00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:11.570
It's possible that the child could feel so alone and helpless that they become what Bowlby called 'detached'.

56
00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:16.220
They enter their own little world to protect themselves from everyone and everything around them,

57
00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:17.950
And they become cold and distant.

58
00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:23.740
They see things like love, affection, tenderness, and closeness as dangerous.

59
00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:27.280
Even if they're desperate for a hug or some reassuring words,

60
00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:30.910
Their fear of being vulnerable outweighs their desire for affection.

61
00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:34.260
This is what Bowlby called avoidant attachment.

62
00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:40.500
Another possibility is that the child's primary caregiver is emotionally inconsistent and unpredictable,

63
00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:45.890
And this creates a major problem because the caregiver becomes both a source of comfort and fear.

64
00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:50.810
When in the presence of their caregiver, the child feels afraid and wants to flee to safety,

65
00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:53.280
But their protector is the very person that scares them.

66
00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:59.740
The child constantly feels confused by his or her instinctive desires to feel loved and to protect his or herself.

67
00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:02.870
This results in a display of confusing behavior.

68
00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:07.690
The child may seem disoriented or dazed or mentally absent at times.

69
00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:10.280
They may avoid or resist their parents.

70
00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:16.770
They may avoid all social interaction in order to protect themselves from the same fear they feel when interacting with their parents.

71
00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:21.900
This pattern of behavior is what eventually became known as "disorganized attachment".

72
00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:28.480
And the final possibility is that the child's primary caregiver is both emotionally and physically available to them.

73
00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:34.740
By fulfilling their child's needs, being close and nurturing, and also allowing their child to explore the world,

74
00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:38.270
The parents instill a sense of self-confidence and trust in the child.

75
00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:42.770
The child knows that they're safe to do their own thing and at the same time,

76
00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:46.610
They'll always have a safe place to return and seek reassurance if something goes wrong.

77
00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.320
This is what Bowlby called "secure attachment".

78
00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:58.470
The main focus of Bowlby's research was on what happens to a child if there are too many difficulties in forming secure attachments.

79
00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:05.580
So in summary, attachment is defined as a lasting psychological connectedness between human beings.

80
00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:10.420
A human being's first attachment is often established during infancy with the primary caregiver.

81
00:06:10.420 --> 00:06:14.780
And because caregivers vary in their levels of sensitivity and responsiveness,

82
00:06:15.090 --> 00:06:17.850
Not all infants attach to their caregivers in the same way.

83
00:06:19.140 --> 00:06:23.300
Attachment styles are expectations people develop about relationships with others

84
00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:27.450
Based on the relationship they had with their primary caregiver when they were infants.

85
00:06:28.860 --> 00:06:31.460
Now, there are four distinct ways we attach to other adults.

86
00:06:32.030 --> 00:06:35.600
So let's understand each of them better by looking at some real-world examples.

87
00:06:36.790 --> 00:06:41.220
Number one, the anxious attachment, also referred to as preoccupied.

88
00:06:42.510 --> 00:06:44.240
Let's imagine a little girl named Olivia.

89
00:06:45.380 --> 00:06:48.960
Olivia's parents were loving, supportive people, and they were always there for her.

90
00:06:50.010 --> 00:06:52.790
But when Olivia was three years old, her parents got divorced.

91
00:06:53.770 --> 00:06:58.330
Olivia stayed with her mother, who had to work two jobs just to make ends meet and keep a roof over their heads.

92
00:06:59.030 --> 00:07:02.580
She had to work day and night and had little time to attend to her daughter's needs.

93
00:07:03.660 --> 00:07:07.140
Olivia had a really hard time coping with this new lack of love and attention.

94
00:07:07.880 --> 00:07:12.500
She felt that her mother started to act unpredictably and she became anxious about their relationship.

95
00:07:13.380 --> 00:07:16.090
This anxiety led Olivia to become very clingy.

96
00:07:17.090 --> 00:07:20.710
To get her mother's attention, she had to raise her emotional state and make a scene.

97
00:07:21.410 --> 00:07:24.140
She would scream and cry until she got a reaction out of her mother.

98
00:07:25.060 --> 00:07:29.710
When Olivia's mother would finally react in a more predictable way and give her the attention she wanted,

99
00:07:30.140 --> 00:07:33.010
Olivia would become ambivalent and she wouldn't show her true feelings.

100
00:07:34.150 --> 00:07:38.480
Now, as an adult, Olivia has formed the habit of romanticizing love and connection.

101
00:07:39.190 --> 00:07:43.470
It's easier for her to form a fantasy bond with someone instead of something based on reality.

102
00:07:44.390 --> 00:07:48.110
She's often attracted to people she feels she can save or people that can save her.

103
00:07:49.020 --> 00:07:53.790
She tends to think very highly of others, but she struggles with insecurities, a low self-esteem,

104
00:07:54.040 --> 00:07:56.230
And establishing a strong sense of self.

105
00:07:57.330 --> 00:08:00.630
Olivia is afraid of and in some cases, incapable of being alone.

106
00:08:01.920 --> 00:08:07.910
Her strong fear of being abandoned by her lover leads her to be very demanding, obsessive, clingy, and jealous.

107
00:08:08.680 --> 00:08:12.270
She's prone to overanalyzing situations, intense mood swings,

108
00:08:12.450 --> 00:08:15.890
And she often mistakes turbulent relationships for passionate ones.

109
00:08:17.130 --> 00:08:19.200
Olivia is very sensitive to her partner's needs,

110
00:08:19.400 --> 00:08:23.860
But she feels very anxious and insecure about her own worth and position in her relationship.

111
00:08:25.030 --> 00:08:28.960
When her lover rejects her or fails to attend to her needs, she blames herself,

112
00:08:28.960 --> 00:08:30.690
And she feels that she isn't worthy of love.

113
00:08:32.230 --> 00:08:36.150
Olivia is a highly emotional woman and is heavily dependent on others.

114
00:08:36.960 --> 00:08:40.810
She needs constant reassurance that she's loved worthy and good enough,

115
00:08:41.280 --> 00:08:45.690
And the presence of a lover feels like the remedy for her strong emotional needs.

116
00:08:47.940 --> 00:08:52.560
Number two, avoidant attachment, also referred to as dismissive.

117
00:08:54.220 --> 00:08:55.760
Let's imagine a little boy named Tyler.

118
00:08:56.880 --> 00:08:59.710
Tyler's mother died when he was very young, so he grew up with his father.

119
00:09:00.870 --> 00:09:04.850
Tyler's father loved him very much, but he believed that being a good father meant being strict.

120
00:09:05.420 --> 00:09:08.670
So Tyler's father tended to avoid showing emotion and intimacy.

121
00:09:09.650 --> 00:09:14.510
Whenever Tyler would express the need for closeness and affection, his dad would tell him to man up.

122
00:09:15.580 --> 00:09:19.450
Tyler's dad expected him to be independent, serious, and reserved.

123
00:09:20.570 --> 00:09:25.310
If Tyler showed too much emotion or he was too loud, his dad got angry and sometimes punitive.

124
00:09:26.200 --> 00:09:26.960
This scared Tyler.

125
00:09:27.740 --> 00:09:31.980
He learned that to avoid fear, he must avoid showing his feelings and expressing himself.

126
00:09:33.530 --> 00:09:37.110
Now, as an adult, Tyler is emotionally distant in his relationships.

127
00:09:37.980 --> 00:09:39.760
He's easygoing and fun to be around,

128
00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:43.480
But all of his social interactions and connections remain on a surface level.

129
00:09:44.700 --> 00:09:47.970
Tyler comes across as self-sufficient and independent.

130
00:09:48.870 --> 00:09:53.630
He doesn't rely on others for reassurance or emotional support. He feels he's in control.

131
00:09:54.820 --> 00:09:59.020
Although space is essential for two people to breathe and be themselves in any relationship,

132
00:09:59.350 --> 00:10:03.900
Tyler tends to seek space more frequently in order to avoid being vulnerable with his partner.

133
00:10:05.100 --> 00:10:08.720
If things in this relationship start to get serious, he closes himself off.

134
00:10:09.340 --> 00:10:11.580
He starts looking for a reason to end the relationship.

135
00:10:12.280 --> 00:10:16.830
He might start getting annoyed by his partner's behavior, habits, or even physical appearance.

136
00:10:16.830 --> 00:10:21.880
And this only makes it easier to distance himself from his partner and focus on other things.

137
00:10:22.860 --> 00:10:24.980
If at any point his partner threatens to leave him,

138
00:10:25.420 --> 00:10:27.830
He has the ability to shut down and pretend that he doesn't care.

139
00:10:28.590 --> 00:10:31.300
However, that extreme independence is an illusion.

140
00:10:32.340 --> 00:10:36.440
Tyler desperately wants to feel love, affection, and connection just like everyone else,

141
00:10:36.680 --> 00:10:40.050
But he refuses to open himself up because it's just too scary.

142
00:10:43.170 --> 00:10:48.450
Number three, disorganized attachment, also referred to as fearful-avoidant.

143
00:10:50.020 --> 00:10:51.350
Let's imagine a girl named Lisa.

144
00:10:52.370 --> 00:10:55.200
Both of Lisa's parents were overworked and always stressed.

145
00:10:56.070 --> 00:10:59.920
Her father had a narcissistic personality and her mother had bipolar depression.

146
00:11:00.810 --> 00:11:05.310
They were emotionally inconsistent, extremely aggressive, and sometimes even abusive.

147
00:11:06.430 --> 00:11:10.180
This caused Lisa to become afraid of the very people that were supposed to protect her.

148
00:11:11.320 --> 00:11:15.450
This problem completely disorganized her ideas about love and safety.

149
00:11:16.290 --> 00:11:20.060
She never knew what to expect from her parents, so she was always anxious and afraid around them.

150
00:11:20.780 --> 00:11:22.930
She didn't know how to behave or interact with anybody,

151
00:11:23.590 --> 00:11:29.020
So she learned to avoid social interactions altogether in order to avoid feeling that anxiety and fear.

152
00:11:30.340 --> 00:11:35.500
Now, as an adult, she experiences a problematic mixture of both anxious and avoidant attachment styles.

153
00:11:36.710 --> 00:11:39.590
Lisa lacks a coherent approach to forming relationships.

154
00:11:40.420 --> 00:11:43.740
She has a strong fear that the people closest to her are going to hurt her.

155
00:11:44.640 --> 00:11:48.980
She fears intimacy and avoids proximity even though she desperately wants it in her life.

156
00:11:50.290 --> 00:11:54.140
She fears being abandoned, but often lacks the ability to trust and rely on her partner.

157
00:11:55.370 --> 00:11:59.850
She deals with an internal conflict of wanting intimacy while simultaneously resisting it.

158
00:12:00.370 --> 00:12:05.470
And as a result, she usually experiences many emotional highs and lows in her relationships.

159
00:12:06.400 --> 00:12:09.700
She doesn't reject emotional intimacy. She's simply afraid of it.

160
00:12:10.480 --> 00:12:12.890
She tends to see her partner says unpredictable,

161
00:12:13.220 --> 00:12:16.600
And that unpredictability makes her extremely anxious and uncomfortable.

162
00:12:17.680 --> 00:12:21.290
She doesn't believe that her partners will love and support her the way she is.

163
00:12:22.590 --> 00:12:25.470
Lisa has a very poor self-image and a negative view of others.

164
00:12:26.510 --> 00:12:31.110
She naturally expects and waits for rejection, disappointment, and pain to come.

165
00:12:32.050 --> 00:12:36.840
She thinks these things are inevitable, and this mindset often leads to a form of self-sabotage.

166
00:12:37.640 --> 00:12:40.880
She anticipates the worst-case scenario and then behaves in a way that.

167
00:12:40.880 --> 00:12:44.930
Turns her imagination into her reality and ends relationships prematurely.

168
00:12:45.960 --> 00:12:48.680
She also tends to consciously choose partners that scare her,

169
00:12:49.170 --> 00:12:54.000
Which only confirms her belief that people are unpredictable and they can't be trusted. No matter what.

170
00:12:55.430 --> 00:12:59.790
Much like the dismissive-avoidant type, Lisa has very few close relationships.

171
00:13:02.450 --> 00:13:04.820
Number four, secure attachment.

172
00:13:06.230 --> 00:13:07.850
Let's imagine a little boy named Thomas.

173
00:13:08.760 --> 00:13:13.090
Thomas grew up in a loving family with his mom and dad, his two sisters, and his little brother.

174
00:13:14.270 --> 00:13:17.000
Thomas's mother was a very affectionate and nurturing woman.

175
00:13:17.900 --> 00:13:21.320
She was very protective of Thomas, but she wasn't overwhelming or intrusive.

176
00:13:22.200 --> 00:13:27.450
She gave Thomas the space and freedom to explore the world but stayed close enough so that he felt a sense of safety.

177
00:13:28.550 --> 00:13:33.460
Thomas felt confident knowing that he could always run back to his mom for security, warmth, and affection.

178
00:13:34.830 --> 00:13:37.120
Thomas's mother was very attentive to his needs.

179
00:13:37.880 --> 00:13:41.180
She fed him when he was hungry, and rocked him to sleep when he was tired,

180
00:13:41.180 --> 00:13:45.320
And she was there to comfort, soothe and reassure him when he was in distress.

181
00:13:46.320 --> 00:13:49.530
This taught Thomas that he would never be ignored in his time of need.

182
00:13:50.870 --> 00:13:54.560
Thomas's mother routinely expressed her joy and satisfaction with who he was.

183
00:13:55.460 --> 00:13:59.170
She made a point to recognize and mention all of the positive qualities he possessed.

184
00:13:59.670 --> 00:14:01.980
But she never tried to make him feel as if he were perfect,

185
00:14:02.250 --> 00:14:04.870
And whenever she would criticize him, she would do it constructively.

186
00:14:05.840 --> 00:14:08.740
This made Thomas feel valued and gave him a healthy self-esteem.

187
00:14:10.250 --> 00:14:15.210
Above all, Thomas's mother wasn't just loving and supportive, she was also consistent.

188
00:14:16.080 --> 00:14:22.090
Thomas was able to develop great trust in his mother because she showed him that she would always be there for him, no matter what.

189
00:14:23.340 --> 00:14:26.570
Now, as an adult, Thomas is a confident and optimistic man.

190
00:14:27.210 --> 00:14:32.900
He's grounded and goal-oriented. He's able to regulate his emotions and feelings in a relationship,

191
00:14:33.140 --> 00:14:35.790
And he has no problem opening up to and trusting others.

192
00:14:36.760 --> 00:14:41.350
He's aware of his emotional needs and isn't afraid to experience or express them to his partner.

193
00:14:42.480 --> 00:14:47.580
Thomas is level-headed and doesn't feel the need to exaggerate or go to extremes when expressing himself.

194
00:14:48.710 --> 00:14:52.820
He's capable of and tries to build and maintain long-lasting relationships,

195
00:14:53.030 --> 00:14:55.410
And at the same time, he has no problem being alone.

196
00:14:56.390 --> 00:14:59.810
Thomas neither demands intimacy and affection nor rejects them.

197
00:15:00.820 --> 00:15:02.050
He's a very understanding man,

198
00:15:02.050 --> 00:15:05.250
And he gives his partner the benefit of the doubt when interpreting their behavior.

199
00:15:05.270 --> 00:15:08.620
If there's a problem, he finds a way to work it out.

200
00:15:09.570 --> 00:15:13.980
If his lover is feeling sad or confused or just being annoying, he doesn't overreact.

201
00:15:14.710 --> 00:15:18.040
And at moments when his partner is unavailable, he can take care of himself.

202
00:15:19.540 --> 00:15:22.860
Thomas's childhood wasn't perfect, but he looks back on it fondly.

203
00:15:23.820 --> 00:15:28.310
By being raised in a healthy environment with loving, supportive and consistent parents.

204
00:15:28.620 --> 00:15:33.030
Thomas learned to appreciate the good and to understand and move on from the bad.

205
00:15:34.620 --> 00:15:37.740
So tell me which one of these people sounds like you?

206
00:15:38.890 --> 00:15:41.590
By diving deeper into your past or that of your partner,

207
00:15:41.880 --> 00:15:47.120
You can begin to understand and appreciate the fact that the motives for your behavior aren't always what they seem.

208
00:15:47.520 --> 00:15:49.040
And that although it might be difficult,

209
00:15:49.330 --> 00:15:55.090
There is a way to cultivate and maintain healthier, happier, more fulfilling relationships.

210
00:15:56.520 --> 00:15:57.500
This is Life in English.

211
00:15:57.790 --> 00:16:00.220
I'm your host, Tony Kaizen, and I'll talk to you later.

212
00:16:01.070 --> 00:16:01.350
Peace.

00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:10.050
The point is: the key to fluency is self-awareness. A lot of
people come to

2
00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:15.720
me saying that they want to learn English but they just
don't know what to do. Should I pay for a course? Should I

3
00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:23.160
take private classes? Should I do it by myself? Can I do it
by myself? Should I watch TV series, listen to music, read

4
00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:30.660
books? What should I do? How do I learn the language? This
is why so many people never start learning English or they

5
00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:36.910
quit before they can see any real progress. This is also the
reason that some people are making a ridiculous amount of

6
00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:44.740
money selling people this illusion that they have some super
secret revolutionary way of getting to fluency and they can

7
00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:52.670
get you there faster than anyone else. But the real key to
fluency in any language --the real key to success in

8
00:00:52.670 --> 00:01:00.680
anything-- is self-awareness. So before you take on a
difficult, time-consuming task like learning a language, you

9
00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:07.980
need to know who you are, how your brain works, what you
enjoy doing and what you hate doing. Because all of these

10
00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:14.120
things are going to help you determine how to approach
learning this language. There's no one size fits all

11
00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:21.070
approach to learning a language. We're all different, so
what works for me might not work for you and vice versa.

12
00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:26.560
That's why it kind of makes me laugh when I see the
Instagram ad or something and some guy saying, you know,

13
00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:34.720
"You'll be fluent in six months if you just follow my super
special revolutionary formula for fluency." It's bullshit.

14
00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:41.730
It's bullshit. There are no secrets. There's no hacks. You
don't have to do anything differently than the way you did

15
00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:50.040
it the first time you had to learn a language. That's it.
And I say that so consistently and so confidently because

16
00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:56.190
I'm living proof of that. I learned two foreign languages
without having to leave my house, you see what I'm saying?

17
00:01:56.300 --> 00:02:02.110
And I'm gonna learn three more. I could learn six more if I
wanted to, and so could you, that's the point. If I can do

18
00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:10.680
it, you can do it, your mom can do it, your friends can do
it... we can all do it. The question is, how do you learn?

19
00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:18.140
That's the question here. Do you prefer to watch videos or
listen to podcasts? Do you prefer to read books or do you

20
00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:24.770
prefer to write things? Are you interested in sports or
makeup and jewelry? What about music or traveling or

21
00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:30.980
politics or food? You need to know what interests you
because these are the things you're gonna use to help you

22
00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:36.650
learn this new thing. For example, I don't like fiction
books. I don't like fake stories, things that didn't really

23
00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:44.110
happen, fantasy characters and things of that nature. I like
non-fiction, like psychology, philosophy, business, finance,

24
00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:49.940
investing, things like that. So I would never use
non-fiction (fiction) books to try and learn a new language,

25
00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:56.710
you see what I'm saying? I like football, so I would watch
football from another country and another language and take

26
00:02:56.710 --> 00:03:01.910
notes, pick up on the terminology, the words and
expressions, the way that they speak, the way that they

27
00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:07.890
speak about the game, names of players, try to learn more
about the culture and the history of those clubs because

28
00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:13.570
that's interesting to me naturally, even in my own native
language. So I would use that to learn the foreign language.

29
00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:21.200
I wouldn't be watching tennis or volleyball or rugby or
something like that because I'm not interested in those

30
00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:28.140
things. Now, I will say once I get up to a certain level,
like intermediate, for example, I can understand a lot of

31
00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:33.800
stuff, I can express myself and things like that. Or even
when I get past that to where I'm confident I can speak this

32
00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:39.700
language, I can understand this language, then it is time to
start going into areas that I'm not interested in or that I

33
00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:45.620
know nothing about, because that's only gonna increase my
vocabulary, my understanding of other people, different

34
00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:50.750
cultures, different activities and things like that, which
will help me speak the language better, understand the

35
00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:57.740
language better, and also have better conversations because
I know a little bit about a lot. So it gets a point in any

36
00:03:57.740 --> 00:04:04.190
language, even your native language, where it pays, it's
very beneficial, it's very useful to know a little bit about

37
00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:09.090
a lot of things, even if you're not interested at all in
those things. Because at the end of the day, what are we

38
00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:16.040
using this language for? To communicate, right? To have
conversations, to make connections. So if you only know and

39
00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:23.090
if you can only talk about what you're interested in, you
know, you're really closing a lot of doors of opportunity in

40
00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:27.900
your life and in your world, you know what I'm saying? But
if you can just know a little bit about a bunch of different

41
00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:33.520
subjects, you can talk to anybody, any time. And you never
know where that conversation is gonna lead, you see what I'm

42
00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:40.640
saying? But anyway, back to the subject. What about your
teacher? What type of teacher are you looking for? What type

43
00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:46.670
of classes are you looking for? Do you prefer a one-on-one
private class? Do you prefer the idea of a small group class

44
00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:52.090
with a few other students? What about your teacher? Do you
prefer somebody that's gonna force you outside your comfort

45
00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:59.120
zone and push you to the limit every single class? Or do you
prefer a teacher that's gonna be laid-back and let you do

46
00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:07.010
things in your time and be patient and let you slowly come
out of your comfort zone? You need to know that, right? And

47
00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:13.150
what type of student are you? Do you like doing homework
assignments every day, or do you find that super boring and

48
00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:19.280
unhelpful? Do you prefer just to talk the entire class, or
would you like something that's prepared and more formal and

49
00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:25.230
structured? Do you want to be corrected every single time
you make a mistake? Or would you prefer that your teacher

50
00:05:25.230 --> 00:05:30.740
let you finish your thought before he says anything about
the mistakes that you made and how you could say things

51
00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:36.250
differently? These are things that you need to consider to
get the best experience out of your classes and to get the

52
00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:43.500
most progress out of your process. You also need to know
what type of person you are. Do you get bored easily? Or is

53
00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:49.940
it easy for you to maintain your interest in one thing for
very long periods of time? Do you quit things easily or are

54
00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:56.500
you truly dedicated to this mission that you have, which is
fluency in this language? Are you constantly trying to learn

55
00:05:56.500 --> 00:06:01.960
new things? Because that's a characteristic that you need to
have if you're gonna learn something like a language. You

56
00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:07.410
constantly have to be trying to learn new things, looking
for new words and phrases and expressions, not just random

57
00:06:07.410 --> 00:06:12.460
stuff, but every day you need to be increasing your
knowledge, practicing your skills and learning new things.

58
00:06:13.010 --> 00:06:18.960
And how much money do you have? Can you really afford to pay
a thousand dollars for some course without any real

59
00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:26.550
guarantee that it's gonna help you become fluent faster or
more effectively? Do you really need to take private classes

60
00:06:26.790 --> 00:06:32.070
or could you just find a language partner? Do you have the
money for private classes? How often do you want to have

61
00:06:32.070 --> 00:06:40.750
class? How much can you pay and why? The point is: the key
to fluency is self-awareness. You need to know who you are

62
00:06:41.100 --> 00:06:45.930
and how your brain works in order to do things that will
increase the chances that you stay committed to your mission

63
00:06:46.270 --> 00:06:52.250
and that you actually make progress. Most people set
themselves up for failure because they never take the time

64
00:06:52.510 --> 00:06:57.730
to understand themselves and then they try to do things that
don't come naturally to them. If they would simply change

65
00:06:57.780 --> 00:07:04.200
their strategy, they would be successful. But instead they
waste their time blaming everyone and everything else for

66
00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:11.470
their own failures. "It's the teacher, he's terrible." "It
was that course, it was trash." "It was my school." "It's my

67
00:07:11.500 --> 00:07:17.900
education." "It's my government, it's my parents, it's my
friends." "I'm not good enough. I'm stupid. It's not for

68
00:07:17.900 --> 00:07:26.620
me." "I don't want to." Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
(laughs) Don't be like the 95% of people who will waste

69
00:07:26.620 --> 00:07:29.050
their lives making excuses.

70
00:07:30.040 --> 00:07:37.150
Take the time to get to know yourself and understand what it
is that you need in order to thrive and be successful. I

71
00:07:37.150 --> 00:07:43.380
have no doubt that it will help you achieve everything you
want in life, including being fluent in

72
00:07:49.040 --> 00:07:49.370
English.

00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:00.890
What's up, everybody?

2
00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:03.270
You are listening to another episode of Life in English.

3
00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:04.690
I'm your host, Tony Kaizen.

4
00:00:04.690 --> 00:00:10.070
And in this episode, I'm going to talk about the idea that you need to be talking to native English speakers

5
00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:12.880
If you want to become fluent and whether it's true or not.

6
00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:15.850
Spoiler alert, it's not true.

7
00:00:16.210 --> 00:00:18.990
But keep listening to hear me talk all about it.

8
00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:20.510
Roll the intro.

Now, I want to start this episode by giving a big shout-out to my man, Daniel PÃ©rez.

16

So Daniel, thank you so much for being a part of the community.

19
00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:11.040
He was actually the first one to join the community, by the way. You know?

20
00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:16.080
The very first member of the Life in English community and hopefully the first of many more to come.

21
00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:22.180
But anyway, let's get to the meat and potatoes or the real idea, the real content of this episode.

22
00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:28.590
You know, a lot of people around the world believe the only way to improve their English is by speaking with native English speakers.

23
00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:34.530
They refuse to practice their English with people from another country or with other non-native speakers.

24
00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:39.520
Now, obviously, if you're one of these people and that's what you believe, You have every right to believe that.

25
00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:42.160
But let me challenge you to think about a few things,

26
00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:46.540
And maybe you'll see that this mentality could be slowing you down on your journey.

27
00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:53.920
So the first thing I want you to consider is that natives generally have less time than other English learners.

28
00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:58.750
The number of people around the world who are learning English as a foreign language is staggering.

29
00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:03.160
We're talking hundreds of millions, maybe even billions of people.

30
00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:08.010
But what about the amount of English speakers actively trying to learn a foreign language?

31
00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:13.960
I really don't know what the number is, but in my experience here in the U.S., it's relatively low.

32
00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:15.700
So what does that mean?

33
00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:20.510
That means that there's a high demand for native English speakers who are actively

34
00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:23.420
Looking to do a language exchange With someone who speaks a foreign language.

35
00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:27.840
Why? Because the supply of this type of person is so low.

36
00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:33.030
There simply are not enough native speakers or native English speakers for everyone.

37
00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:39.170
And there's a low demand for non-English speakers who are actively looking to do a language exchange.

38
00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:42.840
Why? Because there are over a billion of them.

39
00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:49.650
There's enough supply for every native English speaker on this planet to have a native language exchange partner.

40
00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:51.950
So what are you left with?

41
00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:59.020
The relatively few native speakers who are not only interested in learning your language but also have the time,

42
00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:04.520
Energy, patience, and dedication to learn and practice with you consistently over months or years of time.

43
00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:08.580
The number of people who fit into that category is discouragingly low.

44
00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:15.480
Then you have private English teachers who will give you weekly classes in exchange for an hourly fee. Right?

45
00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:20.030
But most people can't afford to pay a private teacher every week for many reasons.

46
00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:25.730
They don't make enough money or their national currency is much weaker than the currency in most English-speaking countries.

47
00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:28.210
Or maybe they just can't find a teacher they identify with.

48
00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:31.160
So if we go back to my initial statement,

49
00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:35.900
There are a lot more people learning English than there are native English speakers learning a foreign language.

50
00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:39.160
And of that group of English speakers learning a foreign language,

51
00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:41.300
They're all learning different foreign languages,

52
00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:46.170
Which just lowers the chances that you'll find one to practice with you on a regular basis.

53
00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:53.330
Now, think about that group of people learning English. That group of over one billion people.

54
00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:57.850
You got to think at least 1% of that group speaks the same language as you,

55
00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:01.720
Or has the same schedule as you or has the same interests as you,

56
00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:04.000
Or has the same desire to learn English that you have.

57
00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:09.550
We all know how difficult it can be to find a quality language exchange partner.

58
00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:16.140
So all I'm saying is that you might be making it even harder by refusing to practice your English with non-native speakers.

59
00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:23.800
So the second thing I want you to consider is that everyone knows something you don't.

60
00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:30.810
To think that you can only learn new things about English from native English speakers is the same thinG

61
00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:36.250
As thinking you can only learn how to play soccer by studying with someone who has been playing since the day they were born.

62
00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:41.810
To think that you can only learn things from a teacher is fine. That's a valid opinion.

63
00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:44.270
But we've got to remember, everyone is a teacher.

64
00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:51.640
Men, women, adults, children, bus drivers, artists, politicians, librarians, they're all teachers.

65
00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:54.390
And what exactly is the teacher anyway?

66
00:04:54.390 --> 00:04:58.820
It's someone who has the necessary experience, time,

67
00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:03.100
And patience to help you learn something new and that can literally be any one of us.

68
00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:07.620
Do all of us learn how to cook in a school with instructors?

69
00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:12.400
No, our parents teach us or we learn by experimenting.

70
00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:18.420
Nowadays, you can actually go find tutorials online for free from regular people like you and me.

71
00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:23.580
And do all of us learn how to fight with professional MMA instructors?

72
00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:27.400
No, most people learn fighting at school or in the streets.

73
00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:31.010
And even the best, most experienced fighters get knocked on their ass from time to time.

74
00:05:31.010 --> 00:05:33.860
Do you think they don't have more to learn?

75
00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:36.960
And who are they going to learn it from if they're the best?

76
00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:42.340
Do all of us learn how to have sex by taking some course with a licensed professional?

77
00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:43.910
No, of course not.

78
00:05:43.910 --> 00:05:48.110
Most of us learn by watching other people have sex and then experimenting with our partners. Right?

79
00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:51.930
Now, maybe these aren't the best examples, but hopefully, you can see my point.

80
00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:58.440
So many of the skills you have at your disposal were not taught to you by some licensed professional with decades of experience.

81
00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:02.460
They were taught to you by someone who simply had more experience than you.

82
00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:04.580
And it's the same for language.

83
00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:09.470
There are plenty of native English speakers who don't speak perfect or grammatically correct English,

84
00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:13.100
And there are plenty of natives who couldn't explain how things work in their language.

85
00:06:13.390 --> 00:06:17.610
But there are a bunch of non-natives who can, and some of them speak your native language.

86
00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:21.800
So don't underestimate the power of learning from other students,

87
00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:24.740
Because sometimes they understand you more than your teachers do.

88
00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:28.820
And approaching people with the mindset that you have absolutely nothing

89
00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:33.310
To learn from them will Only guarantee that you learn absolutely nothing from anyone.

90
00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:43.500
So the third and final thing I want you to consider is that in reality, in real life,

91
00:06:43.620 --> 00:06:49.340
You're going to be speaking English with all kinds of people, not just native speakers.

92
00:06:50.530 --> 00:06:57.390
And we've already talked about the fact that there are over one billion people learning English as a foreign language or as a second language.

93
00:06:58.540 --> 00:07:01.520
There are more people learning English than there are native English speakers.

94
00:07:02.970 --> 00:07:08.120
That means eventually you'll find yourself in a situation where someone who speaks English as a foreign language

95
00:07:08.370 --> 00:07:13.720
With an accent completely different from yours or mine, and you'll still need to be able to communicate with this person.

96
00:07:15.540 --> 00:07:18.170
And how do we learn to understand certain accents or dialects?

97
00:07:19.430 --> 00:07:26.600
We listen to them. A lot. We talk to people who use that accent or dialect a lot.

98
00:07:27.810 --> 00:07:30.760
So another important reason to practice your English with non-native speakers is

99
00:07:30.760 --> 00:07:34.120
Because your chances of having to communicate with them are so high.

100
00:07:35.520 --> 00:07:40.020
Even in an English-speaking country, there are typically hundreds of thousands, or in the case of the U.S.,

101
00:07:40.300 --> 00:07:43.120
Millions of people who speak English as a second language.

102
00:07:43.610 --> 00:07:47.810
And you need to be able to understand them just as much as you need to understand a native speaker. Right?

103
00:07:47.810 --> 00:07:54.120
And this also gives you a chance to get exposed to different cultures and ways of life while you're improving your English.

104
00:07:55.110 --> 00:08:00.160
You can end up making friends all over the world because you all speak this language that unites you. You know?

105
00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:02.370
And there's really no telling where that connection could go.

106
00:08:04.370 --> 00:08:10.080
So if you're one of those people that believe you should only practice your English with native English speakers,

107
00:08:10.910 --> 00:08:12.880
What do you think after hearing this episode?

108
00:08:14.570 --> 00:08:17.450
I hope that you can at least see the reason in what I'm saying.

109
00:08:18.820 --> 00:08:22.580
The idea that you can only learn with natives or professionals is simply false,

110
00:08:23.020 --> 00:08:26.590
And it'll keep you from making not only progress but possibly friends and money as well.

111
00:08:27.810 --> 00:08:30.750
So I hope this message serves as an inspiration for you to get out there

112
00:08:30.750 --> 00:08:33.350
And find some language exchange partners to practice your English with,

113
00:08:33.850 --> 00:08:36.110
Even if those partners are not native speakers.

114
00:08:36.820 --> 00:08:39.910
Now, if you'd like to join a growing community of quality language exchange partners,

115
00:08:39.910 --> 00:08:43.970

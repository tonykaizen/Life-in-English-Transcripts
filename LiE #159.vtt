00:00:01.130 --> 00:00:06.820
What's up, everybody? This is the Life in English podcast.
I'm your host, Tony Kaizen, and it's been a while since I've

2
00:00:06.820 --> 00:00:14.430
broken down the lyrics of a good song, so I figured I'd do a
few episodes using music to teach you English. So today, I'm

3
00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:20.670
going to explain the first verse of a song by the late,
great, and legendary hip-hop artist, Nipsey Hussle, from Los

4
00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:26.470
Angeles, California. Now, the name of this song is I Don't
Give a Fucc, and the word "fuck" in this case is spelled

5
00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:32.670
with two Cs because he was a Rollin' 60s Crip. But don't
worry about that for now. I'll explain that in more detail

6
00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:38.940
later. So this song, I Don't Give a Fucc, it's from The
Marathon mixtape that he released back in 2010, but I'm

7
00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:45.330
still bumping this song to this day. Now I'm only going to
explain the chorus and the first verse of the song in this

8
00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:51.720
episode, but I'll leave a link to the complete mixtape in
the description of this episode, as well as on the music

9
00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:57.880
channel of the Discord server. So let's not waste any time,
my friends. I'm gonna play the song once and then we'll go

10
00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:04.340
back and analyze it line by line so I can teach you all
about that Los Angeles slanguage. And just so you know, the

11
00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:10.900
word "slanguage" is not really like, an accepted word.
You're not going to find it in a dictionary. Most people

12
00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:16.060
probably couldn't explain it to you, but I heard the rapper
E-40 say it. That was the first person I heard, used the

13
00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:22.390
word "slanguage". And it's just a mixture of the words,
"slang" and "language", you know? You'll find that natives

14
00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:27.430
we...we play with the language a lot and say things that
don't make literal sense, but they make perfect sense, you

15
00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:29.430
know, to us.

16
00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:34.490
Anyway...anyway, let's get into the song, man. Let's not
waste no more time. I'm going to play it now.

17
00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:50.390
Nipsey Hussle:
"I don't give a fuck.

18
00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:02.920
Ridin' with my burner and my beat turned up.

19
00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:11.240
AC blowin' and my window down. Chuckin' up my hood when I
hit yo town. I don't give a fuck.

20
00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:18.710
Ridin' with my burner and my beat turned up. AC blowin' and
my window down. Chuckin' up my hood when I hit yo town.

21
00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:25.100
Look, my mama wanna know why I'm bangin'. She told me I'ma
lose my life. I ain't trippin', I'm a Crip and I'ma do it

22
00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:31.750
right. 'Fore I run from a nigga, I'll lose the fight. I
gotta hustle, mama, I'ma move the white. If I died and came

23
00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:38.410
back, I'd do it twice. Brainwashed by the block, it consumed
my life. Cool nigga but a killa when the mood is right.

24
00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:44.430
Bullets have the dogs howlin' at the moon at night. Mama,
it's cold outside, ain't no hope outside. Couple niggas

25
00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:50.680
gettin' money, most is broke outside. Rocks in the house,
sellin' dope outside. Reminiscin' on my niggas that got

26
00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:57.840
smoked outside. Suckas in the house when them locs outside.
Hustla gotta eat when them folks outside. Got a burner on my

27
00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:04.290
lap and I'm dippin' in my bucket. Life's a bitch, nigga,
fuck it. I don't give a fuck. Ridin' with my burner and my

28
00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:12.830
beat turned up. AC blowin' and my window down. Chuckin' up
my hood when I hit yo town. I don't give a fuck. Ridin' with

29
00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:15.970
my burner and my beat turned up.

30
00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:22.590
AC blowin' and my window down. Chuckin' up my hood when I
hit yo town. Ch'yeah. They say we probably die slangin',

31
00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:24.250
bangin', pressin' the line."

32
00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:30.290
Alright, ladies and gents, do not feel bad if you could not
understand everything that was being said, there was a lot

33
00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:36.230
of slang going on and maybe the audio wasn't so clear. There
might be a bunch of reasons you couldn't understand

34
00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:43.310
everything. But now, we're gonna go back and analyze the
chorus and the first verse line by line to make sure you

35
00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:49.200
understand every single letter of every single word. So
let's start with the chorus.

36
00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:54.990
"I don't give a fuck.

37
00:03:54.990 --> 00:04:02.460
Ridin' with my burner and my beat turned up. AC blowin' and
my window down. Chuckin' up my hood when I hit yo town."

38
00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:13.040
"I don't give a fuck. Ridin' with my burner and my beat
turned up. AC blowin' and my window down. Chuckin' up my

39
00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:22.400
hood when I hit yo town." So, "I don't give a fuck". It's
just a very, you know, strong and rude way of saying, "I

40
00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:27.910
don't care". It's a very strong, intense...some people would
say, vulgar way of saying that, "I just don't care". "I

41
00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:35.090
don't give a fuck", right? Now, to "ride with my burner". In
this case, the word "ride" just means to travel around in

42
00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:40.500
your car. So if you're riding in your car, you're just in
the car or traveling somewhere, or you're riding your bike

43
00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:46.440
or you're riding your motorcycle or riding your skateboard,
you're just riding. It means you're on this vehicle or in

44
00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:53.790
this vehicle and traveling somewhere. Okay? Now, "burner" is
a word...it's like slang for "gun". So he's saying, "I'm

45
00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:59.360
riding with my gun and my beat turned up." And that's the
last thing I wanted to explain from that line is 'turned

46
00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:05.970
up". In this case, it just means "loud" because when we're
talking about music, he said, "my beat turned up". He means

47
00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:13.250
"my music", the "music in my car". So if it's "turned up",
he's referring to the volume of the music. So we would say,

48
00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:21.670
"turn the music down" or "turn the volume down" to reduce
the level of sound to make it less loud, more quiet, you get

49
00:05:21.670 --> 00:05:27.840
the idea. And we turn the volume up to make the music
louder. So if "my beat turned up when I'm riding around

50
00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:33.730
town", the picture he's trying to paint for you is he's in
his car riding around the city. He's got his gun in his car

51
00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:41.770
and his music is loud. That's what you should understand. 
And the next line is "AC blowin' and my window down". So AC

52
00:05:41.770 --> 00:05:49.000
is air conditioner. It's that machine in our cars and houses
that makes it cooler in the room. So "blowin'" just refers

53
00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:57.350
to the air that literally blows out of the vent in the car.
So "my AC is blowing and my window down", which literally

54
00:05:57.350 --> 00:06:04.380
just means the window in my car is rolled down. It's open.
You see what I'm saying? Last is "chuckin' up my hood when I

55
00:06:04.380 --> 00:06:10.170
hit your town". Now "chucking", to chuck something is like
another way of saying to throw something. You throw it

56
00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:13.360
really hard, a far distance.

57
00:06:13.390 --> 00:06:21.580
Just, you just chuck it. But when he says, "Chuckin' up my
hood", how can I explain it to you? You could also say,

58
00:06:21.610 --> 00:06:27.540
"throw up my hood". Maybe this will help you understand. And
this is referring to things that...it's a part of gang

59
00:06:27.540 --> 00:06:32.960
culture. I'm not sure if you're familiar with what gangs
are, but they're like, I guess it depends on how you wanna

60
00:06:33.460 --> 00:06:41.240
look at it, the definition changes. But think of it as a
community or a neighborhood organization that's typically

61
00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:48.880
involved in some type of crime. I guess in the past they
existed to protect their communities, but now they've become

62
00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:55.820
synonymous with like, organized crime, drug dealing, violent
attacks, violent crimes, and things of that nature...armed

63
00:06:55.820 --> 00:07:01.280
robbery, you know. They have rivals. So you might have like,
the Bloods on one side of the city, one gang might call

64
00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:06.810
themselves the "Bloods". On the other side of the city, the
other gang might call themselves the "Crips". And these two

65
00:07:06.810 --> 00:07:11.750
gangs are rivals. They're always fighting with each other,
killing each other, robbing each other. I mean, they're just

66
00:07:11.750 --> 00:07:19.620
enemies. Enemies. So that's what he's referring to. So in
gang culture, to throw up your hood or to...to chuck up your

67
00:07:19.620 --> 00:07:26.150
hood, you literally lift your hands in the air and you make
signs with your fingers. Particular signs that represent

68
00:07:26.150 --> 00:07:32.500
your gang that let people know what gang you claim, what
neighborhood you're from, who you represent. You see what

69
00:07:32.500 --> 00:07:38.950
I'm saying? So if he's "chucking up his hood when when he
hits your town", which is the rest of the line, he's saying,

70
00:07:38.950 --> 00:07:44.870
"When I arrive in your city...", so if "I hit your town",
that means "I just arrived in your city". And when I arrive

71
00:07:44.870 --> 00:07:50.510
in your city, I'm chucking up my hood. I'm letting everybody
here know where I'm from. That's the idea. He's trying to

72
00:07:50.510 --> 00:07:56.280
paint you a picture and describe, like, his lifestyle. So I
don't give a fuck about nothing. I'm riding around in the

73
00:07:56.280 --> 00:08:02.410
city. My gun, in my car, my music is loud, the AC is
blowing, the windows are down and I'm chucking up my hood

74
00:08:02.500 --> 00:08:08.520
when I hit your town, let you know where I'm from, who I am,
and what I represent. That's what he's saying. That's what I

75
00:08:08.520 --> 00:08:11.720
understand at least, okay? So let's hear it one more time.

76
00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:17.880
"I don't give a fuck.

77
00:08:17.880 --> 00:08:25.350
Ridin' with my burner and my beat turned up. AC blowin' and
my window down. Chuckin' up my hood when I hit yo town."

78
00:08:27.980 --> 00:08:32.560
Alright, my friend. Now it's time to take a look at verse
one. We're gonna go through...and I'll do probably two or

79
00:08:32.560 --> 00:08:37.830
three lines at a time just because of the way the song is
written. It's easier to explain the ideas that way,

80
00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:40.280
alright? So let's start with the first couple of lines.

81
00:08:43.540 --> 00:08:49.700
"My mama wanna know why I'm bangin'. She told me I'ma lose
my life. I ain't trippin', I'm a Crip and I'ma do it right."

82
00:08:51.680 --> 00:08:58.050
So the first line, what he's saying is "my mother wants to
know why I'm involved in violent and illegal gang activity",

83
00:08:58.340 --> 00:09:04.960
because to "gangbang" means "to participate in gang
activity". A lot of times it's selling drugs, violent

84
00:09:04.960 --> 00:09:11.240
crimes, armed robbery, all types of wild stuff, right? So
his mother is like, "Why are you doing this?" "My mom wants

85
00:09:11.240 --> 00:09:16.990
to know why I'm involved in this type of activity and she's
telling me I'm gonna lose my life", which is another way of

86
00:09:16.990 --> 00:09:23.760
saying, "She's telling me I'm gonna get killed if I keep
involving myself in these illegal and violent criminal

87
00:09:23.760 --> 00:09:26.510
activities". Alright, next line.

88
00:09:27.660 --> 00:09:35.410
"I ain't trippin', I'm a Crip and I'ma do it right".
Alright, the first thing. "I ain't trippin'" so "I ain't

89
00:09:35.410 --> 00:09:40.950
trippin'", it's just a really informal way of saying "I'm
not worried about it". So if I say, "I ain't trippin about

90
00:09:40.950 --> 00:09:46.590
that", it means "I'm not worried about that. It doesn't
bother me. I'm not thinking about it. It is what it is." So

91
00:09:46.590 --> 00:09:53.030
when he says "I'm a Crip and I'ma do it right", he's saying,
"This is the gang I represent. I am a Crip, I represent the

92
00:09:53.030 --> 00:09:59.390
Rollin' 60s Crip gang, and I'ma do it right", which means
"I'm going to respect the code of my organization" because

93
00:09:59.390 --> 00:10:05.100
gangs, they typically have codes and rules and regulations,
things that you can do and you cannot do, you know, they

94
00:10:05.100 --> 00:10:11.200
just have their way of doing things, right? So he's saying,
"I've chosen this life for myself, it is what it is. I'm a

95
00:10:11.200 --> 00:10:18.080
Crip. I joined the gang, I'ma represent and do it right. I'm
gonna follow the code," or "respect the code", I should say.

96
00:10:18.420 --> 00:10:23.930
So "whatever my gang calls on me to do, whatever
responsibilities I have as a Crip gang member, I'm going to,

97
00:10:24.290 --> 00:10:28.680
you know, take care of my responsibilities." That's
basically what he's communicating, at least to me. You see?

98
00:10:30.100 --> 00:10:30.740
Alright, next line.

99
00:10:33.250 --> 00:10:38.090
"'Fore I run from a nigga, I'll lose the fight. I gotta
hustle, mama, I'ma move the white"

100
00:10:40.060 --> 00:10:48.370
So in the next line, he says, "'Fore I run from a nigga,
I'll lose the fight." And apostrophe f-o-r-e is just a

101
00:10:48.370 --> 00:10:55.740
really informal way of shortening the word "before". So when
he says, "'Fore I run from a nigga", he's saying, "Before I

102
00:10:55.740 --> 00:11:02.680
run from a nigga, I'll lose the fight." And what he's
communicating is like, "I would never run away from someone

103
00:11:02.680 --> 00:11:08.430
who wants to fight me or hurt me. I will lose a fight before
that happens." You see what I'm saying? "I would rather lose

104
00:11:08.430 --> 00:11:14.960
the fight than run away like a coward." That's the idea. In
the next line, he says, "I gotta hustle, mama, I'ma move the

105
00:11:14.960 --> 00:11:22.940
white." So to "hustle" is like, to make money fast, to work
really hard to make money really fast. So he's saying, "I've

106
00:11:22.940 --> 00:11:29.100
got to find a way to make money quickly." And he's talking
to his mom. He's saying, "Mama, I'ma move the white" and

107
00:11:29.100 --> 00:11:36.050
that's like slang for selling cocaine. You see what I'm
saying? So "I got to hustle, Mama, I'ma move the white." "I

108
00:11:36.050 --> 00:11:41.820
got to make money quick. So I'ma sell this cocaine. That's
what I'ma do." That's the idea. Alright, next lines.

109
00:11:44.310 --> 00:11:49.320
"If I died and came back, I'd do it twice. Brainwashed by
the block, it consumed my life."

110
00:11:50.680 --> 00:11:59.270
"If I died and came back, I'd do it twice. Brainwashed by
the block, it consumed my life." So that first line, when he

111
00:11:59.270 --> 00:12:07.090
says, "if I died and came back", that's just a natural way
of saying "if I died and was born again," basically, "if I

112
00:12:07.090 --> 00:12:13.330
had to do all of this over again, I would do it the exact
same way." That's what he means when I...when he says, "if I

113
00:12:13.330 --> 00:12:19.880
died and came back, I'd do it twice." Then he says,
"brainwashed by the block, it consumed my life." So what

114
00:12:19.880 --> 00:12:24.480
he's communicating is he was, you know, kind of brainwashed
by the other thugs and gang members in his neighborhood and

115
00:12:24.480 --> 00:12:32.290
he became this militant soldier ready to do whatever for his
gang, no matter how violent or horrific or anything like

116
00:12:32.320 --> 00:12:37.300
that. He was just brainwashed. He wasn't thinking for
himself anymore and he allowed that lifestyle to consume

117
00:12:37.480 --> 00:12:42.470
him. It became his whole world, you know what I'm saying?
Alright, next lines.

118
00:12:45.230 --> 00:12:50.260
"Cool nigga but a killa when the mood is right. Bullets have
the dogs howlin' at the moon at night."

119
00:12:51.700 --> 00:12:59.570
"Cool nigga but a killa when the mood is right. Bullets have
the dogs howlin' at the moon at night." Now when he says

120
00:12:59.570 --> 00:13:06.400
"cool nigga", what he's really saying is "I'm a...I'm
normally a calm, cool, and relaxed person, but I'm ready to

121
00:13:06.400 --> 00:13:11.620
take someone's life at any given moment." That's really what
he's saying. Like in general, "I'm a cool nigga. I'm a cool

122
00:13:11.620 --> 00:13:18.800
guy." It's probably what you should say. "I'm a cool dude.
I'm a cool guy, but still a killer. I'm still ready to

123
00:13:18.800 --> 00:13:25.480
kill..." you know "if the circumstances call for that at
any given moment", you know, "if it's the right moment for

124
00:13:25.480 --> 00:13:30.240
that to happen, then I'm ready to make that happen." That's
what he's saying, you know. And then he continues that by

125
00:13:30.240 --> 00:13:35.340
saying, "the bullets have the dogs howling at the moon at
night." And this is just, you know, more poetic, a more

126
00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:42.160
illustrative way of speaking because he's saying the bullets
from the gun, pop, pop, pop, that sound, it scares the dogs.

127
00:13:42.160 --> 00:13:47.720
And they start barking and howling at the moon and making
noise. Right? That's what happens. You know, dogs are gonna

128
00:13:47.720 --> 00:13:52.580
start barking and making noise. You get the idea, right?
Alright, cool. Let's go on to the next lines.

129
00:13:55.070 --> 00:14:00.430
"Mama, it's cold outside, ain't no hope outside. Couple
niggas gettin' money, most is broke outside."

130
00:14:02.230 --> 00:14:09.070
"Mama, it's cold outside, ain't no hope outside. Couple
niggas gettin' money, most is broke outside." So that first

131
00:14:09.070 --> 00:14:17.390
line, when he says "it's cold outside", what he's saying is
like the streets are cold and heartless. There's no empathy

132
00:14:17.390 --> 00:14:24.840
or, or love or help for anybody. It's just every man for
himself. And there's no hope outside. Everyone in...you

133
00:14:24.840 --> 00:14:29.520
know, when you leave the house and you see everyone outside,
everybody's hopeless. They...they don't see any way of

134
00:14:29.520 --> 00:14:35.630
this...they don't see this situation getting any better.
They don't see anybody coming to fix things. This is just

135
00:14:36.050 --> 00:14:41.770
the way it is where we live and it's just the way it's
always gonna be. These streets are cold. Nobody cares about

136
00:14:41.770 --> 00:14:49.110
anybody else. And you just got to fend for yourself and
survive. That's the mentality, you know? And then he says "a

137
00:14:49.110 --> 00:14:55.390
couple niggas getting money, but most is broke outside." So
a couple of people is on the block. They're on the street

138
00:14:55.480 --> 00:15:01.010
making money, however they can make money. But most people
in the neighborhood are broke as fuck. They have no money.

139
00:15:01.040 --> 00:15:07.500
Everybody's poor. You see what I'm saying? So everybody's
hopeless. And that's the idea. Alright, next lines.

140
00:15:09.600 --> 00:15:14.400
"Rocks in the house, sellin' dope outside. Reminiscin' on my
niggas that got smoked outside."

141
00:15:16.700 --> 00:15:24.130
"Rocks in the house, sellin' dope outside. Reminiscin' on my
niggas that got smoked outside" So "rocks" is slang for

142
00:15:24.230 --> 00:15:30.480
"crack rocks". You see what I'm saying? So when you take the
cocaine and you cook it up and it forms a solid, you know,

143
00:15:30.480 --> 00:15:36.760
rock-like object, then you chop it up into tiny, little
smaller rocks. And that's what we call "crack rocks". So

144
00:15:36.760 --> 00:15:43.350
when he says "rocks in the house", he's basically painting
the picture, you can imagine somebody in their kitchen

145
00:15:43.460 --> 00:15:49.060
cooking crack literally on the stove, and then they go
outside and they sell it. And that's what he means when he

146
00:15:49.060 --> 00:15:57.500
says "selling dope outside". So "dope" is slang for "drugs",
you see. So "we cook the crack in the house, we make the

147
00:15:57.500 --> 00:16:03.430
crack rocks, and we go outside and sell it." That's the
idea. And the next line, he says, "reminiscin' on my niggas

148
00:16:03.430 --> 00:16:10.180
that got smoked outside." So to "reminisce" just means "to
sit and think about some time or person from the past." So

149
00:16:10.180 --> 00:16:15.390
he's sitting and thinking about his friends that got
murdered outside. That's what he means when he says "got

150
00:16:15.390 --> 00:16:22.140
smoked" because to "get smoked" is like slang for to "get
killed or to get murdered". To smoke someone means to shoot

151
00:16:22.140 --> 00:16:27.300
them or kill them, you know? So he's saying, "I'm
reminiscing, I'm sitting, thinking about my friends, about

152
00:16:27.300 --> 00:16:32.730
my homies that got murdered outside in the street" due to
gang violence, most likely. You see what I'm saying?

153
00:16:34.170 --> 00:16:35.060
Alright, next lines.

154
00:16:37.010 --> 00:16:41.800
"Suckas in the house when them locs outside. Hustla gotta
eat when them folks outside."

155
00:16:43.910 --> 00:16:51.100
"Suckas in the house when them locs outside. Hustla gotta
eat when them folks outside." So the word "sucker", it's

156
00:16:51.100 --> 00:16:59.570
kind of hard to explain, but it's like...It's like an older
word that's slang for a loser or a punk or a coward, or just

157
00:16:59.570 --> 00:17:06.880
somebody who can't take care of themselves. They can't
defend themselves. They can't, you know, a sucker is like a

158
00:17:06.880 --> 00:17:12.460
loser, like a punk, a coward, a weak man, a weak person.
That's what you can think of when you hear "sucker". But

159
00:17:12.460 --> 00:17:19.630
it's like an old...it's an older word, you know, like from
the 90s, I think, or the early 2000s, you know. So "suckas

160
00:17:19.630 --> 00:17:28.160
in the house when them locs outside" and "loc", l-o-c-s. To
be honest, I can't really tell you exactly what "loc" means

161
00:17:28.500 --> 00:17:34.190
because I'm not involved in gang activities so if like a
real Crip gang member could probably give you the exact

162
00:17:34.190 --> 00:17:41.140
meaning. But when I hear "loc", what I think of is, it's
another way of referring to a Crip. So somebody from the

163
00:17:41.140 --> 00:17:48.370
Crip gang and they are a crip. Another word for Crip is
"loc" and they call each other that. They say, "What's up,

164
00:17:48.400 --> 00:17:52.730
loc? What's happenin', loc?" You know "what's crackin',
loc?" And again, don't quote me on this because I am not a

165
00:17:52.730 --> 00:17:58.480
Crip gang member, so I'm not like, certified to really be
teaching you about the way they speak or exactly what the

166
00:17:58.480 --> 00:18:04.030
words they use mean but I'm familiar enough to get the idea
and that's what I'm explaining to you. So when he says

167
00:18:04.030 --> 00:18:10.800
"locs", you can hear that and understand "Crips", the
members of the Crip Gang, okay? So when the Crips in the

168
00:18:10.800 --> 00:18:15.330
street, when these gang members are in the street doing
their activities, the suckers in the house, they know to

169
00:18:15.330 --> 00:18:20.220
stay in the house because it's dangerous when gang members
are in the street doing what they do. That's the idea that

170
00:18:20.220 --> 00:18:27.550
you can understand. So the next line, he says "hustla got to
eat when them folks outside." Now I don't...it's kinda hard

171
00:18:27.550 --> 00:18:34.330
because this one can be interpreted in a couple of ways. But
the idea that I understand when I hear this line is a

172
00:18:34.330 --> 00:18:40.880
hustler, which is somebody who hustles, somebody who works
really hard to make, you know, good money. You know, he's

173
00:18:40.880 --> 00:18:45.810
got to make his money as long as he's got paying customers.
You see what I'm saying? He has to take advantage of every

174
00:18:45.810 --> 00:18:51.910
opportunity to get paid. There's people in the street
willing to buy what he's selling. And he's got to eat. He's

175
00:18:51.910 --> 00:18:57.600
got to get paid. And that's, that's the...I guess now that I
hear myself saying it, you can think of it as slang or just

176
00:18:57.600 --> 00:19:04.400
this figurative way of speaking, you know? And I don't know
if this is a universal thing in the US, but like, at least

177
00:19:04.400 --> 00:19:14.120
in urban culture, definitely in like black urban culture, we
use the term or the word "eat" to refer to "getting paid

178
00:19:14.120 --> 00:19:18.620
good money". You know what I'm saying? Being
well-compensated for whatever work it is you're doing. So

179
00:19:18.970 --> 00:19:24.690
you might hear somebody say something like, "If you don't
work, you don't eat." And that's literally like "eat food",

180
00:19:24.690 --> 00:19:29.460
but it generally just means "survive". If you don't work,
you won't get paid, which means you can't survive. You know,

181
00:19:29.460 --> 00:19:34.990
if somebody says, "We're eating good over here." What that
means is literally you have enough money to buy good and

182
00:19:34.990 --> 00:19:40.790
healthy and quality food, but it just means you're doing
well in life. You're getting paid a lot of money. You're not

183
00:19:40.790 --> 00:19:46.070
just surviving, you're thriving. You're eating good. You
know, that's the idea. So "a hustler got to eat with them

184
00:19:46.070 --> 00:19:51.370
folks outside." "If there's people outside that's willing to
buy what I'm selling, I got to eat, bro, I got to get paid.

185
00:19:51.660 --> 00:19:55.600
I'm a hustler." That's the idea. Alright? Cool. Next lines.

186
00:19:57.980 --> 00:20:02.740
"Got a burner on my lap and I'm dippin' in my bucket. Life's
a bitch, nigga, fuck it."

187
00:20:04.840 --> 00:20:13.250
"Got a burner on my lap and I'm dippin' in my bucket. Life's
a bitch, nigga, fuck it." So that first line, "got a burner

188
00:20:13.280 --> 00:20:19.250
on my lap." Now you know what that is. It's just slang for
"gun". So he's riding around in his car with a gun sitting

189
00:20:19.250 --> 00:20:25.640
on his lap, which is like your lap is that area of your
legs, like the...where your thighs are. So imagine you're

190
00:20:25.640 --> 00:20:32.310
sitting down like, for example, Santa Claus. A lot of times
I don't know if you guys do this in your country, but at the

191
00:20:32.310 --> 00:20:38.410
mall around Christmastime, at least in the past, there would
be this person who dressed up like Santa Claus and he would

192
00:20:38.410 --> 00:20:43.620
sit in the big chair next to the Christmas tree, and the
kids could go sit on Santa's lap and take a picture with

193
00:20:43.620 --> 00:20:49.460
Santa. So that area of his body where they sit, which is
like his thigh, that part of his leg, that's your lap. And

194
00:20:50.190 --> 00:20:57.000
that's why we call laptop computers "laptops", because it
literally used to...use to put it on your lap and type. But

195
00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:04.330
anyway, anyway, he's saying he's riding around in his car
and he's got his gun on his lap. Ready for anything. Cause

196
00:21:04.330 --> 00:21:12.240
that's really what you gotta understand. So "I got my burner
on my lap, and I'm dipping in my bucket." So to "dip". It

197
00:21:12.240 --> 00:21:18.860
depends on the context, man. But in this case, it's like
slang. And what it means is ummm, ummm...It's just like

198
00:21:18.860 --> 00:21:24.340
slang for "driving around in my car". That's what you can
understand. If I'm dipping and he completes the sentence by

199
00:21:24.340 --> 00:21:32.130
saying, "dippin' in my bucket" and "bucket" is slang for
"car". But a "bucket" is like a...not a...it's not a fancy

200
00:21:32.130 --> 00:21:41.530
car. Typically, it's an older kind of beat up car. It's not
the nicest thing to look at. It's just just a regular car.

201
00:21:41.620 --> 00:21:47.990
Typically an older one that's not in the best condition. And
then the last line, he says, "Life's a bitch, nigga, fuck

202
00:21:47.990 --> 00:21:56.210
it." And "life's a bitch", it's just an expression that we
have that means "sometimes, life sucks". "It is what it is,"

203
00:21:56.210 --> 00:22:02.060
like, "whatever," you know, "life is shit". Tragic stuff
happens, you know, it's hard, but it is what it is. And

204
00:22:02.060 --> 00:22:07.280
that's what he means when he says, "Fuck it", somebody says,
"Ah, fuck it." It's just like, "Whatever, man. It is what it

205
00:22:07.280 --> 00:22:12.720
is. There's nothing I can do about it. I accept it. Fuck it.
I'm not going to try and change the situation or get

206
00:22:12.720 --> 00:22:18.820
stressed out about it. I don't care. Whatever. Fuck it."
Just know it's a very aggressive way of speaking. It's a

207
00:22:18.820 --> 00:22:24.300
vulgar thing to say. So you probably shouldn't say that at
work or in an interview or somebody that you don't know very

208
00:22:24.300 --> 00:22:30.750
well just because some people might take it as offensive.
You know? I don't, personally. But you get the idea, you

209
00:22:30.750 --> 00:22:35.970
know, like in certain situations, you're more formal, you're
more buttoned up, let's say, and in other situations you're

210
00:22:35.970 --> 00:22:42.260
less formal. And "fuck it" is definitely an expression
reserved for less formal situations, but I'm sure you know

211
00:22:42.260 --> 00:22:48.600
that. But that's the end of verse one, my friend. So after
that, it's just the chorus again, and then verse two and so

212
00:22:48.600 --> 00:22:53.650
on and so forth. So now I'm going to go back and play the
chorus and the first verse again, and hopefully with the

213
00:22:53.650 --> 00:22:59.700
context and the explanations, you can understand each line
much better. So let's play it now and find out.

214
00:23:02.420 --> 00:23:06.370
"I don't give a fuck.

215
00:23:06.370 --> 00:23:13.860
Ridin' with my burner and my beat turned up. AC blowin' and
my window down. Chuckin' up my hood when I hit yo town. I

216
00:23:14.500 --> 00:23:16.810
don't give a fuck.

217
00:23:16.810 --> 00:23:24.270
Ridin' with my burner and my beat turned up. AC blowin' and
my window down. Chuckin' up my hood when I hit yo town.

218
00:23:24.550 --> 00:23:30.660
Look, my mama wanna know why I'm bangin'. She told me I'ma
lose my life. I ain't trippin', I'm a Crip and I'ma do it

219
00:23:30.660 --> 00:23:37.310
right. 'Fore I run from a nigga, I'll lose the fight. I
gotta hustle, mama, I'ma move the white. If I died and came

220
00:23:37.380 --> 00:23:43.960
back, I'd do it twice. Brainwashed by the block, it consumed
my life. Cool nigga but a killa when the mood is right.

221
00:23:44.180 --> 00:23:50.000
Bullets have the dogs howlin' at the moon at night. Mama,
it's cold outside, ain't no hope outside. Couple niggas

222
00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:56.240
gettin' money, most is broke outside. Rocks in the house,
sellin' dope outside. Reminiscin' on my niggas that got

223
00:23:56.240 --> 00:24:03.400
smoked outside. Suckas in the house when them locs outside.
Hustla gotta eat when them folks outside. Got a burner on my

224
00:24:03.480 --> 00:24:09.870
lap and I'm dippin' in my bucket. Life's a bitch, nigga,
fuck it. I don't give a fuck. Ridin' with my burner and my

225
00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:18.390
beat turned up. AC blowin' and my window down. Chuckin' up
my hood when I hit yo town. I don't give a fuck. Ridin' with

226
00:24:18.390 --> 00:24:21.530
my burner and my beat turned up.

227
00:24:21.970 --> 00:24:26.180
AC blowin' and my window down. Chuckin' up my hood when I
hit yo town."

228
00:24:26.320 --> 00:24:33.900
And there you have it, my friends, I hope you enjoyed this
episode and this legendary piece of hip-hop culture. The

229
00:24:33.900 --> 00:24:40.220
effect that Nipsey has had on us simply cannot be
overstated, man, so I really encourage you to listen to more

230
00:24:40.220 --> 00:24:45.540
of his music and learn about his story. And I'll definitely
be featuring him and his work on the podcast again in the

231
00:24:45.540 --> 00:24:51.290
future. But for now, that is all, my friend. This is the
Life in English podcast. I am Tony Kaizen and I'll talk to

232
00:24:51.290 --> 00:24:52.650
you soon. Peace!

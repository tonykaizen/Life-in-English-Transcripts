00:00:01.510 --> 00:00:03.260
Life in English live stream.

2
00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:05.390
Talking about nothing, number 4.

3
00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:06.390
Here we go.

4
00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:14.540
Put it right about there, okay.

5
00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:17.670
Welcome to the live, y'all. We're just doing a live stream.

6
00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:19.380
I'm not talking about anything in particular.

7
00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:22.490
So feel free to ask all your questions, leave your comments.

8
00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:24.650
I'ma just be talking about some random stuff.

9
00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:30.240
This is really more like advanced listening practice in a chance for you to get your questions answered. Stuff like that.

10
00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:33.620
So we're just going to chill and hang out for probably an hour.

11
00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:38.160
I'm not going to do two and a half hours like I did last week, but I'll probably be here at least an hour.

12
00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.800
So leave your comments, man. I'm going to try to get to all of them.

13
00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:45.960
All right, give me a second. I'm trying to read the comments, y'all.

14
00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:52.170
Can you please explain the difference between than and then?

15
00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:57.840
The difference between than and then.

16
00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:04.830
So than is T H A N. Then is T H E N. Right?

17
00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:10.800
So 'than' is the word that we use to compare quantities, right?

18
00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:12.890
For example, "I have more than you"

19
00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:15.000
Or "you have more than me"

20
00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:18.180
Or "we have less than them"

21
00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.030
Or "they have less than us".

22
00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:23.670
That's T H A N. That's the way that we use that word.

23
00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:28.980
So whenever we're comparing the quantities of two things or the possession of two things, stuff like that,

24
00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:34.280
We're going to use the word 'than'. More than or less than or equal to. Right?

25
00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:42.160
Now, then T H E N. I think it depends on the context, actually.

26
00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:48.670
But 'then' is typically a word that we use to describe what's going to happen next.

27
00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:55.670
For example, "I'm going to the store and then I'm going home". Right?

28
00:01:55.670 --> 00:02:02.730
So I'm going to the store and after that or and then, which is basically the same thing, this next thing is going to happen.

29
00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:04.480
So that's typically the way we use the word then.

30
00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:09.270
But we also use the word then T H E N, in a way that's like...

31
00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:15.900
You know how when somebody tells you something, sometimes you respond in a way that's basically saying,

32
00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:20.190
"well, if this is the case, this other thing is also the case".

33
00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:23.210
That probably doesn't make sense the way I said it, so let me give you an example.

34
00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:28.660
Let's imagine you're talking to your friend, and he says,

35
00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:33.700
"if we don't go to the beach, then I don't want to go anywhere".

36
00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:37.270
That's one way of using the word then, like the way I just explained.

37
00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:38.920
But then you can respond by saying,

38
00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:41.070
"then let's go to the beach".

39
00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.710
So in that case, when I start the sentence with 'then' I'm saying,

40
00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:49.440
"well, if that's the case, this other thing is going to be the case". You know?

41
00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:53.780
I don't know, I can't remember the grammatical term for the word. I don't think it's conjunction.

42
00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:56.450
But let me know if that makes any sense.

43
00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:58.880
That's the difference to me between the two words and how we use them.

44
00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:04.130
If I had more time to think about it, I could probably explain it to you better, but there you go.

45
00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:08.770
Difference between could have and should have.

46
00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:11.200
That's a good question.

47
00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:18.640
So what's your name, bro? I am a stranger60. Whatever your name is, stranger.

48
00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:21.440
The difference between could have and should have.

49
00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:30.770
"Could have" is what we say, simply to express the fact that you had an opportunity in the past

50
00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:37.370
And you had an opportunity to take advantage of a situation or whatever it is.

51
00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:43.640
So you're just expressing the fact that there was a possibility that something happened or could have happened.

52
00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:46.130
I'm trying to explain it without using the words could have.

53
00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:57.580
Now, "should have" is what we say when we want to express the fact that we believe that the right thing to do was this thing.

54
00:03:57.830 --> 00:04:01.500
Like, for example... It's probably better if I explain with an example.

55
00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:06.000
Ah okay, so let's just say going to the movies, for example.

56
00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:09.880
We're talking about going out to the movies and we don't go.

57
00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:13.610
And the next day I say, "man, we could have gone to the movies".

58
00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:18.020
So all I'm expressing is that there was the possibility that we went to the movies.

59
00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:24.160
We were capable of doing it. We had the opportunity so we could have gone. Right?

60
00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:26.760
But if I say, "man, we should have gone to the movies".

61
00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:32.010
What I'm expressing is that I think the right thing to do would have been to go to the movies.

62
00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:37.220
That would have been the best choice, the best way to spend our night, the best decision to make.

63
00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:40.760
Because when you say "should", if you're saying something should be,

64
00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:44.660
You're expressing the idea that you think that's the right thing.

65
00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:46.380
You think that's the way it should be.

66
00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:49.170
Like when you tell somebody, "you should be a teacher".

67
00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:50.080
You're saying,

68
00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:55.260
"I recognize your talent, and I think the right thing for you to do is to be a teacher. That's what you should do".

69
00:04:55.630 --> 00:04:58.140
If I say you could be a teacher, it's like,

70
00:04:58.140 --> 00:05:01.590
"well, you have the ability and it's possible there's nothing stopping you".

71
00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:05.360
So it's the same thing as should have and could have. We're just referring to something in the past.

72
00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:07.220
Let me know if that makes sense.

73
00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:10.900
I don't know if I explained that clearly, but let me know.

74
00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:16.590
Hi, can you explain "have got" and when we need to use it? Please.

75
00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:21.730
Lom1008 I think is your name or your screen name.

76
00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:33.880
So have got... I mean, off the top of my head trying to explain like,

77
00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:38.870
What it is when I hear "have got" it just means "I have".

78
00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:40.200
It's just another way of saying I have.

79
00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:45.780
For example, "I have three kids" or "I have got three kids".

80
00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:49.380
Now, we typically don't say have got in informal speech.

81
00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:53.190
We'd say "I've got", which is a contracted version of I have got.

82
00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:58.110
So I'd say, "I have three kids" or "I've got three kids".

83
00:05:58.130 --> 00:06:02.770
And to me it's the same thing. But "I've got" is just more informal, you know?

84
00:06:05.030 --> 00:06:08.380
But it's really, really common, at least here in the States to hear people say I've got.

85
00:06:09.130 --> 00:06:11.000
Or for example, like "gotta".

86
00:06:12.050 --> 00:06:15.620
The contraction "gotta" a lot of people think, you know, got to, for example.

87
00:06:16.910 --> 00:06:17.950
I've gotta go to the store.

88
00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:22.020
But really the complete phrase is "I have got to go to the store".

89
00:06:22.020 --> 00:06:28.490
But we say "I've got to go to the store". You know, so we're just saying I have to go to the store.

90
00:06:28.490 --> 00:06:30.670
It's just another way of saying it. You know?

91
00:06:32.570 --> 00:06:35.060
So I don't know if that makes sense, but to simplify it,

92
00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:40.030
It's the same thing as saying "I have", it's just less formal. You know?

93
00:06:42.610 --> 00:06:45.930
At least the way I think about it off the top of my head. That's the answer.

94
00:06:47.070 --> 00:06:48.060
How's your Spanish?

95
00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:57.890
On a scale of one to ten? Honestly, five.

96
00:07:00.420 --> 00:07:03.010
Yeah, five. Six on a good day, but five.

97
00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:08.630
People tell me that it's higher than that, but I think they're just being nice.

98
00:07:09.220 --> 00:07:12.500
I'm pretty self-aware and I hear myself speaking Spanish,

99
00:07:12.500 --> 00:07:16.800
Trying to express myself and I would say, from zero to ten it's probably a five.

100
00:07:18.090 --> 00:07:20.900
Which technically is an F for fucking sucks.

101
00:07:22.080 --> 00:07:23.700
Let me go back to these comments, I know there's a lot.

102
00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:25.990
What is facts?

103
00:07:28.680 --> 00:07:31.380
What is facts? Oh, okay, that's a good question.

104
00:07:31.380 --> 00:07:35.540
So facts is kind of like, um, I guess you could call it slang.

105
00:07:35.770 --> 00:07:40.710
It's just a word that we say when somebody is speaking the truth because...

106
00:07:40.760 --> 00:07:47.090
And you spelled it F A X, which is like an electronic device, something completely different.

107
00:07:47.090 --> 00:07:51.280
But facts F A C T S, facts.

108
00:07:51.660 --> 00:07:56.740
When somebody says that it means they're saying like, what you're saying is true and I agree.

109
00:07:56.740 --> 00:07:59.450
Like, that's real shit, like real talk, facts.

110
00:07:59.790 --> 00:08:00.600
Because you're not lying.

111
00:08:01.300 --> 00:08:05.240
If you're speaking facts, if what you're saying is a fact, then it's not a lie. It's not false.

112
00:08:05.610 --> 00:08:06.590
So that's why people say that.

113
00:08:07.260 --> 00:08:13.880
Like I might say, "Messi is the greatest player of all time" and you might say, "facts".

114
00:08:14.340 --> 00:08:18.220
And you're saying that's a fact, that's true. Right? That's not false.

115
00:08:18.870 --> 00:08:20.910
So that's what facts means.

116
00:08:22.850 --> 00:08:25.130
How do you be good at English?

117
00:08:29.630 --> 00:08:30.340
Practice English.

118
00:08:33.120 --> 00:08:37.730
Can you stop worrying about...? Oh, damn, I can't read today.

119
00:08:38.200 --> 00:08:43.890
How can I stop worrying about my English when I start talking to native speakers on social media?

120
00:08:47.360 --> 00:08:58.500
How? I don't know if this answer is going to be helpful to you,

121
00:08:58.500 --> 00:09:01.730
But this is just what I would do if I were you. This is what I've done.

122
00:09:02.400 --> 00:09:13.230
I think the subject of like learning how to be more calm or confident or secure, sure of yourself, whatever it is,

123
00:09:13.540 --> 00:09:16.790
Especially when in public or especially when interacting with other people.

124
00:09:18.170 --> 00:09:21.850
Like, you know, a lot of people have a bunch of different techniques and recommendations,

125
00:09:21.850 --> 00:09:25.990
But what worked for me, man, is just making the simple choice to not care.

126
00:09:25.990 --> 00:09:29.320
Like, it's a choice that you can make. You know?

127
00:09:29.620 --> 00:09:34.560
You obviously can't control the thoughts that enter your mind involuntarily. Right?

128
00:09:35.340 --> 00:09:37.190
But you can choose to entertain them or not.

129
00:09:38.400 --> 00:09:44.500
And when I say entertain I mean like, give them your time, attention, and consideration. Right? Acknowledge them.

130
00:09:44.820 --> 00:09:45.400
You don't have to.

131
00:09:46.290 --> 00:09:49.510
So in a moment where you're like, feeling insecure or afraid or you're hearing these negative thoughts,

132
00:09:49.510 --> 00:09:51.030
You don't have to pay attention to that stuff.

133
00:09:51.080 --> 00:09:54.890
I know that sounds like maybe an oversimplification.

134
00:09:54.890 --> 00:09:56.300
Like maybe it doesn't even make sense.

135
00:09:56.640 --> 00:10:01.150
What I'm trying to say is like, you can choose to just not care. You can choose that.

136
00:10:02.630 --> 00:10:06.610
So how do you stop caring? Just fucking decide, like, I don't care.

137
00:10:08.940 --> 00:10:12.110
I wish I had like, a more detailed, like beautiful answer or something like that.

138
00:10:12.110 --> 00:10:18.040
But it really is just a conscious choice that you make to care or not care about something. S

139
00:10:18.040 --> 00:10:21.440
o if you just, if you know that you can speak English, you can communicate,

140
00:10:21.750 --> 00:10:23.260
You can understand when people talk to you.

141
00:10:24.850 --> 00:10:28.510
Like, just say what you got to say. You know?

142
00:10:28.830 --> 00:10:33.740
I think you just have to stop worrying about what the consequences are going to be. That probably doesn't sound good.

143
00:10:33.740 --> 00:10:38.390
But what I mean is a lot of times people are nervous because they're anticipating a negative outcome.

144
00:10:39.580 --> 00:10:41.480
They're anticipating like, disaster.

145
00:10:41.480 --> 00:10:45.390
They're imagining the worst-case scenario a lot of times, and that makes them scared.

146
00:10:46.050 --> 00:10:49.350
So if you just choose to focus on the present moment and just communicate,

147
00:10:49.350 --> 00:10:53.290
Or if you choose to think positive thoughts or choose to just not care at all what happens,

148
00:10:54.150 --> 00:10:55.780
Especially when you know you have good intentions.

149
00:10:57.490 --> 00:11:00.960
I mean, what more can you do? That's just works for me.

150
00:11:00.960 --> 00:11:08.020
I don't know what to tell you, is hard to tell you how you should do something because I'm not you, you know,

151
00:11:08.410 --> 00:11:11.930
But that's what I did. It works for me.

152
00:11:16.780 --> 00:11:19.890
Somebody wants me to do a quick pronunciation exercise.

153
00:11:19.960 --> 00:11:23.930
So the words CAP, CUP and COP.

154
00:11:24.420 --> 00:11:27.990
Before I say them, I want you to think to yourself, how do you pronounce these words?

155
00:11:28.370 --> 00:11:30.760
C A P. How would you pronounce that?

156
00:11:32.030 --> 00:11:34.370
Obviously, I can't hear you, but I want you to say it out loud.

157
00:11:34.740 --> 00:11:36.910
I don't care if you're on the bus, I don't care if you're in the kitchen,

158
00:11:37.030 --> 00:11:39.220
I don't care what you're doing right now. Say it out loud.

159
00:11:39.220 --> 00:11:40.740
CAP. How do you pronounce that?

160
00:11:43.810 --> 00:11:46.030
I would pronounce it, cap.

161
00:11:47.510 --> 00:11:49.590
Cap is cap. Like, "no cap, bro"

162
00:11:49.590 --> 00:11:51.310
"stop capping, nigga.. fuck you mean".

163
00:11:51.920 --> 00:11:53.750
That's cap. Right?

164
00:11:55.040 --> 00:12:01.280
Cap, and cap. All right? So C A P is cap.

165
00:12:01.940 --> 00:12:02.920
Hopefully, you got that one right.

166
00:12:03.920 --> 00:12:05.040
Now, the next one is what?

167
00:12:05.040 --> 00:12:10.530
C U P, CUP. How would you pronounce that word? Again, say it out loud.

168
00:12:13.410 --> 00:12:16.150
One more time. C U P. How do you pronounce it?

169
00:12:18.660 --> 00:12:20.020
I would say, cup.

170
00:12:21.540 --> 00:12:24.560
So instead of "ah" like cap, we say "oh",

171
00:12:24.900 --> 00:12:33.090
Like cup or fuck or stuck or truck or bus or but or what. Cup. Right?

172
00:12:34.480 --> 00:12:37.320
So CAP, Cap. CUP, cup.

173
00:12:37.850 --> 00:12:44.800
The last one, C O P. How would you pronounce that word? COP.

174
00:12:46.870 --> 00:12:52.700
I would say, cop. Cop, you know?

175
00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:58.860
So CAP, cap. CUP, cup. COP, cop.

176
00:12:59.510 --> 00:13:04.800
I block and stop and watch and pop and rock, shock, cop. Okay?

177
00:13:04.880 --> 00:13:12.240
So ah, uh, oh. Those are the three sounds. Hopefully that helps.

178
00:13:14.740 --> 00:13:16.070
Why do you know Spanish?

179
00:13:17.910 --> 00:13:23.690
Because some of my good friends in college were Mexican, and they were always speaking Spanish,

180
00:13:24.130 --> 00:13:28.230
And I got tired of being the only fucking guy in the room that couldn't understand.

181
00:13:29.170 --> 00:13:35.190
So I asked him to teach me Spanish one day and the rest was kind of, you know, history, as they say.

182
00:13:35.190 --> 00:13:39.210
Do you think that it's hard to learn Spanish?

183
00:13:39.890 --> 00:13:42.480
Honestly, I don't. I really don't.

184
00:13:42.480 --> 00:13:46.820
I think Spanish is a very simple language, and if you speak English,

185
00:13:46.820 --> 00:13:49.100
It's definitely the first foreign language that you should learn.

186
00:13:53.160 --> 00:13:56.640
Yeah, I think it's one of the... I'm not going to say it's one of the easiest languages to learn

187
00:13:56.640 --> 00:14:00.100
Because I have no idea about the difficulty of, you know, all the languages.

188
00:14:00.180 --> 00:14:06.990
But, and maybe I'm just, you know, naturally like predisposed to learn languages.

189
00:14:06.990 --> 00:14:09.650
Maybe it would be extremely hard for other English speakers, I don't know.

190
00:14:10.140 --> 00:14:16.420
But in my experience, Spanish was not easy to learn.

191
00:14:16.530 --> 00:14:20.970
But it's a simple language, you know, so if you just practice and study, then it's not difficult

192
00:14:21.290 --> 00:14:26.520
because it follows very clear and consistent patterns in terms of pronunciation,

193
00:14:26.970 --> 00:14:31.120
Verb conjugation, grammar, and things like that.

194
00:14:31.500 --> 00:14:33.140
The grammar was a challenge at first, for sure.

195
00:14:33.140 --> 00:14:37.300
You just have to get used to it. And my grammar still is not that good today,

196
00:14:37.300 --> 00:14:41.540
But I can make myself understood and people tell me that my grammar is okay, so.

197
00:14:44.120 --> 00:14:49.180
So we're talking about like, standard textbook, correct Spanish, then maybe it's difficult.

198
00:14:49.620 --> 00:14:55.220
I don't know because I don't know that type of Spanish, but the spoken language in general to me is not difficult.

199
00:14:55.390 --> 00:14:59.620
The difficulty of Spanish is understanding Spanish speakers because you talk so fucking fast.

200
00:15:00.260 --> 00:15:00.760
You know what I mean?

201
00:15:01.240 --> 00:15:04.090
Especially from certain countries. Just talk so fast.

202
00:15:04.380 --> 00:15:10.830
And not only that but like, different countries have different words for the same objects or feelings or situations.

203
00:15:11.010 --> 00:15:11.460
You know what I mean?

204
00:15:12.870 --> 00:15:18.800
Like, I think it was maybe it feels like a month ago, I learned the word vaina,

205
00:15:19.450 --> 00:15:22.360
Which I guess is heavily used in the Dominican Republic.

206
00:15:22.540 --> 00:15:26.890
Which can be anything. The word vaina can be anything. Stuff like that.

207
00:15:27.160 --> 00:15:29.020
I've been speaking Spanish five years.

208
00:15:29.020 --> 00:15:33.160
I had never heard that word before because I never really talked to anybody from the Dominican, you know?

209
00:15:34.470 --> 00:15:38.070
But anyway, I said all that to say, I don't think it's too difficult.

210
00:15:38.400 --> 00:15:43.290
I just think the challenge is understanding all Spanish speakers from all over the world.

211
00:15:44.010 --> 00:15:50.850
Because Spanish is Spanish, but at the same time it definitely changes from region to region. Right?

212
00:15:50.850 --> 00:15:52.760
Just like any other language, I imagine, so...

213
00:15:56.130 --> 00:15:58.430
Turn this live in Spanish.

214
00:15:58.470 --> 00:16:00.590
Nope! Can't do it. Life in English.

215
00:16:02.690 --> 00:16:04.450
Have you done the IELTS test?

216
00:16:04.450 --> 00:16:08.750
No, I have not. Isn't the IELTS for people trying to prove that they can speak English?

217
00:16:11.620 --> 00:16:15.390
I think, I don't think English teachers take the IELTS. To be honest, I don't know.

218
00:16:16.110 --> 00:16:18.090
But I don't think they do. But no, I've never taken that test.

219
00:16:18.360 --> 00:16:23.810
I've never taken any exam to test my English level other than in public school, obviously.

220
00:16:24.320 --> 00:16:27.280
And there was one class that like, I fucking hated school in general,

221
00:16:27.280 --> 00:16:29.570
But that was one class that I just naturally did good in.

222
00:16:30.210 --> 00:16:33.730
Like I remember in multiple years during my schooling, my teachers,

223
00:16:34.050 --> 00:16:38.640
My literature teachers telling me like, that I was doing really good in the class.

224
00:16:38.640 --> 00:16:43.840
Like, I was a good writer and I could like, formulate and express my ideas really well. You know?

225
00:16:45.490 --> 00:16:48.920
That was something that came natural, but everything else certainly did not.

226
00:16:48.920 --> 00:16:51.550
Like, I'm terrible at math, you know.

227
00:16:51.890 --> 00:16:54.940
I don't even, I'm not even sure I could do like, eighth-grade level math right now.

228
00:16:57.100 --> 00:17:01.390
And I find myself constantly trying to do simple multiplication equations, division,

229
00:17:01.390 --> 00:17:07.600
And stuff like that just with money and other things and time and stuff. And can't do it. You know?

230
00:17:09.520 --> 00:17:12.570
You didn't ask me about that. So let me get back to these questions.

231
00:17:13.850 --> 00:17:15.590
What's the best way to learn English?

232
00:17:19.550 --> 00:17:23.080
The answer to that question is subjective because everybody's different, right?

233
00:17:23.630 --> 00:17:27.230
Some people prefer to learn things by doing things, like me.

234
00:17:28.770 --> 00:17:32.400
I like to learn by experience, I like to put my hands on it, take it apart,

235
00:17:32.400 --> 00:17:38.450
Put it together, and play with it to see how it works. Figuratively and literally. Right?

236
00:17:39.050 --> 00:17:43.890
But some people like, need to watch a video of it being done, and then immediately they can just go do it.

237
00:17:43.950 --> 00:17:48.480
Other people if you just talk to them and they just hear and they can learn that way.

238
00:17:48.550 --> 00:17:53.710
Other people need to read their instructions or their lesson or whatever it is. So everybody's different.

239
00:17:54.330 --> 00:17:57.760
Some people will prefer to listen to podcasts, other people will prefer TV series,

240
00:17:58.030 --> 00:18:03.830
Some people prefer music or the news or talking to real people. You know?

241
00:18:04.250 --> 00:18:08.170
So what's the best way? I don't know if there is one best way.

242
00:18:08.170 --> 00:18:12.830
I would say the most effective thing you can be doing, though, is talking to real people. You know?

243
00:18:13.440 --> 00:18:19.160
Everybody does all that other stuff. Podcasts, movies, books, series, music, etc.

244
00:18:20.250 --> 00:18:26.480
But the most effective way to improve your listening and speaking skills is listening and talking to a human being.

245
00:18:27.140 --> 00:18:29.820
So if I had to choose, I would say that's the best way.

246
00:18:32.080 --> 00:18:36.690
Will ever I be fluent in English like you? What is my hope there?

247
00:18:44.530 --> 00:18:46.090
Will you ever be fluent in English like me?

248
00:18:46.130 --> 00:18:51.340
I don't know what you mean by that. So I can't really answer that part of your question.

249
00:18:52.520 --> 00:18:57.450
But I mean, I understand that you're asking, will you ever get to a high level of English. Like native level?

250
00:18:57.450 --> 00:18:58.750
I mean, it's my first language, bro.

251
00:18:58.750 --> 00:19:04.750
So I don't know if you're saying, will you ever speak it as if you were born speaking it? I don't know.

252
00:19:04.750 --> 00:19:09.050
I mean, it's definitely possible. People do it all the time. I've never done it.

253
00:19:10.650 --> 00:19:13.720
So, and to be honest, I don't know if that should be your focus.

254
00:19:13.720 --> 00:19:18.370
I don't think your goal when learning to speak a foreign language.

255
00:19:18.370 --> 00:19:23.290
Should be speaking it as if you have been speaking it since you were born.

256
00:19:25.380 --> 00:19:28.840
I don't think the goal should be to speak it exactly like you speak your first language.

257
00:19:28.840 --> 00:19:33.520
I mean, that's such a difficult thing to achieve. You know what I mean?

258
00:19:34.690 --> 00:19:40.070
So it's like if you're always... I mean, I guess if you want to shoot for the stars or whatever, then yeah, that's cool.

259
00:19:40.070 --> 00:19:43.890
But a lot of times you might just be setting yourself up or,

260
00:19:43.890 --> 00:19:47.230
In other words, preparing yourself for disappointment. You know?

261
00:19:47.230 --> 00:19:51.890
Because you're never or it's going to take so long to reach that goal, generally speaking,

262
00:19:51.890 --> 00:19:54.600
For most people, that you might start to feel demotivated.

263
00:19:54.600 --> 00:19:56.070
Like, "man, it's never going to be perfect".

264
00:19:56.070 --> 00:19:57.240
And then you start to lose hope.

265
00:19:58.340 --> 00:20:02.470
So I think a much more realistic, attainable goal is to be conversational.

266
00:20:03.850 --> 00:20:08.570
To be able to sit down with almost anybody and have a conversation.

267
00:20:09.700 --> 00:20:16.360
Or go to almost any English-speaking country and be able to survive and communicate. That should be the goal.

268
00:20:16.730 --> 00:20:21.240
Because once you get to that place, you can talk to anybody and then everything that comes after that,

269
00:20:21.240 --> 00:20:23.500
It's just like a bonus. It's extra.

270
00:20:23.500 --> 00:20:28.180
You never stop learning new words, expressions or getting exposed to different accents.

271
00:20:28.180 --> 00:20:33.440
Not just the language itself but the culture that's influencing that language, you learn about that stuff too. You know?

272
00:20:34.060 --> 00:20:36.920
So I think you should focus much more on that, man.

273
00:20:36.920 --> 00:20:40.940
Not being perfect or speaking just like me, but being conversational.

274
00:20:41.320 --> 00:20:44.490
Because if you're conversational, that means that you have mastered the fundamentals,

275
00:20:44.490 --> 00:20:48.490
Which is always the most important part of anything that you're doing.

276
00:20:49.320 --> 00:20:54.260
So master the fundamentals and then just kind of build on top of that, understanding that it's going to take time.

277
00:20:55.330 --> 00:20:58.350
But the more effort you put in, the better the results you get out.

278
00:20:58.350 --> 00:20:59.370
So it's really up to you.

279
00:20:59.710 --> 00:21:02.420
So is there any hope? I don't know. You tell me.

280
00:21:04.060 --> 00:21:05.180
You know, another question I have, bro.

281
00:21:05.180 --> 00:21:08.130
And I was thinking, like before I started recording is

282
00:21:08.410 --> 00:21:14.170
When I was thinking about Christmas is around the corner as well as my birthday is next month and stuff like that,

283
00:21:14.170 --> 00:21:15.810
And I was thinking about why do people celebrate?

284
00:21:15.810 --> 00:21:17.910
Why do people exchange gifts on Christmas and stuff?

285
00:21:19.520 --> 00:21:22.650
And after hearing myself speak, just in case you don't understand,

286
00:21:22.650 --> 00:21:27.960
When I say Christmas is around the corner, that's an expression that means like, it's very close.

287
00:21:28.400 --> 00:21:29.610
It's going to happen very soon.

288
00:21:30.100 --> 00:21:33.120
So I was thinking about all that and birthdays and stuff,

289
00:21:33.120 --> 00:21:36.350
And it made me ask myself like, why do people fear getting older?

290
00:21:38.260 --> 00:21:39.500
Have you ever asked yourself that question?

291
00:21:39.500 --> 00:21:43.600
Like, why do people... Why are they so afraid of getting older?

292
00:21:43.600 --> 00:21:49.280
And you see it all around the world and I think with men and women. You know?

293
00:21:49.820 --> 00:21:54.830
People who are like afraid of getting wrinkles in their face or their body not functioning like it once did.

294
00:21:58.110 --> 00:22:00.960
All that type of stuff, getting sick, dying, and things like that.

295
00:22:01.220 --> 00:22:06.430
Not looking as physically attractive as you did when you were 21 or 30 or whatever.

296
00:22:06.870 --> 00:22:10.980
Why do you think people are so afraid of getting old?

297
00:22:12.820 --> 00:22:16.780
And do you think it's just the physical aspect of getting old that people are uncomfortable with?

298
00:22:17.200 --> 00:22:23.420
Because when you think about the emotional or the, let's say, intellectual for lack of a better word,

299
00:22:23.420 --> 00:22:28.050
The spiritual aspects of getting older like, it's a net positive, in my opinion.

300
00:22:29.650 --> 00:22:34.280
Hopefully, as you get older you get wiser.

301
00:22:34.370 --> 00:22:38.460
Like, you have more life experiences and you're learning from those experiences

302
00:22:38.460 --> 00:22:43.200
And you're applying that newfound knowledge to, you know, your future or the next experiences, however you say it.

303
00:22:44.420 --> 00:22:45.640
And you're learning and you're getting better.

304
00:22:45.640 --> 00:22:49.270
You're constantly becoming a better, smarter, more evolved,

305
00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:52.560
And optimized version of yourself as you get older.

306
00:22:53.030 --> 00:23:00.530
Because when you're young, bro, you're fucking 14, 18, 21. I mean, even 25 or 30, in some cases.

307
00:23:00.530 --> 00:23:02.710
It's like, you don't know shit bro, you're dumb as hell.

308
00:23:03.790 --> 00:23:08.360
Don't really have the experience that you need to be the person that you should be.

309
00:23:09.340 --> 00:23:11.100
So and maybe that doesn't make sense.

310
00:23:11.100 --> 00:23:13.760
But what I'm saying is like typically, generally speaking,

311
00:23:13.760 --> 00:23:17.550
The younger the people are like, the less experienced they are.

312
00:23:17.550 --> 00:23:25.260
Which means the less wise they are, which means the less than optimal choices they make. You know what I'm saying?

313
00:23:25.750 --> 00:23:27.750
So I think getting older like you get wiser,

314
00:23:27.750 --> 00:23:32.990
You get smarter and you learn how to live better in a way that's better for you.

315
00:23:33.230 --> 00:23:37.150
You learn how to be yourself, or more of yourself. You know what I mean?

316
00:23:37.700 --> 00:23:38.890
Getting older is the shit.

317
00:23:40.040 --> 00:23:43.690
Obviously, it comes with responsibility, but you know, that's just life.

318
00:23:44.090 --> 00:23:47.440
So being like young and dumb is fun, I guess.

319
00:23:47.470 --> 00:23:51.990
But I think being old and smart is pretty fucking cool, too. W

320
00:23:52.210 --> 00:23:52.900
hat do you guys think?

321
00:23:54.500 --> 00:24:00.160
It's fun. Like, when we are kids we want to be grown. And when we get old, people want to go back.

322
00:24:00.160 --> 00:24:01.180
Yeah, absolutely, man.

323
00:24:02.260 --> 00:24:04.720
It's like the classic experience for a lot of people when we're young,

324
00:24:04.720 --> 00:24:11.570
We want to be grown and have independence and just do what we want and, you know, all that type of stuff.

325
00:24:11.570 --> 00:24:15.870
Because we don't really know, most of the time nobody explains to us that

326
00:24:16.400 --> 00:24:22.420
What we imagine as life as an adult is just a small piece of the entire pie. You know?

327
00:24:22.480 --> 00:24:28.950
It comes with a lot more responsibility and freedom, which also comes with responsibility.

328
00:24:28.950 --> 00:24:30.950
Like, we imagine the freedom that adults have,

329
00:24:30.950 --> 00:24:35.840
But we don't understand that you cannot separate freedom from responsibility. You know?

330
00:24:36.570 --> 00:24:41.070
So I think that's why as kids, we want so badly to be adults.

331
00:24:41.070 --> 00:24:46.380
And then as adults like, I don't necessarily I want to be a kid anymore.

332
00:24:46.510 --> 00:24:48.240
It's not like I want to go back to my childhood.

333
00:24:52.540 --> 00:24:55.190
Yeah, to be honest, I don't think I would if I had the chance,

334
00:24:55.530 --> 00:24:58.830
If I could just go back to being the kid, I don't even think I would.

335
00:24:59.440 --> 00:25:05.330
I would prefer to like, learn how to take the best aspects of what it meant to be a kid

336
00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:09.940
And integrate them into my adult life. I would prefer to do that. You know?

337
00:25:11.610 --> 00:25:13.290
But you're right, a lot of people do feel that way.

338
00:25:16.360 --> 00:25:18.600
I don't know. I just don't understand why people fear getting older.

339
00:25:19.950 --> 00:25:23.760
I don't know if it's the fear of losing your physical attractiveness,

340
00:25:23.790 --> 00:25:25.460
I don't know if it's the fear of death itself.

341
00:25:27.040 --> 00:25:32.930
If it's the fear of sickness or what exactly. I don't know.

342
00:25:33.950 --> 00:25:39.280
Which makes me think of a really, really interesting idea that a friend of mine told me

343
00:25:39.350 --> 00:25:44.560
A couple of years ago when we were talking about life after death and reincarnation and things like that.

344
00:25:45.160 --> 00:25:48.860
And what she believes is that reincarnation is real,

345
00:25:49.220 --> 00:25:53.470
But it's not based on how good or how bad of a person you are during your life.

346
00:25:53.510 --> 00:25:56.670
That's not what determines what you will be in the next life.

347
00:25:56.670 --> 00:26:00.260
For example, if you're just a saint, an amazing person in the next life,

348
00:26:00.920 --> 00:26:05.020
You'll have higher social status, more fortune, more money, or whatever it is.

349
00:26:05.520 --> 00:26:08.040
Your life isn't going to be better for that reason.

350
00:26:08.040 --> 00:26:09.690
Or if you're just a piece of shit and you're an asshole,

351
00:26:09.690 --> 00:26:14.340
You're not going to be born as somebody like anus or something like that.

352
00:26:14.340 --> 00:26:18.460
Or you're not going to be poor and broke and miserable in your next life.

353
00:26:18.870 --> 00:26:20.050
She doesn't believe that's how it works.

354
00:26:21.010 --> 00:26:26.930
She believes that reincarnation is based on how many and how well,

355
00:26:28.300 --> 00:26:31.110
How many lessons and how well you learned them during your life.

356
00:26:31.220 --> 00:26:37.020
So how many life lessons you can manage to learn doing your life.

357
00:26:37.040 --> 00:26:41.460
Because during your entire lifetime life is throwing these situations at you

358
00:26:42.370 --> 00:26:44.820
And you have a chance to learn something from every experience, right?

359
00:26:45.290 --> 00:26:49.450
So she believes based on how you learn your life lessons or if you learn them,

360
00:26:50.080 --> 00:26:52.130
That will determine the quality of your next life.

361
00:26:52.410 --> 00:26:54.950
So if you go through life learning the lessons that you're supposed to learn,

362
00:26:54.950 --> 00:26:57.250
You're paying attention, you're trying to evolve and grow.

363
00:26:57.530 --> 00:26:58.970
Your next life will not be better.

364
00:26:58.970 --> 00:27:02.600
It will be easier to accomplish the things that you want to accomplish

365
00:27:03.310 --> 00:27:06.320
Because you learned the lessons that you needed to learn in your past life,

366
00:27:06.380 --> 00:27:08.240
Which sets you up for the next one.

367
00:27:08.640 --> 00:27:14.710
Now, if you go through life just refusing to learn, the lessons that life or God or the universe or whatever,

368
00:27:15.260 --> 00:27:18.750
However you see it, whatever you want to call it. Let's just call it life.

369
00:27:20.240 --> 00:27:23.490
If you refuse to learn those lessons like, your next life is going to be even harder.

370
00:27:24.260 --> 00:27:27.970
Because you refused to learn the things that you needed to learn before you went on to your next life.

371
00:27:28.360 --> 00:27:31.440
And then it just creates this positive or negative feedback loop.

372
00:27:31.600 --> 00:27:33.830
And that's how she thinks reincarnation works.

373
00:27:34.100 --> 00:27:37.910
And ever since she shared that idea with me, like, I've never stopped thinking about it.

374
00:27:39.250 --> 00:27:42.880
And I think I became, like, more attentive to that idea

375
00:27:42.880 --> 00:27:49.370
And like trying to put more attention on whether or not I'm learning the lessons.

376
00:27:49.370 --> 00:27:52.130
I'm supposed to be learning from the experiences that I'm having. You know?

377
00:27:54.040 --> 00:27:55.820
It's an interesting idea. What do you guys think?

378
00:27:55.820 --> 00:27:59.330
Do you guys believe in reincarnation? Life after death?

379
00:28:01.260 --> 00:28:01.820
What do you guys think?

380
00:28:04.040 --> 00:28:06.950
Bro, you're 26 years old, you're already worried about being an adult?

381
00:28:14.920 --> 00:28:18.220
I don't understand the question, actually. It's a good question.

382
00:28:19.920 --> 00:28:23.060
Or it's a curious question, but I don't really understand what you mean.

383
00:28:23.620 --> 00:28:27.730
Like, 26 is too young to be thinking about my adult life?

384
00:28:27.810 --> 00:28:32.240
I completely disagree. I completely disagree.

385
00:28:33.270 --> 00:28:36.610
And maybe I'm, I guess I understand what you're trying to say, which is like,

386
00:28:36.610 --> 00:28:40.370
"Man, enjoy your life, you're young. You don't have to worry about this, that and the third".

387
00:28:40.370 --> 00:28:43.540
And I never said that I was worried about being an adult, first of all.

388
00:28:44.360 --> 00:28:46.310
So I don't know when you heard that because I never said that.

389
00:28:46.580 --> 00:28:48.720
But second of all, I guess what you're trying to say is like,

390
00:28:49.600 --> 00:28:51.740
"Enjoy your life while you're young. 26 is young".

391
00:28:52.130 --> 00:28:56.470
I totally agree, but that doesn't mean that you can't be thinking about your adult life.

392
00:28:58.050 --> 00:29:00.380
Like, where you want your life to go, if you don't think about it,

393
00:29:00.380 --> 00:29:01.970
Then what the fuck are you going to do?

394
00:29:01.970 --> 00:29:04.120
You're just going to let life happen to you?

395
00:29:07.660 --> 00:29:09.720
I don't know. I just, I see things differently.

396
00:29:09.850 --> 00:29:12.660
Obviously, we might have a difference of opinion, but I just see it differently.

397
00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:15.900
I think we don't get taught to think about our adult lives early enough.

398
00:29:16.290 --> 00:29:19.700
Or we get taught to think about the wrong aspects of our adult life

399
00:29:20.030 --> 00:29:23.830
Or we get taught to think about it in the wrong way, as if it's just responsibility,

400
00:29:23.830 --> 00:29:29.450
Responsibility, bills go to school, get a job, have a family, raise that family, get sick and die.

401
00:29:30.460 --> 00:29:33.480
And that's why I think people are so afraid of it. You know?

402
00:29:34.930 --> 00:29:38.650
Either because it's all unknown and they don't know what to do or all they see is misery

403
00:29:39.160 --> 00:29:43.480
And bills and taxes and a job that they hate because they can't make a living doing what they want,

404
00:29:43.480 --> 00:29:46.590
Because everybody told them it was impossible, that type of shit.

405
00:29:46.640 --> 00:29:50.410
You know what I'm saying? But you don't have to think about it that way.

406
00:29:50.830 --> 00:29:54.720
I think if, it depends on how you teach the kid as well.

407
00:29:54.790 --> 00:30:00.050
Like, as a child, you can teach them about tax laws and philosophy and human psychology,

408
00:30:00.050 --> 00:30:06.640
You just have to break it down into little pieces that they can consume and still get the idea. You know?

409
00:30:06.770 --> 00:30:09.050
So you can teach kids to think about their life as an adult,

410
00:30:09.260 --> 00:30:13.570
What they want to do with their lives without making it too serious or too heavy, or too dramatic.

411
00:30:14.790 --> 00:30:17.870
And give them the tools and the mindset and way of thinking that they need

412
00:30:18.190 --> 00:30:21.470
So that when they finally decide or find out what they want to do with their adult life,

413
00:30:21.920 --> 00:30:25.910
They have the mental capacity and resources to get it done as opposed to

414
00:30:25.910 --> 00:30:28.910
Just being young and dumb and having fun until you're 35 and then saying,

415
00:30:28.910 --> 00:30:30.880
"okay, let me get serious about life".

416
00:30:33.800 --> 00:30:36.380
I'm sure that works for somebody, but it doesn't work for me, you know.

417
00:30:36.490 --> 00:30:39.590
So I guess it's just two different ways of seeing it.

418
00:30:39.590 --> 00:30:42.890
And again, I didn't understand your question and I responded anyway.

419
00:30:42.890 --> 00:30:47.410
So forgive me if I took it out of context or misunderstood it, but that's what I think.

420
00:30:49.860 --> 00:30:52.430
Could you explain different ways to say "I like you"?

421
00:30:57.640 --> 00:30:58.350
That's a good question.

422
00:31:04.510 --> 00:31:07.710
Different ways to say "I like you". I've never thought about that.

423
00:31:07.900 --> 00:31:14.970
I mean, I guess like, if I were to say it, depending on where I was, obviously,

424
00:31:14.970 --> 00:31:19.040
But like where I grew up, where I went to high school, for example, where I live right now.

425
00:31:20.090 --> 00:31:22.520
We would probably say, "I fuck with you".

426
00:31:22.520 --> 00:31:28.460
And when I say 'we', I'm talking about like, people that I hang out with or people like me.

427
00:31:28.460 --> 00:31:31.240
It's kind of like, when I say "I fuck with you",

428
00:31:31.240 --> 00:31:36.000
That's kind of like Ebonics or what some people know as like, "black English" or AAVE.

429
00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:39.290
There's different names for it. But that's not like a standard English expression.

430
00:31:39.290 --> 00:31:43.430
That's just like how we talk where I'm from or like how a lot of black people talk.

431
00:31:44.080 --> 00:31:47.770
So if I say I fuck with you, it means not only do I like you,

432
00:31:47.770 --> 00:31:50.490
But like, you have my respect, I think you're cool.

433
00:31:52.550 --> 00:31:55.280
You know, like we could be friends or we are friends, that type of thing.

434
00:31:55.280 --> 00:31:57.890
If I don't fuck with you, it means I don't like you, I don't respect you,

435
00:31:58.320 --> 00:32:01.240
I don't want to be near you, I don't want to hang out with you, or nothing like that.

436
00:32:01.240 --> 00:32:05.540
So if I do fuck with you, obviously that's the opposite, the positive version of that.

437
00:32:06.250 --> 00:32:09.210
So I would say don't use that like at work with somebody you don't know.

438
00:32:09.210 --> 00:32:11.660
Do not write that in the email. It's extremely informal.

439
00:32:11.660 --> 00:32:14.440
Some people might not even understand it because.

440
00:32:14.440 --> 00:32:17.740
"to fuck with you" also has a different meaning in a different context.

441
00:32:17.820 --> 00:32:19.010
And that's a universal phrase.

442
00:32:19.570 --> 00:32:21.960
So I'm probably confusing you at this point.

443
00:32:22.330 --> 00:32:25.240
But that's one way to say "I like you, I respect you, I think you're cool".

444
00:32:25.380 --> 00:32:25.910
I fuck with you.

445
00:32:26.230 --> 00:32:29.720
But it's extremely informal, and most people consider it slang,

446
00:32:29.770 --> 00:32:31.530
But it's really just a different dialect to English.

447
00:32:31.930 --> 00:32:37.820
So something standard, another way to say I like you. I think you're cool.

448
00:32:38.240 --> 00:32:40.060
I really don't know another way to say I like you.

449
00:32:40.060 --> 00:32:46.010
I would just say, "I like you". Or "you're cool" or something like that.

450
00:32:46.510 --> 00:32:49.290
I guess you're cool is a decent way to say I like you.

451
00:32:51.210 --> 00:32:59.080
Or I guess you could say it without saying it like, I enjoy your company.

452
00:33:00.250 --> 00:33:04.010
I like being around you. I enjoy your presence.

453
00:33:05.820 --> 00:33:12.410
I enjoy spending time with you. You're fun to be around or something like that.

454
00:33:12.580 --> 00:33:14.950
I mean, I really don't know another way to say I like you,

455
00:33:14.950 --> 00:33:17.290
But maybe some of those might be helpful to you.

456
00:33:18.270 --> 00:33:21.830
All right. Alo Sandoval says,

457
00:33:22.220 --> 00:33:27.200
"I guess that's better understand the English, because if you translate just the phrase or something..."

458
00:33:31.530 --> 00:33:36.260
Did she write more? Hang on. Maybe she wrote more.

459
00:33:38.990 --> 00:33:41.790
"A lot of time you're missing the context if you only translate".

460
00:33:42.080 --> 00:33:47.210
That's exactly right, and you basically expressed it a hundred times better than I ever could.

461
00:33:47.420 --> 00:33:50.610
That's what I was trying to say. I just couldn't find the words. So thank you for that.

462
00:33:50.610 --> 00:33:55.530
Because that's really what I was trying to express, is that when you're always translating

463
00:33:56.630 --> 00:34:03.420
You're ignoring the fact that context determines the meaning of the phrase. Right?

464
00:34:03.750 --> 00:34:07.160
And culture and a lot of times context and culture go hand in hand,

465
00:34:07.160 --> 00:34:10.350
But without those things, it's just words.

466
00:34:10.950 --> 00:34:14.410
And it can be interpreted in many different ways, depending on the context or culture.

467
00:34:14.410 --> 00:34:17.460
So that's exactly right. That's why it's better to just understand it.

468
00:34:17.750 --> 00:34:19.420
And it's better just to learn how to learn.

469
00:34:20.730 --> 00:34:25.720
A lot of times we like, you can't think about language like math or science where 1+1 is 2,

470
00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:33.270
Sometimes one 1+1 is 17, and it makes perfect sense. When speaking about language. Right? It makes perfect sense.

471
00:34:34.630 --> 00:34:43.280
Again, I could say, "I don't fuck with you". Like, literally in the 1+1= 2 way of thinking, it doesn't even make sense.

472
00:34:43.470 --> 00:34:47.100
I don't fuck with you. It's like that means I don't have sex with you.

473
00:34:48.390 --> 00:34:50.970
Or we don't have sex together with somebody else.

474
00:34:50.970 --> 00:34:53.530
It doesn't make literal sense. I don't fuck with you.

475
00:34:54.480 --> 00:34:57.770
Because "to fuck", the verb has many meanings.

476
00:34:57.770 --> 00:34:59.680
But like to have sex, if I don't fuck with you,

477
00:34:59.680 --> 00:35:02.120
It means that we don't fuck together. It doesn't make sense.

478
00:35:02.170 --> 00:35:06.760
But in the 1+1 is 17 way of thinking. Right?

479
00:35:06.760 --> 00:35:11.290
Which is the way you should be thinking about language, makes perfect sense to me.

480
00:35:12.350 --> 00:35:14.180
But to somebody else it doesn't, and that's the point.

481
00:35:14.180 --> 00:35:17.260
It's 1+1 is not always 2 when you're thinking about language,

482
00:35:17.260 --> 00:35:22.350
Which is why just translating all the time is slowing you down.

483
00:35:22.350 --> 00:35:25.740
You're not going to become fluent doing that for the rest of your life. You know?

484
00:35:28.080 --> 00:35:30.290
Can you explain when to use problem and issue?

485
00:35:30.640 --> 00:35:32.390
Problem and issue are the same exact thing.

486
00:35:32.420 --> 00:35:34.870
"Issue" is just a more formal way of saying "problem".

487
00:35:35.720 --> 00:35:39.970
So I guess you can use the word issue at work, in emails, and stuff like that.

488
00:35:41.440 --> 00:35:46.270
Or if you, you know, I guess, the word "problem" sounds worse,

489
00:35:46.270 --> 00:35:49.180
It has a little bit more of a negative connotation than issue.

490
00:35:49.720 --> 00:35:52.370
Because the issue is something that can be resolved, there's a solution.

491
00:35:52.370 --> 00:35:56.860
A problem is like, "fuck, we've got a problem". Just in terms of the way the words feel to me.

492
00:35:56.950 --> 00:35:58.930
I don't know if that makes sense. But they're the same thing.

493
00:35:59.340 --> 00:36:02.280
Problem, issue, informal, formal. That's it.

494
00:36:03.700 --> 00:36:10.770
So let me take one last look at these questions and comments before I get up out of here.

495
00:36:11.590 --> 00:36:13.520
*Reading in Spanish*.

496
00:36:19.240 --> 00:36:22.370
How can you refer... Different ways you can refer to somebody as friend.

497
00:36:30.310 --> 00:36:36.830
I think it depends on where you're from, what your culture is,

498
00:36:37.440 --> 00:36:40.720
And if you're referring to a man or a woman.

499
00:36:41.410 --> 00:36:45.040
So I'm going to try to think of some good examples.

500
00:36:45.840 --> 00:36:48.850
So I could say if we're talking about a guy my age, I could say,

501
00:36:48.850 --> 00:36:51.120
"that's my friend" and that's universal.

502
00:36:51.500 --> 00:36:55.830
I can say, "that's my partner" which is, like here in the south we say partner,

503
00:36:56.350 --> 00:36:57.550
But it's the word "partner".

504
00:36:58.230 --> 00:37:04.370
If I pronounce it that way, you'll probably understand P A R T N E R.

505
00:37:05.120 --> 00:37:08.840
But in the South, a lot of people say "partner", it's just a different way of pronouncing the word.

506
00:37:09.090 --> 00:37:11.850
So if I say, "that's my partner right there", that's my friend.

507
00:37:12.330 --> 00:37:16.080
Or I could say "homie" H O M I E, "that's my homie right there".

508
00:37:16.080 --> 00:37:21.550
And now partner and homie are considered very informal words. You know?

509
00:37:21.780 --> 00:37:24.980
But if you think about the meaning of the word, it just means friend.

510
00:37:25.410 --> 00:37:28.240
That's my friend. That's my partner. That's my homie. That's my boy.

511
00:37:29.060 --> 00:37:30.760
You know? So again, if you're referring to a guy,

512
00:37:31.480 --> 00:37:33.040
"that's my boy right there" that's my friend.

513
00:37:33.520 --> 00:37:36.840
You know, we're close. That's my boy. That's my partner. That's my homie.

514
00:37:37.380 --> 00:37:37.880
You know what I'm saying?

515
00:37:37.880 --> 00:37:40.760
I'm trying to think of some other ones.

516
00:37:41.640 --> 00:37:44.840
Now this, I'm going to tell you this, but I do not recommend you say this.

517
00:37:44.980 --> 00:37:48.200
I just want you to know what it means if I say, "that's my nigga",

518
00:37:49.570 --> 00:37:53.840
That also can mean that's my friend, that's my boy, that's my homie.

519
00:37:54.120 --> 00:37:56.860
I fuck with him. Going back to that same phrase.

520
00:37:56.860 --> 00:37:59.510
I fuck with him. That's my nigga. That's my homie. You know?

521
00:38:00.770 --> 00:38:01.730
That's really what it means.

522
00:38:02.050 --> 00:38:04.160
So again, I do not recommend you say that.

523
00:38:05.850 --> 00:38:08.520
Please, I mean, you say whatever you want, I'm not going to tell you what to say,

524
00:38:08.590 --> 00:38:09.710
I don't believe in that type of thing.

525
00:38:09.880 --> 00:38:16.350
I'm just saying, the word "nigga" for a lot of people is very, very, very offensive,

526
00:38:16.620 --> 00:38:22.660
To black people I mean, it's very offensive if it's being said to them by somebody that's not black.

527
00:38:23.050 --> 00:38:27.090
Now, this is a very complex and deep subject, so I won't get into it now.

528
00:38:27.870 --> 00:38:28.800
I want to stay on topic.

529
00:38:29.190 --> 00:38:32.560
But just so, you know, if I say "that's my nigga" I mean that's my friend.

530
00:38:32.640 --> 00:38:34.580
And typically I'm talking about a guy, not a girl.

531
00:38:35.150 --> 00:38:38.800
I can say "that girl is my nigga". Sometimes we say that, but most of the time it's a guy.

532
00:38:39.730 --> 00:38:42.230
Now, words for... I'm trying to think of words that we use for girls.

533
00:38:42.230 --> 00:38:43.550
In this case, I would just say friend.

534
00:38:43.550 --> 00:38:46.430
I don't know what other girls refer to their girlfriends as.

535
00:38:46.990 --> 00:38:49.520
They probably say, "My friend. That's my girl". J

536
00:38:49.520 --> 00:38:52.450
ust like we say, "that's my boy". They would say that's my girl.

537
00:38:55.160 --> 00:38:57.940
Or "my homegirl", I guess some girls might say that.

538
00:38:57.940 --> 00:38:59.270
I don't really hear it too often, though.

539
00:39:00.640 --> 00:39:05.490
But a lot of girls in my experience, especially like my age range, like 18 to 35,

540
00:39:05.490 --> 00:39:08.160
They might say, "that's my girl, that's my friend".

541
00:39:09.390 --> 00:39:12.290
I can't really think of a bunch of other words that we use for that.

542
00:39:12.860 --> 00:39:15.670
Now something much more formal it's like "colleague",

543
00:39:15.710 --> 00:39:17.090
Which is technically not a friend.

544
00:39:17.760 --> 00:39:22.720
But, you know, a colleague is somebody that you interact with on a regular basis,

545
00:39:22.720 --> 00:39:26.870
It could be at work or something like that. Most of the time it's at work.

546
00:39:27.310 --> 00:39:30.690
A colleague is somebody that you work with. That's not necessarily your friend.

547
00:39:31.050 --> 00:39:34.800
Now you could also say "associate", which again, is not a friend.

548
00:39:35.670 --> 00:39:37.050
It's kind of like something less than a friend,

549
00:39:37.050 --> 00:39:40.300
But I'm just trying to give you more formal words that aren't necessarily "friend".

550
00:39:40.870 --> 00:39:44.530
Because a friend is somebody that's close, that you trust, have a good time with,

551
00:39:44.600 --> 00:39:46.900
You have fun with them, you just want to spend time with them.

552
00:39:46.900 --> 00:39:50.240
Now an associate is somebody with whom you associate.

553
00:39:51.010 --> 00:39:54.380
You're not necessarily friends, but you have to do business with this person

554
00:39:54.380 --> 00:39:57.430
Or interact with this person for whatever reason. So it's an associate.

555
00:39:58.270 --> 00:40:04.310
Those are some words that either mean friend or are related to the word friend.

556
00:40:04.880 --> 00:40:06.110
Hopefully, that was helpful.

557
00:40:07.890 --> 00:40:16.160
Okay. HK368 says he or she, I'm not sure, doesn't understand the body count question.

558
00:40:16.800 --> 00:40:19.390
So just in case you don't understand or even know what I'm talking about,

559
00:40:19.680 --> 00:40:23.670
The body count question obviously is a question about your body count.

560
00:40:23.670 --> 00:40:31.470
So, a body count depending on the context, but in most cases, especially on social media,

561
00:40:31.470 --> 00:40:37.770
Like what most people mean when they say body count is how many people you've had sex with. That's it.

562
00:40:37.770 --> 00:40:43.060
How many bodies you have had sexual relations with or sexual interactions with. Right?

563
00:40:44.250 --> 00:40:45.780
So somebody says, "what's your body count?"

564
00:40:46.540 --> 00:40:50.130
They're asking you "how many people have you had sex with?". That's it.

565
00:40:50.940 --> 00:40:54.170
Now, in a different context, body count means how many people you've killed.

566
00:40:54.750 --> 00:40:56.490
So context is everything.

567
00:40:58.480 --> 00:41:01.970
What is the most important to talk well English?

568
00:41:04.010 --> 00:41:08.780
To talk, I say it every time. Like, maybe you've never heard me say it before.

569
00:41:09.420 --> 00:41:13.910
But if you've been following me for at least a month, you've heard me say it before for sure.

570
00:41:14.380 --> 00:41:19.060
It's the best way to speak English well or to learn to speak English well is to speak English, bro.

571
00:41:19.060 --> 00:41:22.070
That's it. That's it.

572
00:41:23.530 --> 00:41:27.520
So you need to find a teacher or a language exchange partner or a friend

573
00:41:27.520 --> 00:41:33.410
Or whatever you need to do, a human being that can tell you when you're saying something that sounds weird

574
00:41:33.410 --> 00:41:37.810
Or that's grammatically incorrect or teach you about the language, the culture,

575
00:41:37.810 --> 00:41:41.450
The expressions, help you with your pronunciation, all the type of stuff.

576
00:41:41.450 --> 00:41:43.830
But you can't do that if you're not talking to a real person.

577
00:41:44.700 --> 00:41:48.040
So find a real person and talk to them.

578
00:41:49.080 --> 00:41:54.280
Everything else is helpful, but it's secondary in comparison to the talking part.

579
00:41:54.340 --> 00:41:56.970
Like, if I asked you, "how do you learn to play soccer?". What would you say?

580
00:41:59.540 --> 00:42:01.810
If I asked you, "how do you learn to play saxophone?". What would you say?

581
00:42:05.190 --> 00:42:06.100
Practice, right?

582
00:42:06.240 --> 00:42:09.740
Take classes or a course, watch videos, and you fucking practice until you're good.

583
00:42:10.830 --> 00:42:14.090
And you get better by being around people that are better than you.

584
00:42:14.460 --> 00:42:17.870
You become a better soccer player by playing with players that play better than you.

585
00:42:19.030 --> 00:42:21.700
Not people on the same level or people that don't play as good as you.

586
00:42:21.700 --> 00:42:23.220
How could you possibly get better?

587
00:42:24.090 --> 00:42:26.960
It's people that are better than you that push you,

588
00:42:27.290 --> 00:42:33.740
That force you to become a better version of yourself or to do that skill or to improve that skill.

589
00:42:33.830 --> 00:42:36.670
Let's say, that's a better way of saying it, right? So it's the same with everything else.

590
00:42:36.670 --> 00:42:40.310
If you want to be a great musician, you have to be around musicians greater than you.

591
00:42:41.370 --> 00:42:45.050
Naturally, you're going to get inspired and notice their techniques and, you know,

592
00:42:45.440 --> 00:42:47.000
Take those things and make them your own.

593
00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:48.260
It's the same thing with language.

594
00:42:48.260 --> 00:42:51.620
So if we're talking about language, English, in this case,

595
00:42:52.350 --> 00:42:56.120
If you want to be a better English speaker, speak English to people that speak English better than you.

596
00:42:57.090 --> 00:43:00.050
Most of the time, not always, but most of the time that's a native.

597
00:43:00.990 --> 00:43:05.130
But I should also say you don't need a native to become fluent in English.

598
00:43:05.130 --> 00:43:07.340
Somebody who speaks English very well can also teach you,

599
00:43:07.340 --> 00:43:11.350
Even if it's their second, third, or fourteenth language, it doesn't really matter.

600
00:43:12.100 --> 00:43:15.080
So I think you should leave that idea to the side too if you have that in your head.

601
00:43:15.460 --> 00:43:18.830
Anybody who speaks English better than you can help you improve your English.

602
00:43:19.690 --> 00:43:26.580
So by being around and interacting with people who have a higher skill level than you in this case,

603
00:43:26.580 --> 00:43:28.640
English, you're going to improve your English.

604
00:43:31.570 --> 00:43:32.000
All right, cool.

605
00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:33.880
All right y'all, so I'm about to get out of here, man.

606
00:43:34.440 --> 00:43:36.480
My plan was to be here for an hour and it's been two.

607
00:43:36.800 --> 00:43:38.050
So hopefully y'all enjoyed the live.

608
00:43:38.430 --> 00:43:40.850
Maybe you learned some few... some few things?!

609
00:43:41.590 --> 00:43:46.110
Maybe you learned a few things or got some things to think about. You know?

610
00:43:46.660 --> 00:43:47.480
But thank you for being here.

611
00:43:47.480 --> 00:43:50.700
Thank you for your time and attention because you could have given it to anybody,

612
00:43:51.450 --> 00:43:53.150

I'm going to try to do it again, I'm going to say next Friday, I'm going to try to do it again around the same time another live stream. I can't say for sure yet, but I'm gonna try. All right. But one thing is for sure, I'll be back. All right? So what's today, Thursday? Right? Yeah, it's Thursday. So y'all have a great rest of your day or your night, Friday as well. You know what I'm saying? And hopefully, you enjoy the weekend. More videos coming soon, more lessons, more podcasts, man. I'ma holler at y'all real soon. Y'all stay safe. Take care of yourselves. And I see you when I see you. Peace!

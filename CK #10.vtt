00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:10.080
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. What's the catch? "What's the
catch?" is

2
00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:17.910
something that we say when we believe a situation or an
offer is just too good to be true. It seems too good to

3
00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:25.470
actually be real. So what we're saying is we think that
there's some hidden cost or problem or disadvantage that

4
00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:34.410
will make us regret accepting the offer. So a "catch" in
this case is the hidden problem, the hidden cost, the hidden

5
00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:42.670
disadvantage, that hidden thing you must do in order to get
the full benefits of this offer or this situation. So let me

6
00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:50.780
give you an example. Let's imagine that this English teacher
is offering free classes all month to anyone who is

7
00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:57.640
interested, and you and your friend are learning English. So
your friend sees this offer online and she gets all excited

8
00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:03.290
and she just has to tell you about it. So she tells you,
"Man, this English teacher is giving free classes to

9
00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:11.690
everyone all month. That's amazing, right?" And you, you're
a little more skeptical. And you say, "Yeah, that's cool.

10
00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:19.850
But what's the catch?" So really what you're saying is,
"Yeah, that sounds amazing, but there's no way he's just

11
00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:26.560
giving us these free classes in exchange for nothing. There
has to be some hidden cost. There has to be some hidden

12
00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:34.440
thing, some problem or disadvantage that we don't know about
because this is just too good to be true. There must be a

13
00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:42.950
catch." So after you do some research, you find out or you
discover that the only way to get that entire month of free

14
00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:51.610
English classes is to buy the book that the English teacher
is selling, and the book is $100. So that's the "catch". In

15
00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:59.450
order to get the free classes for a month, you first have to
buy this $100 book that the teacher is selling. That's the

16
00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:07.100
hidden cost, the hidden problem, the hidden disadvantage.
You know, the thing that confirms this offer is definitely

17
00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:14.360
too good to be true. Now, let me give you one more example.
Let's imagine that you want to buy a PlayStation 5. You

18
00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:20.880
don't have enough money to buy a brand new one, so you're
going to go online to see if you can find a used one that's

19
00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:26.890
in good condition. So you go on the Internet and you see
this PlayStation 5. It looks really good. And the seller,

20
00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:33.480
the person who is selling the PlayStation says, "It's brand
new. I only used it once. It's in perfect condition." And

21
00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:43.490
not only that, but the seller is selling this PlayStation 5
for just $50. $50 when the normal price of a brand new

22
00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:46.050
PlayStation 5 is $500.

23
00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:53.490
So you're all excited about this great deal, like, "Man,
this brand new or almost new PlayStation 5, this thing

24
00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:59.050
should cost $450, $500, and he's selling it for just $50?

25
00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:07.620
This is a great deal. I got to buy this!" Right? But the
catch is that the PlayStation is broken.

26
00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:14.510
You just can't see that in the pictures online. It's only
after you pay the $50 and receive the PlayStation in the

27
00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:21.780
mail and you plug everything in and you're all excited and
you try to turn it on, only then do you realize that you've

28
00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:29.260
been played, you've been deceived, you've been taken for a
ride. Only then do you realize that was the "catch", is that

29
00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:32.070
it's $50, yeah, but it's broken.

30
00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:42.610
So in summary, a "catch" in this context is a hidden cost or
problem or disadvantage in a situation that seems too good

31
00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:51.620
to be true. So whenever you're suspecting that a situation
or an offer is too good to actually be true, you can ask,

32
00:03:52.380 --> 00:04:00.500
"What's the catch?" Or you can say, "There must be a catch." 
So the first one is the question, you want to know, "What's

33
00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:06.300
the catch? What's the hidden problem or cost or
disadvantage?" And the second example, you are confirming,

34
00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:12.430
or you are, excuse me, you are affirming, you're saying,
"No, there's some hidden problem here. There must be a

35
00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:19.400
catch. There has to be some hidden cost or disadvantage here
that you're not telling me about." Now, unfortunately, I'm

36
00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:26.420
sure that at some point in time you will find yourself in a
situation in which you can use this phrase or this question.

37
00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:35.020
But at least now you know what it is, what it means, and how
to use it. So that's Coffee with Kaizen #10 in the books.

38
00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:41.630
I'll talk to you tomorrow.

39
00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:42.740
Peace!

What's up, Life in the English family? In this episode, I'm
going to tell you a quick story that might help you solve

2
00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:16.710
difficult problems and learn new skills more effectively.
Back

3
00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:23.010
in 2020 when most of us were locked inside and scared of the
virus, one of my friends had convinced me to try and learn

4
00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:28.760
JavaScript. And for those of you that don't know, JavaScript
is a programming language used to create things like

5
00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:35.660
websites, mobile apps and games, amongst other things. But
anyway, during the first few weeks of learning web

6
00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:43.340
development, I was fascinated - reading, understanding, and
writing code to communicate with the computer and make it do

7
00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:50.040
whatever I want; it seemed like magic to me. I just love the
fact that you could write codes to build whatever you want

8
00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:54.940
on the internet. The same way you can use hammers and
screwdrivers and power drills to build things in the

9
00:00:54.940 --> 00:01:03.000
physical world. The limit is quite literally, your
imagination. But after a month or two of learning the

10
00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:11.350
fundamentals and working on very basic projects, things
started to get unbelievably difficult. Functions,

11
00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:19.590
parameters, callbacks, promises, loops, arrays, methods, all
of these bits of information that served very specific

12
00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:27.860
purposes, and they needed to be chained together in order to
create a fully functional site or application. Lots of math,

13
00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:35.600
confusing tutorials, and documentation. I found myself going
down rabbit hole after rabbit hole of information until I

14
00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:42.120
got overwhelmed by it all and decided that programming just
wasn't for me which was unfortunate because I genuinely

15
00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:48.880
found it interesting and wanted to get better at it. What's
cool is even though I had given up on learning web

16
00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:55.880
development, the knowledge I had gained from that experience
ended up helping me in ways you couldn't imagine. It's the

17
00:01:55.880 --> 00:02:02.400
reason I was able to build my current website and make it
function the way it does. And also because of two fantastic

18
00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:09.070
young gentleman named Victor and Abner, shout-out to y'all,
man, y'all are fucking amazing, and I am forever in your

19
00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:14.470
debt! But let me get back to my story, because I really
think it could help you to learn difficult skills in a more

20
00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:24.470
productive and sustainable way. So fast forward to June
22...or June 2022, that's what I meant to say, I'm back

21
00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:32.580
to the basics of web development. HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
And you know what's interesting? Revisiting the basics of a

22
00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:39.220
programming language after two years of not using it feels
the same as revisiting the basics of a spoken language after

23
00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:45.550
two years of not speaking it. You can understand a few
things here and there, and a lot of words are familiar to

24
00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:51.360
you. You start using the language again, and even though you
don't remember everything, you're able to relearn the basics

25
00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:58.330
very quickly, typically within a week. And since you've got
that familiarity, you can master the fundamentals and move

26
00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:05.530
on to more complex subjects much more quickly. So you're
starting over, but you're not starting from zero. And I

27
00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:13.110
don't know why, but that feels good. It's like I've been
here before; I made my mistakes; I learned my lessons; and

28
00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:20.170
now I get the chance to try again with a fresh mind backed
by the memories from my last experience. I know I'm gonna

29
00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:28.020
learn this skill if I just keep chipping away at it,
aggressively, yet patiently. And what I mean is going hard,

30
00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:36.290
giving it everything you've got every single day, but also
knowing that you can't do more than that. So once you put in

31
00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:41.650
your work for the day, you should just shut everything down,
review what you've learned, and revisit everything the next

32
00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:48.520
day. Because you can't build a city in a week, if you know
what I mean. So my advice to you is to take the same

33
00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:56.560
approach when learning any new skill, be it communicating in
English or learning to paint, it does not matter. First of

34
00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:03.280
all, you've got to have the right mindset. Try not to think
in terms of days and weeks and instead think in terms of

35
00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:09.700
months and years, because that way you can track your
progress in a more realistic way and be patient with

36
00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:16.000
yourself. You're simply not going to become great at
something in three months. I don't give a fuck what anyone

37
00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:23.680
says. Even if you're naturally gifted, you'll still have to
practice and improve just like everyone else if you wanna be

38
00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:30.880
the best that you can possibly be. And finally, spend the
first few months constantly learning everything you can

39
00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:39.230
about the fundamentals of the skill. Play around with it.
Don't take it too seriously. Experiment. Make mistakes. Get

40
00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:45.450
feedback. Challenge yourself. All that! And eventually,
you're gonna get to a point where things start to get too

41
00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:55.200
difficult and you might consider quitting. And whenever you
reach that point, simply take a break. A long break. Don't

42
00:04:55.200 --> 00:05:03.470
even look at the subject for a week or two, or in my case, a
fucking year or two. Then come back to your studies with a

43
00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:11.790
rejuvenated mind that's had the time to digest all of that
new and interesting information. I know I talk a lot about

44
00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:20.750
studying and practicing your English every single day until
you can speak like a native. But we're all different and we

45
00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:29.200
all learn in different ways. And sometimes the best way to
learn a new skill that seems unlearnable is to stop trying

46
00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:35.960
to force it, walk away from it for a while, and come back to
it once you've forgotten how much it makes you cry.

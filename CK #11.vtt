00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:05.250
Let me explain the difference between "I used to" and "I am
used to".

2
00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:18.220
Let's start with "I used to". In English, we say "I used to
do something" when we're talking about something we did on a

3
00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:26.430
regular basis in the past. For example, "I used to play
saxophone when I was a kid", which means "When I was a kid

4
00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:34.420
for many months or many years, most likely, I played the
saxophone on a regular basis or consistently. It wasn't once

5
00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:42.160
or twice, and then I never did it again. It was for a long
period of time on a regular basis." Okay, so here's another

6
00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:49.490
example. "We used to go to our grandma's house every
summer", which most likely means when you were a kid for

7
00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:56.720
many, many years, five, ten, 15 years, every single summer,
you and your siblings, your family would go to your

8
00:00:56.720 --> 00:01:03.780
grandma's house. It wasn't just one summer. It was
consistently summer after summer after summer. Now you don't

9
00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:10.760
do it anymore. But in the past you used to do it, okay? You
did it on a regular basis. That's the idea. So here's

10
00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:18.060
another example. "He used to be the best player in the
world." "He used to be the best player in the world", which

11
00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:27.920
means at one point in time, in the past, for a long period
of time, he was the best. From 1995 to 2010 or

12
00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:35.130
something like that, he was the best. It's 2021 now. So he
"used to be", right? There was this large period of time

13
00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:40.650
where he was the best or he used to be the best, but he's
not anymore. One more example. Just to make it even more

14
00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:47.980
clear, you will hear many times somebody might say something
like, "I used to smoke." "I used to smoke, but I don't

15
00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:55.050
anymore", which means "On a regular basis for a long time I
was a smoker. I smoked a lot." You know? "I don't anymore,

16
00:01:55.050 --> 00:02:01.790
though." You can say "I smoked", but that just implies that
you did it at one time. But if you say "I used to smoke", it

17
00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:07.750
means that it was in the past. It was a habit for you. You
did it all the time, consistently, but you don't anymore.

18
00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:15.110
Alright? Now let me talk about the grammar for this phrase.
"I used to do something". In this case, you're always going

19
00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:23.510
to say "I used to" plus the infinitive form of the verb. For
example, "I used to play". You don't say "I used to

20
00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:31.040
playing", that's grammatically incorrect or another example,
"We used to go to our grandma's house." We do not say, "We

21
00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:39.550
used to going to our grandma's house" or "I used to smoke."
You don't say, "I used to smoking." So in this case,

22
00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:45.260
something that you used to do in the past, you're always
going to use the infinitive form of the verb. "I used to

23
00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:52.890
smoke", "I used to play", "I used to drink", "I used to go"
every single time. Don't use the gerund form or the -i-n-g

24
00:02:52.890 --> 00:03:01.310
form with this phrase in particular. Now let's move on to "I
am used to", which is something completely different. So we

25
00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:08.370
say "I am used to" when we're talking about something that
is normal for us or something that we are accustomed to and

26
00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:15.530
to say, "I am used to something", the way I understand it is
the same thing as saying "I am accustomed to something." So

27
00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:20.940
maybe if you speak a lot in base language, you can recognize
that word "accustomed" because it exists in your language.

28
00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:28.700
So a more natural, let's say, modern way to say that, less
formal way to say that in American English is "to be used

29
00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:35.550
to". We don't say...it's not so common to say, "I am
accustomed to this." There's nothing wrong with that, if you

30
00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:42.710
want to say that, but it's just much more informal and
natural to say, "I'm used to this." Alright? So let me give

31
00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:52.310
you some examples. Number one, "I'm used to waking up
early." "I'm used to waking up early", which basically means

32
00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:59.480
"I am accustomed to the habit of waking up early. It is
normal for me now. Maybe in the past it was very difficult

33
00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:05.280
for me to wake up in the morning. I'm not a morning person.
I'm not somebody that likes waking up early in the morning.

34
00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:12.150
I'm not somebody that naturally wakes up early in the
morning. But after doing it day after day after day, for

35
00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:19.690
weeks or months or years, now I'm used to it. Now I'm
accustomed. Now it's normal for me. It's no big deal."

36
00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:27.820
Alright? Another example. "It's okay. I'm used to being
underestimated." "It's okay.

37
00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:35.530
I'm used to being underestimated", which means, again, "It's
normal for me now. It's nothing new for me to be

38
00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:43.410
underestimated. Everyone is always underestimating me so
it's not a problem anymore. I'm used to it. It's normal. No

39
00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:52.320
big deal." Another example. "Eventually, you'll get used to
the way we do things around here." "Eventually you'll get

40
00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:58.270
used to the way we do things around here." So basically what
I'm saying is "Eventually, at some point, the way we do

41
00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:04.720
things around here will be normal for you. It's not right
now. But after doing it for so much time, day after day

42
00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:11.610
after day, you will get accustomed to it. It will be normal
for you. It will just become second nature." Let's say it

43
00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:19.770
like that. Now let's talk about the grammar for this phrase
"to be used to something". So when we say "I am used to...da

44
00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:28.400
da da", normally, we're gonna use a verb or a noun, used to
doing something or used to this particular thing. So if

45
00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:34.990
you're using a verb with this phrase, you are always going
to use the gerund form of the verb or the -i-n-g form of the

46
00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:43.030
verb. For example, "I'm used to waking up early in the
morning." You wouldn't say, "I'm used to wake up early in

47
00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:50.460
the morning." Or like the other example, "I'm used to being
underestimated." You wouldn't say, "I'm used to be

48
00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:57.890
underestimated." So just remember, if you're saying "I'm
used to doing something", some type of verb or action,

49
00:05:57.890 --> 00:06:05.170
you're going to use the gerund, the -i-n-g form. Now, if
you're using a noun, you are always going to say, "I'm used

50
00:06:05.170 --> 00:06:08.080
to the..." plus the noun.

51
00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:17.450
For example, "You will get used to the way we do things
around here", so "you will get used to" plus "the" and the

52
00:06:17.450 --> 00:06:24.570
noun in this case is "way", "the way". "You will get used to
the way we do things around here." "I will get used to the

53
00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:31.980
weather." "I will get used to the way people speak."
Hopefully you get the idea. So if it's "I'm used to" plus

54
00:06:31.980 --> 00:06:39.710
the gerund form of a verb, or "I'm used to" plus "the" and
then the noun. Alright, my friend. Now, the difference

55
00:06:39.710 --> 00:06:46.570
between the two phrases "I used to" and "I am used to"
should be clear in your mind. But like I always say, if it's

56
00:06:46.570 --> 00:06:51.660
not, leave your comments below if you're watching this on
YouTube or shoot me a message if you're just listening to

57
00:06:51.660 --> 00:06:59.980
this somewhere and I'll try to clear up any doubts that you
still have. Alright? That's Coffee with Kaizen #11 in the

58
00:06:59.980 --> 00:07:02.610
books. I'll talk to you later. Peace!

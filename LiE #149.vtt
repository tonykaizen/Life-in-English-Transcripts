00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:04.830
Tony Kaizen:
Alright, my friend. So the first question I got for you is,
if you had to listen to three albums for the rest of your

2
00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:06.430
life, which albums would they be?

3
00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:15.110
Tiger:
Uh...probably Rumours by Fleetwood Mac. Jeez, that's a hard
question to answer on the spot like that, but definitely

4
00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:21.660
Rumours by Fleetwood Mac, that's my favorite album for sure.
Uh...probably Dark Side of the Moon by Pink Floyd. I mean, I

5
00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:30.030
call...I'm always in the mood for that. And I don't know,
I'm really liking this Portugal the Man album. It's called

6
00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:37.660
uh...fuck my life. Yeah, I don't know. But there's this
Portugal...it's like, man, it's a long...it's a long name.

7
00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:42.520
It's like, "mountain on a cloud", something like that. It's
like, the album cover's, like, purple with, like, a dude and

8
00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:45.940
so misty. It's pretty cool. I really like all the songs on
there. I've listened to that a lot.

9
00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:47.660
Tony Kaizen:
And what's it called? The name of the album?

10
00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:48.280
Tiger:
I can look it up.

11
00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:49.220
Tony Kaizen:
Uh the...the artist I mean.

12
00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:50.150
Tiger:
Portugal. The Man.

13
00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:51.200
Tony Kaizen:
Portugal. The Man.

14
00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:52.920
Tiger:
Yeah. They're like a rock band from Alaska.

15
00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.040
Tony Kaizen:
Oh, okay. Interesting name.

16
00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:57.770
Tiger:
Yeah, they're...They were at Shaky Knees a couple of years
ago.

17
00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:01.570
Tony Kaizen:
Portugal. The Man. Yeah, just like actually describing the
cover, now I want to go check it out or something.

18
00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:07.190
Tiger:
It's a nice song. Yeah. I'm into, like, indie alternative
rock kind of stuff, so, they're like right up my alley.

19
00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:09.480
Tony Kaizen:
Yeah, do you like Blink, Green Day, that type of stuff, too?

20
00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:14.060
Tiger:
I listened to Green Day back in the day, uh you know, while
I was going through my angsty seventh grade, you know,

21
00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:19.050
puberty phase. Blink 182 I can never really get into,
they're a little bit too much for me, but Green Day for

22
00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:21.400
sure. Like, I'll listen to that shit nonstop. Yeah. Yeah.

23
00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:25.730
Tony Kaizen:
Okay, nice man. Alright. So my next question is, what are
three things that you cannot live without?

24
00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:30.500
Tiger:
Three things I cannot live without? Besides, like, the
obvious, like, food and water?

25
00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:30.900
Tony Kaizen:
Yeah,exactly.

26
00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:36.540
Tiger:
I don't know...like, but can it be more...like, what are
other answers...?

27
00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:44.750
Tony Kaizen:
Let me think of a different way to ask the question. What
are...if you could only take three things to a desert island

28
00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:48.160
that you were gonna stay on for the next 18 months, what
would you take with you?

29
00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:57.320
Tiger:
Oh okay, I'd probably take...I'd probably take an MP3 player
with some of my favorite songs. I would take...I

30
00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:07.370
mean, I'd take books, but I guess I had to choose one book?
Is that...is that part of the...dang! Yeah, that's hard.

31
00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:10.460
Tony Kaizen:
What type of stuff do you like to read? What genre?

32
00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:16.390
Tiger:
I mean, I like to read non-fiction, but it's like you can't
reread non-fiction. You know what I mean? Like, like like I

33
00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:23.370
read...I read autobiographies, you know, I read non-fiction
stuff. Like, I read, you know, like I read this one book

34
00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:28.880
recently. It's about...it's about the dude that created the
Silk Road. It's called American Linchpin King...American

35
00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:34.190
Kingpin. Uh but it's like once you read it, like it's, you
know...You know all the things that happen so it's like

36
00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:43.350
you're not going to reread it. I guess my favorite fiction
book I've read... Honestly, I really liked uh...A

37
00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:49.000
Tale of Two Cities by Charles Dickens when I was growing up.
I can probably reread that book. I can probably read that

38
00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.730
one a good bout. And then...what else do I bring on the
desert island with me?

39
00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:54.960
Tony Kaizen:
So you got music, books. What's the third thing?

40
00:02:55.830 --> 00:03:04.960
Tiger:
I don't know. I'll probably bring...I'll probably bring
like, the first 15 seasons of The Simpsons with me.

41
00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:06.240
That was my favorite show growing up.

42
00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:06.490
Tony Kaizen:
Okay.

43
00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:12.710
Tiger:
I'll watch every single episode of The Simpsons when I was a
kid cos like, that came on at like 5:00. My parents got home

44
00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:19.760
from work at 5:30, so I always like, I always watch...like
yeah. And like, it was like, from like probably fourth

45
00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:26.330
grade, to like eighth grade, and like every day after school
I just watch The Simpsons when it came on Fox at 5:00. And

46
00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:29.780
then yeah, as soon as I heard the garage door open, I just
run to my room pretending I was doing homework all the time.

47
00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:32.560
But yeah, I'll probably bring those things with me.

48
00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:38.760
Tony Kaizen:
Have you ever put any thought into the...the idea that...or
the reason that they're so good at predicting so many things

49
00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:39.190
on that show?

50
00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:44.980
Tiger:
I mean, it's just there's so many episodes and they just,
you know, like they just do so many things. I feel like just

51
00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:50.530
by sheer chance, just yeah, it's just random. And also, I
mean, there's like throughout history, there's always common

52
00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:54.670
themes. Like there's always going to be like the asshole
dictator that takes over power, like Trump or whatever.

53
00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:55.000
Tony Kaizen:
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

54
00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:03.880
Tiger:
There's always going to be like common motifs, like
corporate greed, you know, cheat on your wife, lust. You

55
00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:04.880
know, that just happens...

56
00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:05.230
Tony Kaizen:
That's true.

57
00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:06.670
...over time anyway. So yeah.

58
00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:07.850
Yeah. Alright.

59
00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:13.430
So my next question is, if all jobs paid the same and you
could do any job starting tomorrow, which job would you do?

60
00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:20.680
Tiger:
I'd probably be like a sports journalist of some sort. I
really like sports. The thing is, like growing up, I was

61
00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:28.010
always good at math and science and I sucked at English, you
know? So it's really ironic that I would say that. But, but

62
00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:33.600
like, I've like...as I've grown up, I've gained an
appreciation for good writing and good novels and good

63
00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:42.220
storytelling. So yeah, I mean, I would want to do something
where it's like I'm kind of like expressing my opinion about

64
00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:48.070
something and like kind of adding value to yeah...cos I
don't know, like I feel like especially in mainstream media,

65
00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:53.430
like you don't really hear a lot of like you don't have a
lot of Chinese-Americans or Asian Americans in general, like

66
00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:58.900
in mainstream media expressing like their experience in
life. Like right now it's like, you know, like black people

67
00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:06.880
are having their moment, you know, like um...everyone has
their turn, right? But it's like, you know, you see a lot

68
00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:13.070
of...you see a lot of movies like, with like where they're
hiring like more black actors and actresses and whatnot. But

69
00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:18.570
yeah, I feel like American...like, like Asians that grew up
in America are way different than Asians that grew up in

70
00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:18.800
Asia...

71
00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:19.130
Tony Kaizen:
Hundred percent.

72
00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:27.470
Tiger:
You know? And I feel like that subsection of American life
is not really represented 100% right now. So, yeah.

73
00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:33.750
Tony Kaizen:
Out of curiosity, what would you say are some of the main
differences between Asians born and raised in the US and

74
00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:35.410
Asians from their respective countries?

75
00:05:35.410 --> 00:05:41.070
Tiger:
Dude, everything. Like the way we view, the way we view the
world, like the way like...we interact with people like,

76
00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:47.170
like...Asian like...so like for instance, I'm not like, I'm
Chinese-American. I moved here around six years old, but I'm

77
00:05:47.170 --> 00:05:53.020
American as like, anyone around here. But like, like, for
instance, I can't really make friends with Chinese-Chinese

78
00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:58.420
people because first of all, the language barrier, and
second of all, like, again, like when you grow up in China

79
00:05:58.480 --> 00:06:04.130
in like a communist regime and all that stuff, they just
view the world differently. And also the people that are

80
00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:11.020
able to make it from China to here after a certain point in
time, especially the kids that come here for college, so

81
00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:16.790
they're like, you know, 20...18 to 20 years old when they
come over here, um...usually those type of kids are

82
00:06:16.790 --> 00:06:21.230
only...are super rich. Like they're only like...they're
pretty much only allowed to come here cos they can afford

83
00:06:21.230 --> 00:06:27.980
it. So obviously I can't relate with that because I grew up
kind of poor growing up. And yeah, just, you know, just

84
00:06:28.140 --> 00:06:33.430
cultural stuff like, you know, pop culture references,
jokes...just like general American, you know, whatever, like

85
00:06:33.430 --> 00:06:38.230
they're not going to understand cos again, they grew up in
China, so it's like, it's hard to...Anyway, I can't really

86
00:06:38.230 --> 00:06:41.700
connect with them and all that stuff, like, I didn't grow up
in, I didn't grow up in China like they did.

87
00:06:41.850 --> 00:06:41.990
Tony Kaizen:
Right.

88
00:06:42.310 --> 00:06:43.600
Tiger:
So, so yeah.

89
00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:50.570
It's just, you know, you naturally hang out with people you
have common beliefs and whatever with. For me, it's American

90
00:06:50.710 --> 00:06:54.360
kids cos I'm, you know, I grew up...I grew up in Texas and
you know, so yeah.

91
00:06:54.860 --> 00:07:01.150
Tony Kaizen:
Have you ever had any experience where maybe you got treated
differently or even worse by Chinese people from China

92
00:07:01.150 --> 00:07:04.210
because you're not like a real Chinese person or things like
that?

93
00:07:04.630 --> 00:07:09.330
Tiger:
Oh, kinda. I mean, like...my Chinese is terrible, right? So
like, so like they'll make fun of you for, like, not

94
00:07:09.330 --> 00:07:15.370
speaking proper Chinese because it's like, you're like,
losing your heritage or whatever, which is like a big thing

95
00:07:15.370 --> 00:07:21.660
to them. So yeah, I mean, they'll like, make fun of you for
it, but it's like, dude, I don't know, I can't. Yeah, you

96
00:07:21.660 --> 00:07:26.620
know, I got...I live in America. All my friends are white.
Like, I have no one to speak Chinese with except my parents,

97
00:07:26.640 --> 00:07:28.080
you know? So it is what it is.

98
00:07:28.080 --> 00:07:31.330
Tony Kaizen:
Did they, like, force you to learn it when you were a kid?
Did they speak Chinese at home when you were a kid?

99
00:07:31.500 --> 00:07:36.250
Tiger:
They speak...so the thing is, they spoke English to me when
I was a kid, because they wanted me to become as American as

100
00:07:36.250 --> 00:07:42.800
possible, as quickly as possible, so I can like get along
with people in school and like...like I remember, so I

101
00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:48.820
remember when I first started kindergarten and even first
grade, I barely understood anything my teacher was saying to

102
00:07:48.820 --> 00:07:54.660
me. And I basically like, like just get through the day just
by, like, following all the other kids around and just like,

103
00:07:54.660 --> 00:07:58.260
"Oh, it's lunch time, I guess. Yeah, I guess everyone's
going to the lunchroom. I guess we're eating lunch again",

104
00:07:58.480 --> 00:08:04.300
you know? It's one...like one of those things. I remember,
like, one of my first memories in first grade was like

105
00:08:04.300 --> 00:08:11.480
so...in, in our like table that we sat at, there was always
like a basket full of books that you can like, just kind of

106
00:08:11.520 --> 00:08:16.270
browse and read in your free time. And I remember just like
flipping through the pages and just not understand a single

107
00:08:16.270 --> 00:08:22.270
fucking word, you know? And I just would just literally look
at the pictures and just kind of flip through 'em, and

108
00:08:22.270 --> 00:08:27.290
like...and all the other kids, like, you know, they grew up
with, you know, in America. They could speak...or read

109
00:08:27.290 --> 00:08:32.920
English little bit quicker than I could. So yeah, just stuff
like that. Um, you know, it was a little hard growing up.

110
00:08:33.360 --> 00:08:37.350
Tony Kaizen:
Did the kids, like, pick on you and make fun of you because
you couldn't speak the same level of English?

111
00:08:37.400 --> 00:08:42.160
Tiger:
Well, yeah, everyone gets bullied. I mean, I got bullied. I
feel like everyone gets bullied growing up. But yeah, you

112
00:08:42.160 --> 00:08:46.090
know, it's an easy...it's an easy target, you know, Chinese
kid and can't really speak English, small, whatever.

113
00:08:46.130 --> 00:08:50.790
Tony Kaizen:
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I got it. I got it. Alright. So my next
question for you is, you mentioned the difference between

114
00:08:50.790 --> 00:08:56.860
like Chinese-Americans and Chinese people from China, so how
would you describe American people because we really are

115
00:08:56.860 --> 00:08:59.310
like a melting pot? So when I say that, what comes to mind?

116
00:09:00.900 --> 00:09:05.970
Tiger:
Nothing in particular, to be honest, cos again, yeah,
America is a melting pot. Like, like us, we're staying right

117
00:09:05.970 --> 00:09:11.490
here, like this would never happen anywhere else in the
world, you know? So yeah, I mean, I don't know. I can't

118
00:09:11.490 --> 00:09:18.870
really just...you can't really define an American. It's
funny as so, like, so...like so in Chinese culture, food is

119
00:09:18.870 --> 00:09:24.000
very important, right? And obviously, Chinese food is a very
distinct, you know, cuisine. And, you know, even different

120
00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:28.230
regions have different type of foods. So like...and with
Americans, we don't have like...an American...

121
00:09:28.230 --> 00:09:28.510
Tony Kaizen:
Exactly.

122
00:09:28.510 --> 00:09:29.890
Tiger:
...there's no such thing as American food.

123
00:09:29.890 --> 00:09:31.310
Tony Kaizen:
Like fast food, it's pretty much...

124
00:09:31.310 --> 00:09:38.110
Tiger:
I guess burgers, but it's like...but even burgers weren't
even invented in America. But so it's like...like, yeah, I

125
00:09:38.110 --> 00:09:44.180
don't think America has a certain identity in a way. It's
just, it's just a hodgepodge of everything. And the common

126
00:09:44.180 --> 00:09:48.680
thing is everyone just wants to live the best life they can.
That's the one thing that's really in common with everyone.

127
00:09:49.430 --> 00:09:49.790
So yeah.

128
00:09:50.290 --> 00:09:55.040
Tony Kaizen:
Do you think that's helpful or hurtful to the culture that
that idea that you can kind of be free to do whatever you

129
00:09:55.040 --> 00:10:00.470
want and be whoever you want, or you feel like it would be
more advantageous to take, let's say a Chinese way of

130
00:10:00.470 --> 00:10:04.100
viewing the world, which is we need to be a community and we
need to assimilate and things of that nature?

131
00:10:05.630 --> 00:10:13.320
Tiger:
That's tough, because like...like there's pros and cons to
both like, like Chinese culture....like, yeah, I guess it is

132
00:10:13.410 --> 00:10:20.740
better for certain aspects when everyone looks the same and
acts the same and like has a common, I guess, whatever

133
00:10:20.740 --> 00:10:21.670
binding 'em together.

134
00:10:21.860 --> 00:10:22.620
Tony Kaizen:
Set of values?

135
00:10:22.620 --> 00:10:30.130
Tiger:
Yeah. Yeah. Which is, which is how the Communist Party is so
effective over there, you know, cos it's like, "Oh well, if

136
00:10:30.130 --> 00:10:34.560
you're not locked down for three months cos of COVID, you're
not...you're not a real Chinese person. You're not...you're

137
00:10:34.560 --> 00:10:38.780
not loyal to the government, you're not loyal to your
people." But at the same time, it's like, I like America cos

138
00:10:38.780 --> 00:10:45.070
like, you can kind of like take bits and pieces of other
people's culture and just kind of take what you...what you

139
00:10:46.230 --> 00:10:51.590
value and what you think is right, and just make it your
own. Like, for instance, like Chinese people, it's a pretty

140
00:10:51.590 --> 00:10:56.850
misogynistic culture for the most part, or at least maybe
not this generation, but for a long time it was. So it's

141
00:10:56.850 --> 00:11:03.020
like, I don't know, like growing up as a kid, like if you're
in China, like, that's just how you treat women and that's

142
00:11:03.020 --> 00:11:09.120
how you treat people, right? Cos that's how everyone else
did it. But in America, it's like, "Okay, well, Joe,"...the

143
00:11:09.870 --> 00:11:13.920
white people...Like they're nice to their kids or like
whatever, like, they play baseball. Like they don't have to

144
00:11:13.920 --> 00:11:15.720
study their SATs starting from third grade.

145
00:11:15.720 --> 00:11:16.110
Tony Kaizen:
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

146
00:11:16.200 --> 00:11:21.710
Tiger:
So, like, maybe that's a better way to raise a family. I
don't know. So, so you can like kind of take bits and pieces

147
00:11:21.710 --> 00:11:26.080
of other people you meet and kind of like, just, you know,
like try to make the best out of it. That's how I see it.

148
00:11:26.660 --> 00:11:28.790
Tony Kaizen:
Okay. Nice, man. Give me your name again.

149
00:11:28.910 --> 00:11:29.340
Tiger:
I'm Tiger.

150
00:11:29.530 --> 00:11:32.380
Tony Kaizen:
Tiger. Okay. Tiger, thank you, man. We appreciate your time.

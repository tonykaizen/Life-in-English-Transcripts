00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:05.560
In this episode, I'm going to tell you what Kobe Bryant can teach you about becoming fluent in English.

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:18.360
A lot of people know Kobe Bryant holds a lot of professional records, and he has a lot of accomplishments in the NBA.

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:25.010
In my humble opinion, he's the best basketball player to ever participate in the National Basketball Association.

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:30.820
Now, obviously, that's up for debate. I know not everybody is a Kobe fan. Some people are insane.

5
00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:36.710
But even still, I can respect any difference of opinion when it comes to the best player of all time.

6
00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:38.750
And that's not the point of this episode, right?

7
00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:47.230
Now, even if you don't know a single thing about Kobe Bryant, you've probably heard his name and you probably know that he was an extremely talented player.

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:51.110
I mean, a 20-year career with the Los Angeles Lakers,

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:53.730
5 NBA Championship titles,

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:55.470
Multiple MVP awards,

00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:59.300
Multiple 50-point games, multiple 60-point games.

00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:05.900
This man scored more points than any other Lakers player in the history of the team.

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:13.890
Let me say that again in the history of the Los Angeles Lakers from the time they became a team until today,

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:18.520
no man has ever scored more points for the Lakers than Kobe Bryant.

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:21.070
But you know what people don't talk about?

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:29.810
Kobe Bryant has also missed more shots than any other man in the history of the National Basketball Association.

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:35.680
Fourteen thousand, four hundred and eighty-one shots to be exact.

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:38.760
Let me say that again.

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:47.150
Kobe Bryant, during his career, missed fourteen thousand, four hundred and eighty-one shots.

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:56.990
That's a lot of missed shots. And yet Kobe is still known as one of the best players of all time.

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:59.680
How's that possible?

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:07.840
If you didn't know who Kobe was and somebody told you that a player had missed 14,000 shots during his career,

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:10.760
you'd probably call that guy a loser. Right?

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:13.250
You probably say that guy sucks.

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:19.590
Even if you don't know anything about basketball, 14,000 just sounds like a huge number, doesn't it?

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:27.890
So how is it the guy who was known as the best actually has one of the worst records in the history of the sport?

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:35.630
I think it's because even though he missed so many shots during his career, he never stopped shooting the ball.

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:39.570
In other words, he never stopped trying.

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:43.390
And at the end of it all, that's what people remember him for.

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:45.770
Now, let me ask you this.

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:51.390
Have you ever heard Kobe Bryant publicly apologizing for trying?

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:56.470
Have you ever heard anybody publicly apologize for trying?

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:05.940
Imagine if Kobe apologized to all his fans and his teammates and his coaches and the team owner every time he missed a shot.

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:11.570
That'd be ridiculous, wouldn't it?

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:16.250
So why are you apologizing every time you make a mistake when you're speaking English?

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:19.030
You weren't born speaking English.

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:23.680
In fact, nobody was. We all had to learn our native languages.

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:30.490
The difference here is that you are learning a second or maybe a third or maybe even a fourth language. Right?

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:37.120
So it's obvious to me that you're not going to understand every single thing that an English speaker says to you in a conversation.

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:44.900
And it's also obvious to me that you're not going to be able to express yourself exactly the way you would like in every moment of every conversation.

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:49.980
But the fact of the matter is you're trying. Right?

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:52.170
You're trying to learn something new.

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:56.230
You're trying to do something that many people will never do in their lifetime.

44
00:03:57.670 --> 00:03:59.440
And what reason do you have to apologize for that?

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:08.460
Think about when a foreigner is trying to speak your native language and they make some grammatical mistake or they say something strange that doesn't make much sense.

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:11.720
Do you sit there waiting for them to apologize?

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:18.040
Do you get mad that they don't speak your native language as well as you do?

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:20.490
Most likely not. I hope not.

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:24.880
Instead, you probably have an idea of what they're trying to say,

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:30.170
And then you ask them to explain themselves a little bit better or explain themselves in a different way.

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:32.500
No big deal, right?

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:36.550
Well, I'm here to tell you it's the same thing when you're speaking English.

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:42.350
Of course, you're going to find people that would try to make you feel bad for not speaking perfect English.

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:48.930
And of course, you might find yourself in some stressful situations because you can't express yourself the way you need to.

00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:50.380
But who cares?

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:53.730
Adversity and challenges are a part of life,

00:04:54.430 --> 00:05:00.500
and it's what you do in the moment of adversity that defines you, not the moment of adversity itself.

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:07.580
In other words, you are not what happens to you. You are how you react to what happens to you.

00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:15.420
Nobody missed more shots or made more mistakes than Kobe Bryant. Nobody.

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:20.060
And yet still, he retired a champion and a legend.

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:25.240
That was not an accident. That was not a coincidence.

00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:30.380
That was a choice that he made consciously... every day.

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:34.150
He didn't wake up on Monday and say, "I'm going to be great, I'm going to be the best."

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:37.600
And that was the end of it. He woke up again on Tuesday and said,

00:05:37.670 --> 00:05:39.760
"I'm going to be great. I'm going to be the best."

00:05:39.970 --> 00:05:42.300
And then Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday.

00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:45.880
For over 20 years, well over 20 years,

00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:51.220
Because he started playing basketball and got on the path to greatness well before he joined the NBA. Right?

00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:56.680
It was a conscious choice to be great every single day.

00:05:57.820 --> 00:06:02.430
So you know what you gotta do when you make a mistake and things don't go the way you planned?

00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:07.960
Be like Kobe, just grab the ball and take another shot.

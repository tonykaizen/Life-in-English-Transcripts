Hey! What's up, man?

7
00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:01.180
I just want to thank you for not practicing your English.

8
00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:04.710
Since you decided to give up on your goal of becoming fluent

9
00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:09.370
I was able to get into the last available spot in Tony Kaizen's group classes.

10
00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:14.890
He's such a great teacher. He's the main reason I got into the exchange program.

11
00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:19.370
You know, that program we have been dreaming about for so long.

12
00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:22.150
It's too bad you couldn't go with me.

13
00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:26.220
Anyway, you won't believe this.

14
00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:30.220
With all the stuff I learned from Tony I was able to express myself

15
00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:32.440
And make friends during my time in the U.S.

16
00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:36.380
I met some really cool guys who work for a multinational company,

17
00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:38.650
And they ended up helping me get a job there.

18
00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:44.630
The company sponsored my visa and now I'm living in sunny San Diego, California.

19
00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:48.900
Just 10 minutes from the beach. It really is like a dream.

20
00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:53.750
Moving to California was your dream, wasn't it?

21
00:01:56.110 --> 00:02:01.680
Anyway, I made a great connection with my boss and he taught me so much about life and business.

22
00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:05.520
He even explained to me what I needed to do in order to start my own business.

23
00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:09.720
It was scary at first, but after so much time speaking in English

24
00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:11.240
And learning about American culture,

25
00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:13.950
I knew I'd be able to make great business connections

26
00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:17.880
And sell directly to the customers who love my products and services.

27
00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:20.270
After just a few short years,

28
00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:24.090
I hired a sales team and a few managers to run the business for me.

29
00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:27.380
Now I only work about 10 hours a week

30
00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:31.400
And I spend the rest of my time traveling the world like I always dreamed about.

31
00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:36.730
Traveling the world was your dream too, wasn't it?

32
00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:41.880
Anyway, I'm just calling to say thank you, man.

33
00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:44.310
If you hadn't given up on your dream,

34
00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:47.170
I never would have been able to take those classes with Tony,

35
00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:53.250
Qualify for the exchange program, find a job, start a business, or travel the world.

36
00:02:54.370 --> 00:03:00.120
It's all thanks to your lack of dedication that I could take advantage of your missed opportunity.

37
00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:05.840
Thank you so much for not practicing your English. Peace!

00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:05.590
Tony Kaizen:
What's up, my friend? You already know you're listening to
the Life in English podcast. I'm your host, Tony Kaizen, and

2
00:00:05.590 --> 00:00:11.520
today I've got an entertaining episode for you. We're going
to be listening to a hilarious 911 phone call from a woman

3
00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:17.740
who was having some domestic violence issues. Now, before
you get triggered, it goes without saying that there's

4
00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:23.040
nothing inherently funny about domestic violence, but I'm
sure that by the end of this episode, you'll see that there

5
00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:28.970
are times when it can be extremely comical. So let's not
waste any time, my friend. I'm going to play the audio clip

6
00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:29.420
now.

7
00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:34.450
Mike Forbes (911 dispatcher):
"911, what is your emergency?"

8
00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:38.420
Woman:
"Yes, um, I need a police officer over here at 7..."

9
00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:39.210
Mike Forbes (911 dispatcher):
"What's going on?"

10
00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:45.790
Woman:
"Um, I've got two teenage daughters and I just got home from
work.

11
00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:51.830
They were, um, physically fighting with each other, and one
of them kicked a hole in the door. And, um, they're 12 and

12
00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:58.500
almost 14. And the 12-year-old is completely out of control.
And I...I can't...physically, if she's as big as I am, I

13
00:00:58.500 --> 00:00:59.360
can't control her."

14
00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:02.510
Mike Forbes (911 dispatcher):
"Okay. Did you want us to come over and shoot her? Are you
there?"

15
00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:05.390
Woman:
"Excuse me?"

16
00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:07.980
Mike Forbes (911 dispatcher):
"Uh, that's a joke.

17
00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:09.260
Okay, so..."

18
00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:10.640
Woman:
"Who are you? What is your name?"

19
00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:11.330
Mike Forbes (911 dispatcher):
"Mike Forbes."

20
00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:13.870
Tony Kaizen:
Oh, shit.

21
00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:19.720
Alright, my friend. First of all, let me say, don't feel bad
if you couldn't understand everything from this clip because

22
00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:25.200
the audio wasn't so good and their accent is very different
from mine. So that's what we're about to talk about now. I'm

23
00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:30.000
going to highlight some details that might be useful to you.
Alright? So the first thing you might have noticed about the

24
00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.890
short dialogue is the accent of the people who are speaking,
particularly the woman. She's got that classic Southern

25
00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:42.210
American accent, you know? It sounds like she might be from
Alabama or Georgia or Florida, but I'm not really sure. And

26
00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:47.180
you might be asking yourself, but how do you know that,
Tony? How do you know where she's from? And there are a few

27
00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:52.860
things that you can listen for that will let you know that
someone might be from the southern United States. For

28
00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:58.510
example, in this clip, you might be able to notice a pattern
in the way the woman pronounces the words that have an "e-r"

29
00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:00.240
or an "o-r" sound.

30
00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:09.420
Woman:
"Um, I've got two teenage daughters and I just got home from
work. They were, um, physically fighting with each other,

31
00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:17.460
and one of them kicked a hole in the door. And, um, they're
12 and almost 14. And the 12-year-old is completely out of

32
00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:21.180
control. And I...I can't...physically, if she's as big as I
am, I can't control her."

33
00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:27.270
Tony Kaizen:
So you see, the way she pronounces these words is different
from the way I pronounce it. I would say "daughter", "work",

34
00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:33.740
"were", "other", "door", "fourteen", "your", and you might
also be able to notice a pattern in the way she pronounces

35
00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:36.960
the "o" in words like "whole" and "control".

36
00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:41.740
Woman:
"They were, um, physically fighting with each other and one
of them kicked a hole in the door."

37
00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:48.680
Tony Kaizen:
And you might notice the way she says things like, "Excuse
me", or "Who are you?" and "What's your name?". It sounds

38
00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:51.550
completely different from the way that I might say it, you
know?

39
00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:53.750
Mike Forbes (911 dispatcher):
"Are you there?"

40
00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:54.810
Woman:
"Excuse me?"

41
00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:57.100
Mike Forbes (911 dispatcher):
"Uh, that's a joke. Okay, so..."

42
00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:58.480
Woman:
"Who are you? What is your name?"

43
00:02:58.480 --> 00:02:59.170
Mike Forbes (911 dispatcher):
"Mike Forbes."

44
00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:07.650
Tony Kaizen:
And this is what we refer to as the Southern twang. It's
just this particular, like, sound that you only hear in the

45
00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:14.150
south of the United States, the way people pronounce their
words here. It's very drawn out, and, you know, it almost

46
00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:20.700
sounds like they're singing a song and they say things like
"work" and "talk" and "walk". And this is a stereotypical

47
00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:27.670
Southern accent, but I'm trying, you know what I mean? It's
not the best but I think if I had some more practice, I

48
00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:33.860
think I'll sound a little bit like George Bush, the former
president of the United States of America. You got to love

49
00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:40.500
America... Like this. It's that twang, bro. It's like that
Texas, Louisiana, Alabama, you know what I'm

50
00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:45.960
saying...Georgia, some parts of Florida. This is how people
talk, you know? And that's one kind of Southern accent.

51
00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:53.440
There's many different kinds. Right? So anyway, maybe this
isn't the best explanation of the accent and what makes it

52
00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:58.970
unique, but hopefully you can identify those patterns in her
speech and then look out for them in the future. And I'll

53
00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:04.980
definitely make some more episodes about accents and
dialects, uh, in the near future. Alright? But now, let's go

54
00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:11.790
back to the beginning of the clip and analyze the actual
vocabulary. Alright? So the first thing, "What is your

55
00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:12.610
emergency?"

56
00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:15.710
Mike Forbes (911 dispatcher):
"911, what is your emergency?"

57
00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:21.880
Tony Kaizen:
This is a common thing for a dispatcher to say when they
answer a 911 phone call. Right? And just in case you're

58
00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:28.390
wondering, a dispatcher, according to the dictionary, is a
person whose job is to receive messages and organize the

59
00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:35.330
movement of people or vehicles, especially in the emergency
services. And that's a very wordy and, you know, kind of

60
00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:41.960
formal definition. So another way of saying that is a
dispatcher is a person who sends something to a destination.

61
00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:48.930
And in this case, it's phone calls because maybe you call
911 but there's many different reasons you might call. In

62
00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:53.820
one situation, it might be an armed robbery; in the other
situation, somebody is having a heart attack. So when you

63
00:04:53.820 --> 00:05:00.690
call 911, they're going to reroute or redirect your phone
call to the proper organization. You see what I'm saying? In

64
00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:06.620
one case, they might redirect your call to an ambulance or
the fire station and another call is to the police. You see

65
00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:13.250
what I'm saying? So the person who redirects those phone
calls in this case is the dispatcher. Alright, so next is

66
00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:15.850
"over here". Let's listen to that line one more time.

67
00:05:18.670 --> 00:05:22.370
Woman:
"Yes, um, I need a police officer over here at 7..."

68
00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:23.160
Mike Forbes (911 dispatcher):
"What's going on?"

69
00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:31.570
Tony Kaizen:
You might be asking yourself, "Why did she say 'over here'
instead of just 'here'?" Well, when we use the word "over"

70
00:05:31.730 --> 00:05:37.140
before words like "here" and "there", we're implying that a
significant distance needs to be traveled for one to arrive

71
00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:43.800
"here" or "there". So in this case, the dispatcher and the
woman are very far away from each other. So she says "over

72
00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:50.090
here", implying that they'll have to get in their cars and
travel to her house. A distance needs to be crossed, you

73
00:05:50.090 --> 00:05:57.070
see? So what you can think about is like those old Mortal
Kombat movies when Scorpion, he had that weird snake-like

74
00:05:57.070 --> 00:06:04.030
spiky thing coming out of his hand and he would yell, "Get
over here!" You guys remember that? And he would like,

75
00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:11.400
pierce the victim, I guess, and the victim would be
across the room and he would pull the victim over to the

76
00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:18.250
other side of the room. He would have to travel or cross
over that distance. Hopefully that makes sense. So you might

77
00:06:18.250 --> 00:06:23.210
still be asking yourself, "What's the difference between
'here' and 'over here'"? "What is a phrase like, 'Come here'

78
00:06:23.250 --> 00:06:29.060
mean, and why should I say 'Come here' instead of 'Come over
here?'" Well, "come here" is typically said when we're

79
00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:34.970
physically close to someone, like, in the same room,
relatively close to each other, it's...and it's typically

80
00:06:34.970 --> 00:06:41.240
used as a command. It's a very direct thing to say. And the
emphasis isn't on the distance being crossed. It's on the

81
00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:47.020
fact that "I want you here right now". "Come here, now,
immediately." You see what I'm saying? And this is one of

82
00:06:47.020 --> 00:06:52.320
those details that's really hard to explain because all the
rules and exceptions involved in this just kind of like make

83
00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:59.960
it more confusing than helpful when I try to explain it to
you, you know? But I want you to understand that English

84
00:06:59.960 --> 00:07:05.410
speakers tend to say a lot of things with reference to their
geographical location. That's what I want you to understand.

85
00:07:05.410 --> 00:07:12.000
For example, we have a habit of saying "down here in the
South" when referring to the Southern United States. And I

86
00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:20.260
say "down here", because I am here and here is at the bottom
of the map of the United States. So I say "down here". And

87
00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:26.370
if I were referring to people in New York, I could say "up
there in New York", because they're located above me

88
00:07:26.370 --> 00:07:31.780
geographically, they're up at the top of the map. You see
what I'm saying? So I'm really hoping this explanation was

89
00:07:31.780 --> 00:07:37.340
more helpful than confusing. But feel free to leave any
questions or doubts you have on the Discord server. Alright?

90
00:07:37.850 --> 00:07:42.000
Now, let's move on. The next one is "what's going on?"

91
00:07:43.550 --> 00:07:46.080
Woman:
"Yes, um, I need a police officer over here at 7..."

92
00:07:46.730 --> 00:07:48.040
Mike Forbes (911 dispatcher):
"What's going on?"

93
00:07:49.520 --> 00:07:54.920
Tony Kaizen:
This is another way of asking, "What's happening?" So if
something is "going on", something is happening. Now,

94
00:07:54.920 --> 00:08:00.650
another variation of this question might be, "What's wrong?"
or "What's the problem?" or "What's the issue?" Right? And

95
00:08:00.650 --> 00:08:06.960
in this case, you're just trying to understand what is the
situation so that I can help you. Alright, next is

96
00:08:06.960 --> 00:08:07.770
"teenage".

97
00:08:09.290 --> 00:08:14.530
Woman:
"Um, I've got two teenage daughters and I just got home from
work."

98
00:08:14.900 --> 00:08:21.670
Tony Kaizen:
"I've got two teenage daughters." The word "teenage" is used
to refer to adolescents between the ages of 13 and 19; it's

99
00:08:21.670 --> 00:08:25.700
literally an adolescent at the teen age.

100
00:08:25.900 --> 00:08:32.030
The age of a teen, you know what I'm saying? So that's why
we say, "teenage daughters", which implies that between 13

101
00:08:32.030 --> 00:08:36.970
and 19, you get the idea. Alright, let's move on. Next is "I
just got home from work."

102
00:08:37.890 --> 00:08:42.100
Woman:
"I've got two teenage daughters and I just got home from
work."

103
00:08:43.540 --> 00:08:49.400
Tony Kaizen:
This is the most common way of saying that you have just
arrived at home after your time at work. So somebody says,

104
00:08:49.400 --> 00:08:56.100
"I just got home." It literally means, "I recently arrived
at home." It's just a much more natural, informal way of

105
00:08:56.100 --> 00:09:01.680
saying the same thing. Alright, "next is kicked a hole in
the door".

106
00:09:03.260 --> 00:09:07.380
Woman:
"They were, um, physically fighting with each other and one
of them kicked a hole in the door."

107
00:09:08.420 --> 00:09:13.150
Tony Kaizen:
"One of them kicked the hole in the door". And this
literally means to kick the door so hard that you leave a

108
00:09:13.150 --> 00:09:14.910
hole in the door.

109
00:09:15.090 --> 00:09:23.440
You know? So one might also kick a hole in a wall or um, I
guess those are the most common - kick a hole in the wall,

110
00:09:23.930 --> 00:09:28.420
put a hole in the door. I don't know if you guys have
brothers or cousins, but maybe you're fighting in the house

111
00:09:28.610 --> 00:09:35.340
-- like these two girls -- and things get a little too crazy
and next thing you know, you've got a new hole in the wall.

112
00:09:35.490 --> 00:09:41.500
Anyway, now, you should understand what she meant when she
said they kicked the hole in the door. Let's move on. Next

113
00:09:41.580 --> 00:09:43.500
is "completely out of control".

114
00:09:44.280 --> 00:09:52.050
Woman:
"And, um, they're 12 and almost 14. And the 12-year-old is
completely out of control. And I...I can't...physically, if

115
00:09:52.050 --> 00:09:53.730
she's as big as I am, I can't control her."

116
00:09:54.970 --> 00:09:59.610
Tony Kaizen:
"The 12-year-old is completely out of control." And if
somebody is "completely out of control", it means they're

117
00:09:59.650 --> 00:10:06.990
acting wild and crazy and no one can control or subdue them.
Right? They're just, I mean, it's chaos like wild animals,

118
00:10:07.240 --> 00:10:11.840
right? So next is "she's as big as I am".

119
00:10:12.940 --> 00:10:15.870
Woman:
"I can't...physically, if she's as big as I am, I can't
control her."

120
00:10:15.870 --> 00:10:25.490
Tony Kaizen:
And this is a common sentence structure for comparing
things. So it's the verb "to be" plus "as" plus the

121
00:10:25.490 --> 00:10:29.300
"adjective" plus "as" plus "something".

122
00:10:30.160 --> 00:10:35.740
So I don't want to confuse you. That probably makes no sense
just listening to it. So let me give you the example: "The

123
00:10:35.740 --> 00:10:43.090
daughter is as big as the mother." Right?

124
00:10:43.090 --> 00:10:52.240
So we have subject and then the verb "to be" is "as big as",
right? As "adjective" as "something else". "This thing is as

125
00:10:52.240 --> 00:10:59.280
big as that thing." So another way of saying that is the
daughter is the same size as the mother. That is another way

126
00:10:59.280 --> 00:11:06.500
of saying the same thing. But this sentence structure is
super common, like, "I make as much money as you" or "I am

127
00:11:06.550 --> 00:11:13.860
as tall as you." "My city is as cold as yours." It's a very,
very, very common sentence structure for saying that two

128
00:11:13.860 --> 00:11:19.510
things are equal in quality. You know? Hopefully that makes
sense. But again, any questions you got, leave them on the

129
00:11:19.510 --> 00:11:24.440
Discord server. So next on the list is "Did you want us to
come over and shoot her?"

130
00:11:24.440 --> 00:11:28.690
Woman:
"Physically, if she's as big as I am, I can't control her."

131
00:11:29.400 --> 00:11:31.250
Mike Forbes (911 dispatcher):
"Okay. Did you want us to come over and shoot her?"

132
00:11:33.580 --> 00:11:40.070
Tony Kaizen:
Now, remember that the mother said, "I need someone over
here." So the dispatcher then asked, "Do you want us to come

133
00:11:40.160 --> 00:11:45.050
over?" So you see how they're naturally implying the
distance between them? This is something unconscious. It's

134
00:11:45.080 --> 00:11:51.280
not something we think about. She says, I need someone over
here implying that they need to travel across some distance

135
00:11:51.640 --> 00:11:57.150
to reach our house. And then he says, "Do you want us to
come over?" Because he knows he's going to have to travel a

136
00:11:57.150 --> 00:12:03.800
considerable distance to reach her house. So, the reason I'm
saying that again is just to kind of reiterate the idea. So

137
00:12:03.800 --> 00:12:08.520
hopefully it becomes more clear and you start to get the
idea the more you listen to people speak this way. Alright?

138
00:12:08.910 --> 00:12:14.360
So when he says, "Did you want us to come over and shoot
her?", he literally means take out his gun, squeeze the

139
00:12:14.360 --> 00:12:21.170
trigger, and put a bullet in her daughter. That's what it
means to shoot someone. And of course, it was a joke. So

140
00:12:21.220 --> 00:12:23.440
next on the list is, "Are you there?"

141
00:12:25.260 --> 00:12:31.020
Mike Forbes (911 dispatcher):
"Okay. Did you want us to come over and shoot her? Are you
there?"

142
00:12:31.020 --> 00:12:37.020
Tony Kaizen:
And this is a common way of asking if someone is still
connected to the phone call. Right? And we typically say

143
00:12:37.020 --> 00:12:43.240
this when the call goes silent and it's not clear if the
person is still present. It's like, "Hello, are you there?

144
00:12:43.630 --> 00:12:50.380
Can you hear me? Are you there? Hello?" It's a very, very
common way of asking that question. Alright. Next is "excuse

145
00:12:50.380 --> 00:12:55.880
me". And this is a common and polite way of asking someone
to repeat themselves, but if you pay attention to the tone

146
00:12:55.880 --> 00:12:59.450
of her voice, you might hear that she's communicating her
disbelief.

147
00:13:01.220 --> 00:13:01.760
Mike Forbes (911 dispatcher):
"Are you there?"

148
00:13:02.410 --> 00:13:02.820
Woman:
"Excuse me?"

149
00:13:03.030 --> 00:13:03.820
Mike Forbes (911 dispatcher):
"Uh, that's a joke."

150
00:13:04.690 --> 00:13:10.900
Tony Kaizen:
She's not really saying, "I didn't hear you". She's really
communicating that she can't believe what he really said,

151
00:13:10.900 --> 00:13:16.070
right? Her voice is communicating, like, "Did you really
just say that? Are you serious?" And she said all of these

152
00:13:16.070 --> 00:13:21.480
with two simple words in a particular tone of voice. So I'm
bringing this to your attention because I want to remind you

153
00:13:21.480 --> 00:13:27.410
that you shouldn't just pay attention to what people say.
You should also pay attention to how they say it. And this

154
00:13:27.410 --> 00:13:33.220
will help you understand what somebody really means to say.
It's a communication skill that has nothing to do with

155
00:13:33.220 --> 00:13:38.420
language. And once you master it, understanding natives
becomes much easier, even when you don't understand every

156
00:13:38.420 --> 00:13:44.790
single word of the conversation. But hopefully now, you
understand every word of this hilarious conversation between

157
00:13:44.790 --> 00:13:50.180
a mother and a 911 dispatcher. So that's it for now, my
friends. I hope you enjoyed this episode of The Life in

158
00:13:50.180 --> 00:13:55.920
English podcast. Thank you so much for your time and your
attention. My name is Tony Kaizen, and I'll talk to you

159
00:13:55.920 --> 00:13:57.180
soon. Peace!

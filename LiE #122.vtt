00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:49.660
Once upon a time, there was a Chinese farmer who lost a horse. It ran away.

13
00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:54.140
And all the neighbors came around that evening and said, "Oh, that's too bad".

14
00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:56.700
And the farmer said, "Maybe".

15
00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:01.030
The next day, the horse came back and brought seven wild horses with it,

16
00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:04.830
And all the neighbors came around and said, "Well, that's great, isn't it?".

17
00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:06.950
And the farmer said, "Maybe".

18
00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:11.790
The next day, his son, who was attempting to tame one of the horses,

19
00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:14.840
Was riding it and he was thrown from the horse and broke his leg.

20
00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:19.600
And all the neighbors came around that evening and said, "Well, that's too bad, isn't it?".

21
00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:21.850
And the farmer said, "Maybe".

22
00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:29.650
The next day, the military officers came around looking for people to join the army, and they rejected his son because he had a broken leg.

23
00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:33.860
So all the neighbors came around that evening and said, "Isn't that wonderful?"

24
00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:35.610
And the farmer said, "Maybe".

25
00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:40.990
The whole process of nature is an integrated process of immense complexity.

26
00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:45.860
It really is impossible to tell whether anything that happens in it is good or bad,

27
00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:48.730
Because you never know what the consequences of a misfortune will be.

28
00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:52.050
And you never know what the consequences of good fortune will be.

29
00:01:53.760 --> 00:02:02.680
One door closes, another one opens. You're up today and you're down tomorrow. It was all good just a week ago.

30
00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:08.450
It was fascinating how one simple decision can spark an unpredictable chain of events,

31
00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:12.570
That range from good to bad or from wonderful to horrific.

32
00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:18.090
For example, a kid grows up in a violent and unpredictable environment.

33
00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:24.560
His parents are abusive drug addicts that give him no love, attention, or guidance in his life as he grows up.

34
00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:32.430
He comes to know despair, pain, sorrow, loneliness, and rage at a very young age,

35
00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:37.090
But even still, he doesn't let his upbringing define him or his future.

36
00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:42.360
He finds a way to teach, take care of and rely on himself so that he doesn't end up like his parents.

37
00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:47.240
After years of getting beat by his parents and witnessing the effects of drug addiction,

38
00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:51.570
He decides that he wants to break the cycle of damaged parents raising damaged children.

39
00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:56.880
So he decides to become a child psychologist and he does social work at local schools and churches.

40
00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:01.470
And now he's a positive influence and a father figure for countless kids in his community,

41
00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:05.160
Keeping them out of trouble and thus saving countless lives in the process.

42
00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:09.840
He's helping kids to understand that even if you can't change your environment at the moment,

43
00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:12.960
You can always choose how you react to your environment.

44
00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:19.470
So was this man growing up in an abusive, toxic environment, a good thing or a bad thing?

45
00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:26.430
A new social media website allows people to reconnect with long-lost friends and family members,

46
00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:30.280
But it also plays a part in the increase of teenage suicide.

47
00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:37.090
It allows creative and ambitious people to start their own businesses and reach millions of people almost instantly.

48
00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:44.050
But the owners of the platform also bend and censor certain individuals simply because they have opposing political views,

49
00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:46.450
And their following is getting a little too big.

50
00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:51.450
Social media allows us to spread and share information faster than ever before.

51
00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:56.500
People have access to knowledge and wisdom that they wouldn't have if not for social media.

52
00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:01.570
But they're also exposed to more lives and manufactured information than ever before.

53
00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:10.320
So was the invention of social media a good thing or a bad thing?

54
00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:18.100
In 1998, in a small town in India, a man was tired of seeing his wife's struggle with the inconveniences of the female menstrual cycle.

55
00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:25.220
His wife was collecting filthy rags and newspapers to use as sanitary pads while she was on her period

56
00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:28.890
Because the pads that were made by multinational corporations were just too expensive.

57
00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:35.090
So he decided to start experimenting to see if he could create a more cost-effective option for the women in this country.

58
00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:41.080
He tried different materials, sizes, and chemicals, but his wife and sisters didn't like any of them.

59
00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:48.270
He becomes so obsessed with this idea that his wife and sisters eventually refuse to be test subjects for his project.

60
00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:54.460
So he looked for other women to test his invention, but they weren't even open to talking about their menstrual cycles with him

61
00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:57.700
As they were kind of shy and it was like a taboo topic at the time.

62
00:04:57.700 --> 00:05:02.900
But instead of giving up, he started testing the sanitary pads on himself.

63
00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:10.610
This man would fill a bladder with animal blood to simulate a woman menstruating just so he could test his invention.

64
00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:17.250
And this quickly made him the laughing stock of the village and his family and friends thought he was fucking crazy and they began to ostracize him.

65
00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:21.630
He started giving his products to girls at the local medical college for free

66
00:05:21.950 --> 00:05:25.650
Just to get some feedback from the people who would actually use the product.

67
00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:33.120
It took him over two years to finally find the right materials and invent a low-cost machine

68
00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:38.110
That could produce the sanitary pads the right way at a price that women in India could afford.

69
00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:45.150
Eventually, he went on to have his invention recognized nationally and even got financial investments to scale his company.

70
00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:51.070
And now he's praised as a man who played a major role in changing women's lives forever in India.

71
00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:56.560
The pad-making machine that he invented also creates jobs and income for many women,

72
00:05:56.850 --> 00:06:02.160
And the affordable pads enable a lot more women to continue working and making money while they're on their period.

73
00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:09.190
So this man has undoubtedly inspired people all over his country to do great things like start businesses,

74
00:06:09.550 --> 00:06:12.010
Create solutions to other social issues in their country.

75
00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:17.740
Stay dedicated to your purpose and to never give up just because it gets difficult or people think you're crazy.

76
00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:25.110
There's no way that we can measure how much of a positive impact this man has had on his country and his people.

77
00:06:26.270 --> 00:06:35.460
So, was this man's decision to create a more cost-effective sanitary pad for his wife and sisters a good one or a bad one?

78
00:06:38.100 --> 00:06:40.660
It's our perspective that determines whether something is good or bad,

79
00:06:41.020 --> 00:06:46.670
And our perspective can change over time, which in turn can change how we look at a situation over time.

80
00:06:46.750 --> 00:06:50.660
What's good today, could be bad next year.

81
00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:59.410
But the reality is that things are neither good nor bad. They just are.

00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:07.220
What is going on, my friend? This is Kaizen after Dark. I am
your host, Tony Kaizen. And forgive me if you hear cars

2
00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:14.220
passing by or sirens and shit like that. I'm at the park
right now recording this podcast episode and, uh, I wanted

3
00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:18.570
to just leave you with something to think about or I really
want to get your opinion. So after you hear this episode,

4
00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:25.500
please hit me up on Discord so we can talk about it because
there's a lot of harmful information out there being spread

5
00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:31.210
on the Internet and especially harmful to young people
because there are a lot of young people who just don't have

6
00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:38.170
much life experience and they also don't really have any
role models or, you know, father or mother figures to guide

7
00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:42.790
them through life so they're just being parented by their
cell phones. Whatever they see on the screen and hear...is

8
00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:48.750
what they got. That's their guide through life, you know
what I'm saying? So there's a lot of harmful information out

9
00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:54.720
there, um, in relation to young people, for lack of a better
way of saying it. But out of all the harmful information,

10
00:00:55.580 --> 00:01:04.760
some of the information that I think is most harmful is the
idea that one can just chase their dreams and everything

11
00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:09.820
will be fine. You know, you'll hear people say, follow your
dreams, follow your passions, you know, do what you love and

12
00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:15.100
you'll never work a day in your life. You just have to find
what you love and try to do that for a living. And although

13
00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:22.720
that sounds amazing and there are some people who actually
achieve that, I don't think that...that idea is complete, to

14
00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:28.040
say that you can just, you know, decide what you love to do
more than anything else and try to make a career out of

15
00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:34.750
that. It's not necessarily...it's not the whole truth, let's
say. There's a lot more that goes into that. I think the

16
00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:42.360
complete idea is, but -- alright, you can follow your
dreams, but -- you're going to have to learn a lot along the

17
00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:48.150
way and most likely do a lot of shit that you don't want to
do. Because at the end of the day, what it took me years to

18
00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:54.960
understand and then accept is that you can... you can follow
your passions, bro. You can follow your dreams, you can

19
00:01:54.960 --> 00:02:02.240
invest in what you love, whether it's art or fucking
agriculture or whatever, whatever, you know, construction,

20
00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:07.470
building furniture, whatever it is that tickles your fancy.
You can invest in those skills, you can invest in those

21
00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:14.050
crafts. But unless you can get somebody to pay you for them,
you will never make a living doing that shit, bro. Now,

22
00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:18.950
thankfully, there are many ways to monetize your passions
these days, but the point is you still have to learn that

23
00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:24.930
stuff. And especially if we're talking about creative work,
to say that you can just put out creative work and people

24
00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:29.440
are naturally going to love it and share it and you'll
become a fucking millionaire if you just stick with it.

25
00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:35.430
That's fucking nonsense, bro. It's nonsense because if when
money gets involved, it's no longer just art, it's business

26
00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:41.910
now. You're talking about working for yourself, monetizing
your passions. You're talking about being a solopreneur,

27
00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:47.960
which is like, I don't know if it's slang, but it's a term
we use for somebody who is doing entrepreneurial things, but

28
00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:52.980
not necessarily running a business, because a business
technically doesn't require you to be there for it to

29
00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:59.210
operate. But if you're like, uh, a sole proprietor and
you're just working for yourself, you're like a solopreneur.

30
00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:05.860
That's the idea. So if you're going to be a solopreneur or
an entrepreneur or whatever you want to call it, you have to

31
00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:12.430
learn how business works, bro. You have to learn about
marketing. More...More importantly than anything, or I

32
00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:18.980
should say, what's more important than anything is learning
about marketing, how to sell yourself and what you do and

33
00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:24.660
understanding what selling even is. A lot of people don't
even know what selling actually is, you know, and the

34
00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:31.320
branding and finance and budgeting and investing and fucking
hiring people and creating systems and automating those

35
00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:38.110
systems so that you can just focus on what it is you love
while the business part is not on autopilot, but it runs

36
00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:44.460
without your constant attention. You see what I'm saying? 
There's so many little things that you have to learn when it

37
00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:49.450
comes to making money for yourself, especially in the
creative world, because a lot of people think, "Oh, I can

38
00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:56.460
just make a Tik Tok profile, a YouTube channel, or start a
podcast, and I just put the content out there and the rest

39
00:03:56.460 --> 00:04:04.320
takes care of itself." This is false. This, I can tell you
from experience, my friend, this is not true. You have to

40
00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:10.210
learn the other side of it, how money is actually made. So I
think a much better thing to tell young people -- really,

41
00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:16.570
anybody in general who wants to work for themselves or
monetize their passions -- is you first have to understand

42
00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:23.610
what the market values, you understand? If we're talking
about business and money being exchanged for services or

43
00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:29.610
products or whatever, you have to understand what people are
willing to pay for. You have to understand why somebody

44
00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:35.860
would remove their wallet from their pocket, pull out their
credit card and give you the number so that you can charge

45
00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:41.590
them. You have to understand what makes people do that. You
see what I'm saying? And that doesn't... I don't think

46
00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:49.380
that's like obvious information to an artist who wants to
make money from their artwork. You see what I'm saying? It

47
00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:55.820
wasn't obvious to me, you know, and a lot of us, even if we
understand the idea that it's not as easy as it looks, I

48
00:04:55.820 --> 00:05:02.020
think a lot of people, especially young people, see these
people online who make it look easy or these people online

49
00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:07.420
who know how to talk a good game or these people online who
try to make it look easy so they can sell you the tools you

50
00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:13.960
need to get it done. And they just get this false
impression. They...They get this distorted vision of the way

51
00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:23.080
things work and how much fucking effort and time and energy
and diligence and discipline and patience go into creating

52
00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:31.480
the life of your dreams. Walking the road less traveled, you
know what I'm saying? I think I talked about this in the

53
00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:36.420
previous episode. I don't remember what number it was, but
just advice for young creatives is what I was talking about.

54
00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:43.050
And it's exactly that. You have to understand you are
choosing to go against the grain. You are choosing to do

55
00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:47.750
what most people are afraid to do or simply don't want to
do. Not everyone's afraid to do it. Some people are happy

56
00:05:47.750 --> 00:05:54.710
being employees or just having their hobbies and side
passions for the weekend. I'm not one of those people. And

57
00:05:54.710 --> 00:06:00.440
everyone's different. I guess that's my point. But, I don't
know, man. It's just really, really, really important to

58
00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:06.970
understand. You can follow your dreams. You can try to
realize the life of your dream and everything. But, man,

59
00:06:06.970 --> 00:06:15.640
just do not underestimate how much...education and
experience goes into that process.

60
00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:21.380
You know what I'm saying? It's super important. It's super
important. So getting back to what I was saying, I don't

61
00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:26.550
know if I made my point completely, but the first thing that
I would suggest is that you figure out what the market

62
00:06:26.550 --> 00:06:33.620
values. Because if people don't value the thing, they're not
gonna pay for the thing, right? Because you might just... by

63
00:06:33.620 --> 00:06:40.060
doing...by going through this process of figuring out what
it is that the market values, you can then decide, "Is what

64
00:06:40.060 --> 00:06:47.010
I want to do for a living something that the market values?"
Because if it's not, guess what? You're making no fucking

65
00:06:47.010 --> 00:06:50.490
money, my friend. Just facts, you know?

66
00:06:51.890 --> 00:06:58.590
Maybe you want to produce a particular type of movie or make
a particular type of music or start this particular type of

67
00:06:58.590 --> 00:07:05.340
project. If nobody gives a shit, if people don't receive
some kind of value from it, I mean serious value from it

68
00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:11.970
that they couldn't get anywhere else, why would they pay you
for it? You know what I'm saying? Nobody cares how much you

69
00:07:11.970 --> 00:07:16.570
love your fucking work if it doesn't do them any
good...nobody...they don't give a shit. They don't care,

70
00:07:16.570 --> 00:07:21.980
people don't care about you or your passion or your dreams.
Nobody gives a shit. Not your mother, your father, your

71
00:07:21.980 --> 00:07:30.620
girlfriend, boyfriend, your cousins, your siblings. Nobody
cares, bro. Nobody cares. Let me say it again. Nobody cares.

72
00:07:32.140 --> 00:07:37.760
So before you put yourself through a bunch of frustration
and heartache and confusion and all these...these negative

73
00:07:37.760 --> 00:07:44.040
feelings that you will inevitably experience at some point,
but to limit those feelings, you really got to get your head

74
00:07:44.040 --> 00:07:50.350
on straight and understand the game that you are playing.
One does not simply follow one's dreams without educating

75
00:07:50.350 --> 00:07:56.310
oneself, without running into barriers, without solving
one's own problems, becoming a resourceful person, learning

76
00:07:56.310 --> 00:08:02.770
how to learn, and then being disciplined enough and humble
enough to keep going every time you hit a wall, fucking

77
00:08:03.050 --> 00:08:09.210
blast through that shit. If nobody wants to help you,
fucking help yourself, bro. And I just don't think this is

78
00:08:09.210 --> 00:08:15.570
stuff that people are telling young folks nowadays. So they
naively try to, you know, become fucking famous and

79
00:08:15.570 --> 00:08:22.060
influencers and just want views and subscribers and clout
and recognition and all this fucking nonsense as opposed to

80
00:08:22.060 --> 00:08:29.080
investing in real skills that the market values enough to
pay for. That is how you live the life of your dreams. By

81
00:08:29.080 --> 00:08:36.010
waking up and accepting reality and understanding, yes, you
can realize the life of your dreams, but, large amounts of

82
00:08:36.110 --> 00:08:43.820
pleasure and fun and excitement must be matched with
discipline, with perseverance, with education, you

83
00:08:43.820 --> 00:08:48.700
understand? I didn't write all this down. I'm kind of
freestyling, so hopefully I'm getting my point across to

84
00:08:48.700 --> 00:08:56.850
you. But it's --man, it's been on my mind a lot lately, it's--
you can't make progress, you can't evolve, you can't grow if

85
00:08:56.850 --> 00:09:03.320
you're not like actively trying to educate yourself, gain
experience, learn new things, try new things, you know what

86
00:09:03.320 --> 00:09:10.760
I'm saying? It's...it's just... it's not gonna work. It's
not gonna work. So, I think by going through that process of

87
00:09:10.760 --> 00:09:16.220
trying and failing and getting feedback, you slowly start to
understand what do people find valuable? How much are people

88
00:09:16.220 --> 00:09:22.780
willing to pay for certain things? What do people pay the
most for, you know? Is what I'm trying to sell easily found

89
00:09:22.780 --> 00:09:27.840
in other places? Can people get it for free? You know what I
mean? Am I actually providing value to other people or just

90
00:09:27.840 --> 00:09:36.060
to myself? Am I actually thinking about my customer? Or am I
just thinking about myself? I could talk for hours about

91
00:09:36.060 --> 00:09:40.260
this man. I probably should have wrote all this down
beforehand to really, really, really drive my point home.

92
00:09:40.710 --> 00:09:47.820
But, man, I could make 300 more episodes just about this
subject. I really think it's something that we should all

93
00:09:47.820 --> 00:09:53.360
talk about a little bit more and we should definitely be
telling our young people because, man, if we don't raise our

94
00:09:53.360 --> 00:10:03.130
kids to think properly, to attack their objectives and
achieve their goals in the proper way, we're setting

95
00:10:03.130 --> 00:10:10.850
everyone up for failure because kids are the future, you
know? So teaching them how to productively realize the ideas

96
00:10:10.850 --> 00:10:18.090
and the visions and the dreams they have in their mind is
better for everyone. You see what I'm saying? I just imagine

97
00:10:18.090 --> 00:10:24.850
what the world would be like if some of the greatest
inventors or businesspeople or even employees didn't have

98
00:10:24.850 --> 00:10:30.420
the right mentality and they were just delusional about the
value they were offering, delusional about how much money

99
00:10:30.420 --> 00:10:36.700
they could make, delusional about who they were doing things
for. Just didn't understand business or the value exchange,

100
00:10:36.700 --> 00:10:41.410
didn't care about their customers, never tried to evolve or
improve what they were doing. Just imagine where we would

101
00:10:41.410 --> 00:10:41.610
be.

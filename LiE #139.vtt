00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:01.960
Tony Kaizen:
All right, Kairo. So the first question, how old are you?

2
00:00:02.690 --> 00:00:03.250
Kairo Omar:
I'm 19.

3
00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:08.410
Tony Kaizen:
19. Okay. So this going to be interesting for you. Our
question is, if you had to give some advice to your younger

4
00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:13.440
self, maybe go back four or five, six years, maybe when you
were just starting high school or something like that, what

5
00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:17.350
advice would you give to yourself? What would you say
directly to the younger version of yourself?

6
00:00:18.190 --> 00:00:24.090
Kairo Omar:
Well, you could do anything like on some real shh...can,
can, can I? On some real shit, my nigga! Yo, you can do

7
00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:28.910
anything, bro. It's like I remember going through high
school. It's like I was blessed that I had people that was

8
00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:31.630
like, ooh, shit, I see it's starting to rain. I was blessed
to have people that were trying to look out for me. And

9
00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:35.930
that's not something everybody really gets all the time, you
know? And so it's like dang! I go to Morehouse, so you know

10
00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:39.380
what I'm saying so it was like, I'm from, I'm from New York.
I'm, I'm from Jersey, you know what I'm saying, so making

11
00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:43.430
that transition down here and just looking at what I've been
able to accomplish so far and, you know, and then just

12
00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:47.270
looking at what I want to accomplish for the rest of my
life. You do anything bro, you know what I'm saying? So you

13
00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:51.160
just lock in with it bro, believe in yourself, you know,
because at the end of the day, the only person who knows you

14
00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:55.060
better than you is you; the only person who knows you for
real is you, you know? So just like locking in with your

15
00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:56.160
shit through. So yeah.

16
00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:01.510
Tony Kaizen:
Hundred percent, bro! Now, back when you were around that
age, 14, 15, did you have a different belief like, did you

17
00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:04.590
have those self-limiting beliefs or doubts about the stuff
you could do?

18
00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:08.670
Kairo Omar:
Oh yeah, of course. Of course. You know what I'm saying,
because I feel like, especially at that age, we're all so

19
00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:13.860
malleable and especially with social media, too, it's just
like...I feel like...I feel like especially like my

20
00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:18.390
generation of people, our generation of people coming up,
you know what I'm saying it's like we're really quick to be

21
00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:23.600
influenced and really quick to be, I guess, impacted by what
other people are saying, or at least like, what like, what

22
00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:27.990
we are seeing. You know, if I wasn't living up to a certain
standard, if I wasn't moving in a certain way, I might have

23
00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:31.890
thought... I might have been failing myself. I might have
been failing my family, man, or at least failing the people

24
00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:35.910
around me, you know what I'm saying? But now it's like, like
as I've gotten older, as I've gotten wiser, everything's

25
00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:40.050
coming to understand that it's like, it's all relative, you
know what I'm saying? It's like...It's like...It's like,

26
00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:43.560
it's like the grind that you might be on is different from
the grind that I might be on. It's a different grind that

27
00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:46.810
this brother might be on behind the camera. You know what
I'm saying, it's like, we are all different. So it's like,

28
00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:50.440
you got to trust yourself. You just got to be willing
to...to yeah, to just trust yourself for real.

29
00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:55.720
Tony Kaizen:
When was it that you noticed that, that, because I agree
100%, especially with the Internet today, bro, you can do

30
00:01:56.030 --> 00:02:00.510
literally anything. But how old were you when you realized
that? Or can you remember the moment when it kind of clicked

31
00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:00.740
for you?

32
00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:05.180
Kairo Omar:
I mean, it's been clicking since I got really gotten to
college for real, you know what I'm saying? Because I feel

33
00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:09.940
like, I feel like...being in high school,
definitely...definitely over quarantine as well, you know?

34
00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:13.390
But it's like...I'm like...being in high school. It's just
like, being like, in like that little bubble, you know what

35
00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:17.330
I'm saying? It's like I got so used to having social media
there, but I also knew everybody else so I really wasn't

36
00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:21.740
looking at it too often. But then, you know, coming out of
COVID and starting to like make my transition down here to

37
00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:27.230
go to college and shit...oh it's crazy, bro! I remember it,
it's like, it's like it's like interacting with people in

38
00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:30.880
person versus on social media. It just felt different, you
know what I'm saying? But then again, I wasn't the real

39
00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:35.500
person. That was just my perception of them. Just I had
garnered over the phone for the past like two or three

40
00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:41.170
months, you know. So, so yeah, it's definitely that was
definitely over quarantine. Definitely making my shift into

41
00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:46.320
college is definitely one that happened, you know, but, but,
you know, like, like word, too, bro? Like all this shit is,

42
00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:50.610
it's social media ain't a real thing, like on some real
shit, like, like, like you feel me? So...word!

43
00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:56.400
Tony Kaizen:
Yeah, hundred percent, hundred percent! So basically, the
advice to your younger self is just remember you can do

44
00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:58.340
whatever you want, literally anything.

45
00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:03.710
Kairo Omar:
Exactly. And then, then, right, cause if you're on the topic
of the Internet, bro, it's like literally, it's like, like

46
00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:07.850
the same way...the same way how you have a YouTube channel,
you have to get your message out there. You all know,

47
00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:10.980
whatever the message is, you know, saying whatever it is,
yo, yo, make sure to subscribe to these dudes!

48
00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:12.300
Tony Kaizen:
Subscribe! Goddammit!

49
00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:16.480
Kairo Omar:
Make sure to subscribe! Yeah, now you know what I'm saying,
but it's like, but like on some real shit, it's just like

50
00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:19.560
even with the internet, it's like, you can do anything that
you want these days on the internet. You know what I'm

51
00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:23.440
saying? It's like just looking at how music is transforming
and looking at how social justice is transforming. You know

52
00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:27.630
what I'm saying? Shit looking at how...you know what I'm
saying? Just looking at how how you spend your day, you know

53
00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:31.100
what I'm saying? What you decide to do with yourself, how
fashion trends are changing...you know what I'm saying? Over

54
00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:36.700
time, it's like what we as a society, what we, what we as a
society, what, what we're beginning to value is being shaped

55
00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:42.440
so much by the internet. So it's one of the biggest rules
out there right now. So most definitely you can do anything

56
00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:45.860
that you want to for real. I'm saying as long as you have
the right platform, as long as you know how to finesse the

57
00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:48.750
internet properly, you can make anything shape for yourself
for real.

58
00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:53.230
Tony Kaizen:
Man, that was beautifully said. Appreciate that! Remember
that one. So what is it that you want to do at this point?

59
00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:56.390
You're 19 now and you understand you can do anything. So
where are you trying to get?

60
00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:02.520
Kairo Omar:
Bro! I was literally talking to my girl about this shit. We
just got out the aquarium. Like, bro, like Met Gala, bro

61
00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:05.800
like that, you know what I'm saying? 'Cause I wanna do music
and all that shit. Like, I'm really just starting to get

62
00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:10.640
myself out there and shit, you know? And so, like, for me,
just, like, putting myself onto that process, it definitely

63
00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:13.840
feels weird, you know, because something I never really,
especially at high school, I was thinking myself, I'm never

64
00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:18.110
gonna do that shit, never going to do music, you know, like
being in college. And I've gotten more comfortable with,

65
00:04:18.110 --> 00:04:23.570
like po...with doing poetry and shit, and so getting myself
involved in that aspect. Yeah, it's like right now, right

66
00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:26.460
now Met Gala is the goal, fuck the Grammy, fuck whatever,
all that other shit. You know what I'm saying? Like right

67
00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:30.190
now it really is Met Gala because you know ain't Grammy's
some bullshit, all that shit...all these shit some bullshit.

68
00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:35.090
You know, all these Met Galas, like, that's more like the
people who know really know that's supposed to be there. You

69
00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:38.490
know what I'm saying? It's more, it's more about who's
shifting the culture, who matters in the culture, you know,

70
00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:42.750
and you know, I'm saying...I'm...I'm on my...what's the
matter on the culture on some real shit. So Met Gala for

71
00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:43.610
sure, that's the goal right now.

72
00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:44.920
Tony Kaizen:
What's that? Met gala? How do you spell that?

73
00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:50.270
Kairo Omar:
Met Gala. M-e-t. You know, it's ah...it's up in New York,
the Metro Metropolitan Museum or something like that. Right?

74
00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:52.300
But it's the M-e-t Gala.

75
00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:55.210
Tony Kaizen:
Oh, like Metropolitan Gallery or something like that.

76
00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:58.990
Kairo Omar:
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. So the Met gala, basically. So it's
like, it's like, you'll have, like, you know who Anna

77
00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:03.630
Wintour is? Yeah. Right. So it's like, she'll probably,
like, run it, type of shit. And so it's like, it'll be like,

78
00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:08.550
every year you'll see like, niggas like Frank Ocean pop out,
just like Rihanna, Drake, all these niggas, like, you know

79
00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:12.300
what I'm saying? Virgil Abloh, you know what I'm saying?
It's like, RIP, RIP Virgil, RIP Virgil, you know what I'm

80
00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:17.510
saying? But it's just like they all pop bottles and shit,
but it's like, like you, you feel like kinda who is going

81
00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:20.710
there...these are people who are influencing the culture.
These people, these are people who have, you know what I'm

82
00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:26.040
saying, who have some standard of celebrity, you know, and
that obviously the goal isn't to get famous. The goal is to

83
00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:29.530
make a shift of a culture, you know what I'm saying? The
goal is to make...it's to leave a lasting imprint, you know

84
00:05:29.530 --> 00:05:33.750
what I'm saying, on whatever I'm trying to do in my life,
you know, with some real shit. So that's that's the goal.

85
00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:38.570
Met Gala for sure. I feel like there...cos it's not only,
not only are you there, not only...cos the only way you get

86
00:05:38.570 --> 00:05:43.350
invited is by niggas knowing that you're doing some shit.
You feel me? And you know what I'm saying? That's the you,

87
00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:47.320
you, you...This is good music, by the way. I hear the jazz
music, you know what I'm saying? But we all want our peers

88
00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:51.300
to be able to, to call you out on your shit, you know. So
that's the goal for sure.

89
00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:55.010
Tony Kaizen:
So are you already putting stuff online? Do you have a
channel or somewhere that people can follow you?

90
00:05:55.320 --> 00:06:04.150
Kairo Omar:
I got a regular Instagram for right now. It's K...It's Kairo
dot Omar. K-a-i-r-o dot Omar, O-m-a-r.

91
00:06:04.730 --> 00:06:09.060
As for music, I'm still trying to figure that out right now.
That's what, that's what the summer is for. Just gonna lock

92
00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:11.340
in with that. So, yeah, you're gonna see what happens,
hopefully.

93
00:06:11.510 --> 00:06:13.060
Tony Kaizen:
Follow that man on Instagram, alright?

94
00:06:13.250 --> 00:06:15.380
Kairo Omar:
Appreciate you! And make sure to subscribe to these dudes as
well bro!

95
00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:18.810
Tony Kaizen:
Subscribe, goddammit! I dig it, bro.

96
00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:24.050
Alright. So next question. This question, this one, maybe
you do, maybe you don't have an answer, but can you think of

97
00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:29.260
your worst injury that you've ever had? And this could be
physical or even mental, emotional, or something like that.

98
00:06:29.570 --> 00:06:30.830
Talk about your worst injury.

99
00:06:31.110 --> 00:06:36.960
Kairo Omar:
My worst injury? Ah...I'm not gonna lie. I guess, I'm going
to...Imma get some of this focus more like the mental tip,

100
00:06:37.030 --> 00:06:40.620
you know what I'm saying? Because everybody, everybody gets
injured, you know, like, in like a physical sense, you know

101
00:06:40.620 --> 00:06:44.660
what I'm saying? But it's like anything can affect you.
Anything can impact you. But I feel like how it impacts you

102
00:06:44.660 --> 00:06:49.880
really does, does matter more on your mind, on some real
shit, you know? So it's like for me, again, it was tough to

103
00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:53.420
come out of the quarantine and having to make that
adjustment, you know, because like in high school, I was mad

104
00:06:53.420 --> 00:06:57.660
social. Like now, like I'm back to that point in my life
again where I can feel open and shit. But you know what I'm

105
00:06:57.660 --> 00:07:02.030
saying, but as I come out of high school being so used to
being so social with, with a very specific group of people,

106
00:07:02.740 --> 00:07:06.600
that I don't see them niggas for like, for like a fucking
year, some change, And I go to college, brand new

107
00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:11.860
motherfucker. So I got to get used to, you know. So I guess
it wasn't even like a wound. It was just more of like, it

108
00:07:11.860 --> 00:07:16.430
was...I had to...I had to learn to become more flexible, you
know what I'm saying? So it's like, I ain't, I ain't, I

109
00:07:16.430 --> 00:07:20.180
ain't break. I just bent a little bit, you know what I'm
saying? But you know what I'm saying. But what...but it's

110
00:07:20.200 --> 00:07:21.930
like we're supposed to bend, you know, like, go through some
shit, right?

111
00:07:21.930 --> 00:07:24.350
Tony Kaizen:
Hundred percent. Hundred percent. Pressure makes diamonds,
you know what I'm saying?

112
00:07:24.350 --> 00:07:24.670
Kairo Omar:
Word, too?

113
00:07:25.540 --> 00:07:27.920
Tony Kaizen:
I can dig that. Now, have you noticed...is this your first
time in Atlanta?

114
00:07:28.480 --> 00:07:32.910
Kairo Omar:
No, I've been out here for like a year, and I'm a, I'm gonna
be a junior next semester. It's like a year and a half now.

115
00:07:33.180 --> 00:07:35.820
Tony Kaizen:
Okay. So you've been out here for a little bit, but you grew
up in New York?

116
00:07:36.320 --> 00:07:37.500
Kairo Omar:
In New York, New Jersey, yeah.

117
00:07:37.700 --> 00:07:43.160
Tony Kaizen:
Okay. Okay. So what are some differences you noticed in the
way we interact, the way we talk, the culture? I ain't even

118
00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:47.700
gotta say no more. Talk about the differences between the
culture and the people up in New York and what you notice

119
00:07:47.700 --> 00:07:48.340
down here in Atlanta.

120
00:07:48.530 --> 00:07:54.610
Kairo Omar:
I'll say just the general vibe of Atlanta is so fucking
slow. It's like, a part of me appreciates it for sure, you

121
00:07:54.610 --> 00:07:57.650
know what I'm saying, right? Because it's like, you know
what I'm saying, because it's like I was born in Brooklyn

122
00:07:57.650 --> 00:08:02.560
and I ended up moving out to Teaneck. Shout out to Teaneck,
New Jersey! Yo, yo, what's up, my niggas? Yo! Waddup but

123
00:08:02.560 --> 00:08:07.710
nah...you know what I'm saying it's like...it's like making
that shift though. It's like being being up north...it's a

124
00:08:07.820 --> 00:08:11.370
lot faster. I can get a lot...I can get around to places
easier, down here bro...

125
00:08:12.270 --> 00:08:13.120
Tony Kaizen:
We're just talking about that.

126
00:08:13.120 --> 00:08:16.160
Kairo Omar:
Word! I mean, my fault, are, are y'all, are y'all from down
here or?

127
00:08:16.160 --> 00:08:16.780
Tony Kaizen:
Nah, I'm from California.

128
00:08:16.830 --> 00:08:17.890
Kairo Omar:
From California? What about you?

129
00:08:19.320 --> 00:08:20.450
Marcus (cameraman):
All the way West Coast.

130
00:08:20.450 --> 00:08:23.750
Kairo Omar:
Oh, I gotcha. All right, bet. Yeah, yeah, word. You know
what I'm saying, so it's like, y'all can kind of relate to

131
00:08:23.750 --> 00:08:27.700
this as well. It's like, you know what I'm saying, I'm sure
even being on the West Coast is a little bit slower than up

132
00:08:27.700 --> 00:08:33.370
north, you know what I'm saying? But it's like, but even
slower, making that transition, it's a lot slower. Umm the

133
00:08:33.370 --> 00:08:38.430
food here, I'm not really a big fan of Atlanta, of the food
scene in Atlanta. You know what I'm saying? Only cos I get

134
00:08:38.430 --> 00:08:42.610
like, coming from New York, I know exactly what, what I can
get. I...I've just been so used to it, you know? So I just

135
00:08:42.610 --> 00:08:48.960
have a little bit of bias in that food. But I don't know, I,
I fuck with Atlanta off of...off of the aesthetic tip, you

136
00:08:48.960 --> 00:08:52.990
know, saying there's so much you can do here. And that's
another thing too. It's like Atlanta is one of those cities

137
00:08:52.990 --> 00:08:56.250
in which it's like, really like, real talk, the sky's the
limit. You know what I'm saying? There's so much going on.

138
00:08:56.250 --> 00:09:01.850
You can do so much. And...and it's similar to New York, you
know what I'm saying? But like, like it's smaller, you know,

139
00:09:01.890 --> 00:09:05.930
so it's like, so it's like, you can really go out and find
those opportunities, you know, instead of like walking, you

140
00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:09.960
know what I'm saying? Because like to walk the whole island
of Manhattan, I'm not doing that shit, you know? I...at

141
00:09:09.960 --> 00:09:15.590
least in Atlanta, I can walk around downtown Atlanta I mean
in like an hour. I can find some shit to do, you know?

142
00:09:15.590 --> 00:09:19.350
Tony Kaizen:
I didn't think about that. That's true though. That's true.

143
00:09:19.820 --> 00:09:22.830
Kairo Omar:
Anything like, word to. I remember I got into open mic
nights down here. You know what I'm saying? We're doing

144
00:09:22.830 --> 00:09:24.800
poetry? Yeah, doing poetry and shit like. Yeah.

145
00:09:24.800 --> 00:09:29.370
Tony Kaizen:
Okay. That's what's up, bro. That's what's up. Man, I got to
get to New York, bro.

146
00:09:29.620 --> 00:09:30.330
Kairo Omar:
Nah, nah word to!

147
00:09:30.380 --> 00:09:30.940
Tony Kaizen:
'Cause I got, like..

148
00:09:30.940 --> 00:09:32.030
Kairo Omar:
I gotta get out to Cali, shit!

149
00:09:32.190 --> 00:09:37.820
Tony Kaizen:
Like what I...My impression of New York is, like, you get a
little bit of everything in one city, especially the food. I

150
00:09:37.820 --> 00:09:42.000
mean, you probably got Asian food, Latino food,
Haitian...Jamaican food, all types of...

151
00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:46.520
Kairo Omar:
Yeah, most definitely! Word. And the, the food...The food up
there is always hitting for real. Not to mention, too.

152
00:09:46.800 --> 00:09:52.270
That's one thing about Atlanta that hurts...it hurts my
heart, my nigga, when I tell you this shit, right? Imagine

153
00:09:52.270 --> 00:09:57.880
being hungry at 12. You know what I'm saying? 12 in the
morning. What you gonna get in Atlanta? Not a damn thing.

154
00:09:57.880 --> 00:09:58.110
Hungry.

155
00:09:58.110 --> 00:10:00.440
Tony Kaizen:
Waffle House. That's all you got. Waffle House.

156
00:10:00.510 --> 00:10:04.080
Kairo Omar:
That is true. Right? But.. Right? But I ain't got the...I
ain't got the whip on me, though. You feel me? I'm

157
00:10:04.080 --> 00:10:06.300
so...yeah, word, word!

158
00:10:06.300 --> 00:10:09.130
I get the...I get the UberEats but you know, but that adds
up on some shit.

159
00:10:09.890 --> 00:10:12.500
Tony Kaizen:
That's cash for real. You still in school, too, so no, we
can't.

160
00:10:12.730 --> 00:10:13.880
Kairo Omar:
You can't do that, word.

161
00:10:13.880 --> 00:10:18.340
Tony Kaizen:
Yeah, man, that's my only thing. Like, you can't walk around
downtown, but that's another thing...We was just talking

162
00:10:18.340 --> 00:10:23.640
about that earlier. How, like, this is not necessarily a
walkable city. Like we was thinking like New York, you got

163
00:10:24.130 --> 00:10:29.890
extensive train system, you can get from here to there real
fast. But Atlanta, you got the red line and the blue line.

164
00:10:30.320 --> 00:10:30.860
Other than that...

165
00:10:30.860 --> 00:10:33.570
Kairo Omar:
And you better hope...and you better hope that your stop is
on that shit.

166
00:10:33.690 --> 00:10:37.770
Tony Kaizen:
Exactly...Uber, walking, or hopefully your homie got a car
and that's it.

167
00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:43.120
Kairo Omar:
Yeah. Word to. I remember the first time I took the
Marta...I had to. I was headed to Lenox, right? I was on

168
00:10:43.120 --> 00:10:48.420
that shit for like 45 minutes and sitting on the train, I
was kind of like, why am I...why am I sitting here so damn

169
00:10:48.420 --> 00:10:48.550
low.

170
00:10:48.550 --> 00:10:50.360
Tony Kaizen:
Why haven't I fucking got there yet, bruh!?

171
00:10:50.420 --> 00:10:51.740
Kairo Omar:
Word to! Word.

172
00:10:51.740 --> 00:10:55.680
Right. And again you know what I'm saying, and but again, it
just goes back into like Atlanta being so slow, and

173
00:10:55.680 --> 00:10:59.550
obviously Atlanta was never built for this many people. You
know what I'm saying? You know what I'm saying, so like,

174
00:10:59.550 --> 00:11:04.950
after the Olympics, you see usually the major...you see the
major influx, you know, but even so. But it's like, like, I

175
00:11:05.030 --> 00:11:09.240
feel like that's just part of the magic of Atlanta, though,
you know, because there's so...because there's so many

176
00:11:09.240 --> 00:11:13.310
people. Because there's so much going on. You know what I'm
saying, it's like you see so many people, like, like people

177
00:11:13.310 --> 00:11:17.440
are forced to make a way for themselves in a way down here.
You know what I'm saying? Now meanwhile, like, like in New

178
00:11:17.440 --> 00:11:20.520
York. Yeah, like those places are already there because so
many people. But it's not the same, you know what I'm

179
00:11:20.520 --> 00:11:25.440
saying? It's like the community is there. But I feel like in
New York is a lot harder to get into, you know, down here

180
00:11:25.440 --> 00:11:29.570
because it's less people. People are a lot more accepting
people, a lot more willing to go fuck with you. You know

181
00:11:29.570 --> 00:11:30.540
what I'm saying? So.

182
00:11:30.870 --> 00:11:35.790
Tony Kaizen:
So now we got some a...a couple "Would you rather..."
questions that we think might be interesting for you.

183
00:11:36.200 --> 00:11:39.590
Kairo Omar:
I know I talk a lot too, my fault.

184
00:11:39.590 --> 00:11:43.750
Tony Kaizen:
That's what we're here for, but it's perfect! We just talked
to a dude, and was like, we was asking him questions. I was

185
00:11:43.750 --> 00:11:48.360
like, "So what do you love about the US?" He was like, "I
don't know." I was like, "Well, what do you not like about

186
00:11:48.420 --> 00:11:53.550
it?" "I don't know." "What do you think of when you think
the United States?" "I don't know." It's like, bro, why did

187
00:11:53.550 --> 00:11:53.610
you...

188
00:11:53.610 --> 00:11:54.950
Kairo Omar:
You're not trying for real.

189
00:11:55.040 --> 00:11:59.700
Tony Kaizen:
...you said you wanted to do this. Why you don't wanna talk?
I don't get it. I don't get it. All right. So here we go.

190
00:11:59.700 --> 00:12:03.150
The first question is, would you rather have more money or
more time?

191
00:12:04.780 --> 00:12:10.460
Kairo Omar:
More time. Like word, too, more time. Because it's like, I
had a...I had a mentor tell me this shit one time. It's

192
00:12:10.460 --> 00:12:15.780
like, I don't have time, I have leverage, you know? I'm
saying I'm 19, out of that my life expectancy, I'm supposed

193
00:12:15.780 --> 00:12:21.100
to crap out when I turn 80, you know what I'm saying? I
don't know that on some real shit. I would much rather have

194
00:12:21.100 --> 00:12:25.170
more time and know for a fact that I have more time than I
have more bread. Because, like, what the fuck is bread gonna

195
00:12:25.170 --> 00:12:30.080
buy me when I'm dead, right? You know, like on some real
shit, you know, I'm saying at least with time, I know I can

196
00:12:30.080 --> 00:12:33.900
work towards something else. I know I can move towards
something else. I know I can I know I can cherish my time

197
00:12:33.900 --> 00:12:38.620
here longer. You know, having bread, it's nice. It gives me
a little bit of peace of mind, you know what I'm saying? I

198
00:12:38.810 --> 00:12:44.320
can go buy Waffle House, you know, like when I'm hungry and
shit at night, right? But it's not, word, you know what I'm

199
00:12:44.320 --> 00:12:48.100
saying? But it's not the same, you know, it's like at least,
at least with time, at least then I know I can walk to the

200
00:12:48.100 --> 00:12:52.690
Waffle House instead, you know, I can. I can make something
happen for myself, you know? So definitely more time.

201
00:12:53.160 --> 00:12:58.200
Tony Kaizen:
Why do you think people don't understand that concept? Why
do you think people chase money, money, money, money, money,

202
00:12:58.200 --> 00:13:00.540
but they disregard time completely?

203
00:13:01.050 --> 00:13:06.010
Kairo Omar:
Bro, I just feel like cos...I just wrote a paper on this
shit, actually. Right? Yeah, word. And then, I feel like it

204
00:13:06.180 --> 00:13:11.740
involves...I feel like, again, this is part of the culture
that we're a part of. You know what I'm saying, it's like,

205
00:13:11.740 --> 00:13:16.650
obviously, money is important for the culture that we live
in, for the society that we live in. But I feel like once

206
00:13:16.650 --> 00:13:23.080
people kind of understand that, like, yo, like what if, what
if money wasn't important? You know what I'm saying, people

207
00:13:23.080 --> 00:13:27.650
like, "Oh shit, well, what am I doing with my life?" You
know what I'm saying? And it's like, and I feel like you

208
00:13:27.710 --> 00:13:32.330
need, you kind of need that...You need, you need to have the
time to take a step back in order to ask yourself, "What am

209
00:13:32.330 --> 00:13:36.300
I doing in my life?" You know what I'm saying? "What am I
putting my time towards?" You know, should I...Literally

210
00:13:36.300 --> 00:13:42.040
just like like being in college and having a lot more free
time on my hands and I'm you know, that I'm used to, I sit

211
00:13:42.040 --> 00:13:46.040
back, I'm like, "Yo, what the fuck am I doing with my life?"
You know what I'm saying? Say, bro, like I turned down, I

212
00:13:46.080 --> 00:13:53.790
turned down an internship with, with Dell to go to South
Africa with my school over the summer. 12k! I turned down

213
00:13:53.790 --> 00:13:58.480
12k to go on a free trip to South Africa! You know what I'm
saying? But it's like, would you...I know, right? That's

214
00:13:58.480 --> 00:14:04.440
crazy and shit. Alright. I made that choice. Right? And now
and that came after a lot of, like, debating with my parents

215
00:14:04.440 --> 00:14:08.800
and myself, you know? But it became a matter of like, all
right, cool. But it's like, I can, I'm not gonna say I can

216
00:14:08.800 --> 00:14:14.320
make 12k anywhere because you can't make 12k anywhere! You
can't! You know, but it's like I, I kind of chose it like,

217
00:14:14.320 --> 00:14:19.660
alright, but like, do I want to experience something? Do I
want to go work at a company that isn't really going to

218
00:14:19.660 --> 00:14:24.380
fulfill me the way that I wanted to? You know, sometimes and
again, it's like, I'm young. I can make that choice, you

219
00:14:24.380 --> 00:14:30.480
know what I'm saying? I can afford to pass up on 12k in my
youth, you know what I'm saying? But I also know, like in

220
00:14:30.510 --> 00:14:34.990
ten, 15 years from now, it might not be the same, you know?
And so that's why, again, it's like it's about how do I

221
00:14:34.990 --> 00:14:39.260
value my time now? How am I spending my time now? You know
what I'm saying? Because bread can come later, money can

222
00:14:39.260 --> 00:14:43.170
come later on some real shit, you know what I'm saying?
Like, I'm not pressed about...I'm also a computer science

223
00:14:43.170 --> 00:14:45.700
major. So I'm not really...I'm not really stressed about
bread on some real shit.

224
00:14:45.700 --> 00:14:49.180
Tony Kaizen:
You ain't...you ain't pressed for money, dog. Not in that..
not in that field.

225
00:14:49.180 --> 00:14:52.280
Kairo Omar:
Yeah, yeah. You know, so...And so...But again. But there's
benefits to that, you know what I'm saying, like, not

226
00:14:52.280 --> 00:14:56.500
everybody has that luxury, you know, and stuff. Like it's, I
think it's another part of it as well. It's just like

227
00:14:56.500 --> 00:15:01.530
nobody...It's like, for example, it's like at my school...I
don't know how much is going to be put in there, you know

228
00:15:01.530 --> 00:15:05.900
what I'm saying, I just point to me talking for real. It's
like at my school, it's like so many niggas are business

229
00:15:05.900 --> 00:15:10.070
majors, you know, which isn't a bad thing. I totally respect
that, you know what I'm saying. But again, it's just more

230
00:15:10.070 --> 00:15:14.640
about like, like the focus is more in terms of like how are
you spending your time now, right? Just put, you are

231
00:15:14.640 --> 00:15:18.930
dedicating yourself to a degree in which you have to spend
time to make money, you know what I'm saying? The same thing

232
00:15:18.930 --> 00:15:22.440
with me, of course, you know what I'm saying? Anything that
you do in school hours, you got to spend time to do X, Y and

233
00:15:22.440 --> 00:15:26.720
Z. You have to put that work in. But it's a different level
of work, business is a lot more hands on, you know what I'm

234
00:15:26.720 --> 00:15:31.220
saying? You can't afford to take a day off as a business...
I'm sorry...after...you know, once, once you're a business

235
00:15:31.220 --> 00:15:35.560
owner because that's your business, you know? That's how you
make your money; that is your direct stream of income.

236
00:15:35.990 --> 00:15:39.090
Computer science majors, a little bit different. I can tell
you something like, you know what I'm saying? I might be on

237
00:15:39.090 --> 00:15:42.800
call. It's a different...It's a different set up. It's a
different schedule for real, you know? But again, it's just

238
00:15:42.800 --> 00:15:48.890
I feel like...I feel like to answer the question, you know,
right? So word... It is...To answer the question, it's just

239
00:15:48.890 --> 00:15:54.710
more in terms of umm...society that we live in, you know?
It's like I feel like we're just, we're focused on the wrong

240
00:15:54.710 --> 00:15:59.430
shit on some real shit, you know? It's like we're more
focused on how many likes we get than who's liking us for

241
00:15:59.430 --> 00:16:01.330
real in real life, you know? So, yeah.

242
00:16:01.330 --> 00:16:06.550
Tony Kaizen:
Man, that was beautiful! Would you rather lose all the money
you have or all the pictures you have?

243
00:16:08.540 --> 00:16:14.770
Kairo Omar:
All the money I have. I don't know, pictures are important,
umm especially...Especially in this day and age, you...I

244
00:16:15.480 --> 00:16:18.720
personally feel as though it's like, because like the, you
know what I'm saying? Like, because I have like a

245
00:16:18.720 --> 00:16:23.230
smartphone, I may take a lot of pictures. I might never
really look back at it again, you know what I'm saying? So,

246
00:16:23.230 --> 00:16:27.120
not really those pictures, I mean, more of the pictures
like, like, like the actual physical copies, you know what

247
00:16:27.120 --> 00:16:30.610
I'm saying? Like cos those hit different, you know what I'm
saying? Those have...Those have a lot more of a sentimental

248
00:16:30.610 --> 00:16:35.020
value. Those get fucked up, I can't do anything about those,
which is some real shit. You know, I don't want to lose

249
00:16:35.020 --> 00:16:40.990
those, cos...And again, right, it's more about like, it's
the quality of my life versus, you know what I'm saying,

250
00:16:40.990 --> 00:16:45.620
versus the quantity of bread that I have, you know what I'm
saying? Now keep in mind, if I have more money, I can always

251
00:16:45.620 --> 00:16:49.390
go back to the same place. I go say back, I can always go
back to take those same pictures but it's not going to hit

252
00:16:49.390 --> 00:16:54.170
the same. It's not going to be those same memories, you
know? It's a different moment in time. Exactly. I can't

253
00:16:54.170 --> 00:16:58.130
appreciate it the same way, you know? For example, it's like
nothing's going to beat the first time I walk through the

254
00:16:58.300 --> 00:17:02.900
Georgia Aquarium, like, you know, cos it's like, because it
was so fresh to me, it was so new. I can go back and I can

255
00:17:02.940 --> 00:17:06.660
enjoy it the same. I can even hide this time, I'll go back
smoke a blunt, you know what I'm saying? It might be a

256
00:17:06.660 --> 00:17:10.200
different story, right? I don't know if you can put this in
here or not. I'm sorry Imma fuck with y'all bread or not.

257
00:17:10.200 --> 00:17:14.630
You know what I'm saying? But it's like. But, you know. But
you don't say, but just like. Like it's not going to hit the

258
00:17:14.630 --> 00:17:19.400
same. Obviously, it may be a different experience, but it
won't hit the same as my first experience. It's the same way

259
00:17:19.400 --> 00:17:24.970
how it's like walking through my high school the first time.
It was crazy because walking through that shit, it looked

260
00:17:25.030 --> 00:17:29.260
different, it ain't looked the same. It looked odd, you know
what I'm saying? Not even odd, but it just looked off. But

261
00:17:29.260 --> 00:17:33.620
then I got used to it. I'm like, "Oh, that's what, that's
the thing I was looking at before. Now I know why that's

262
00:17:33.640 --> 00:17:38.900
there." Now you pass by, it's old and you get used to it,
but nothing ever beats that first time. Nothing ever beats

263
00:17:38.930 --> 00:17:44.660
that, that first experience. You know what I'm saying? Or at
least the initial, you know. So for that reason, man, fuck

264
00:17:44.660 --> 00:17:46.510
that bread, bro. Give me my pictures back on some shit.

265
00:17:46.510 --> 00:17:50.470
Tony Kaizen:
Yeah, same way, bro, because you're essentially deleting,
like, your memories when you delete all your pictures. You

266
00:17:50.470 --> 00:17:54.610
know what I'm saying? And I used to do that when I was
younger. Like, I would see some pictures and there are some

267
00:17:54.610 --> 00:17:58.050
times you might take a picture of something, years later you
feel embarrassed about it and you look at the picture and

268
00:17:58.050 --> 00:18:01.970
you're like, nah, fuck it. Especially if it's on your phone,
you delete it and then some time will go by, so why the fuck

269
00:18:02.040 --> 00:18:06.650
did I delete that picture? That's a memory, that was
actually me at that moment in time. So like to delete it is

270
00:18:06.650 --> 00:18:11.240
almost like trying to act like it never happened, you know
what I mean? So basically, summarizing what you said, it

271
00:18:11.240 --> 00:18:15.340
sounds like you can always get more money, bro. But you
can't get your memories back if you delete them, you know?

272
00:18:15.580 --> 00:18:21.390
Kairo Omar:
Word, too. Yeah. And I...And I feel like, to your point as
well, I feel like with our generation as well, again, I'm

273
00:18:21.430 --> 00:18:25.130
not really big on social media and all that shit, which is,
you know what I'm saying? Which makes it hard for me, you

274
00:18:25.130 --> 00:18:28.820
know what I'm saying? If I want to do that, it makes it a
little harder to compete. But I feel as though, I feel like

275
00:18:28.820 --> 00:18:34.450
our generation, we're so quick to try to edit aspects of
ourselves. You know what I'm saying? You know, cos it's so

276
00:18:34.510 --> 00:18:38.540
easy to do it on social media, you know what I'm saying?
It's like I can curate how people view me. I can curate how

277
00:18:38.540 --> 00:18:43.370
people see me, you know, it's like, it's like if I don't
put...if I don't put up one.. Up on social media, that don't

278
00:18:43.370 --> 00:18:46.950
mean it didn't happen, that just mean that people ain't see
it. You know what I'm saying? There are pros and cons to

279
00:18:46.950 --> 00:18:51.250
that. You know what I'm saying? Because I know full well if
I want to do X, Y and Z, you know what I'm saying? It's

280
00:18:51.250 --> 00:18:54.780
like, for example, let's say if I want to... Let's say if
I'm trying to become like an A&R, let's say I want to get

281
00:18:54.780 --> 00:19:00.930
signed to a label, if none of my music is on my...is on my
Instagram, if I have no means of people actually seeing that

282
00:19:00.930 --> 00:19:04.940
except for me saying "go check that thing out on Spotify",
yeah, I mean, they're not gonna to listen to it, but it

283
00:19:04.940 --> 00:19:08.440
makes it harder for me to get my voice out. It makes it
harder for you people to connect with me. You get what I'm

284
00:19:08.440 --> 00:19:12.450
saying? Because at the end of the day, it's like, that's the
only way we're connecting nowadays, you know what I'm

285
00:19:12.450 --> 00:19:16.940
saying? I just see social media as kind of like a digital
shroud over all of us. You know what I'm saying? The same

286
00:19:16.940 --> 00:19:20.390
dude over you got. He's up on his phone...I was on my phone
earlier, you know what I'm saying, listen to music, saying,

287
00:19:20.390 --> 00:19:24.360
what you on your phone...going through the questions and
shit. It's like it has a shroud over all of us and it's

288
00:19:24.360 --> 00:19:28.320
like, it allows us to connect in ways that we might never be
able to connect before. I have friends that I made off

289
00:19:28.320 --> 00:19:33.880
social media that know I would never make without social
media. Off rip, you know what I'm saying? But that's just

290
00:19:33.880 --> 00:19:38.140
not...But I...And so that's obviously a benefit of social
media. But I feel like, again, it's like it's giving us too

291
00:19:38.140 --> 00:19:43.070
much power to curate how we're viewed. And so you know what
I'm saying? And to...and to...and to...not only that, but

292
00:19:43.070 --> 00:19:47.140
then to also dictate how we want to view ourselves, you
know, so you get to put your most ideal self out there.

293
00:19:47.140 --> 00:19:51.380
Yeah. Word. You know what I'm saying? It's like obviously
there's nothing wrong with having an ideal self and wanting

294
00:19:51.380 --> 00:19:56.100
to curate that but it's not genuine, you know what I'm
saying? Cos...cos your ideal is just that, it's an ideal.

295
00:19:56.100 --> 00:20:00.020
You shouldn't...I'm not saying you should never reach your
ideal, but come on, like, like...you know what I'm saying?

296
00:20:00.070 --> 00:20:06.510
Tony Kaizen:
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, definitely. Alright, my bro, so we
got five questions about the US. Alright, answer however you

297
00:20:06.510 --> 00:20:11.510
want. The first one is, we kind of touched on it, but what
does the "American Dream" mean to you?

298
00:20:13.650 --> 00:20:18.850
Kairo Omar:
I'll be honest here. Yeah the "American Dream" is a fucking
joke for black people bro on some real shit. Now obviously

299
00:20:18.850 --> 00:20:23.680
there's pros and cons to it. I understand that me being a
black man within this country. I'm sorry. I mean, let me,

300
00:20:23.680 --> 00:20:27.570
let me start off this way. I understand that me being a man
within this country, there are certain things I can just do

301
00:20:27.570 --> 00:20:31.120
that other people cannot do, whether they be, you know what
I'm saying, like, just...just based off of how the

302
00:20:31.120 --> 00:20:38.270
patriarchy is set up, right? That's all for it. Now me being
black as another feature to my existence, umm, which some

303
00:20:38.270 --> 00:20:44.740
might say is great, others might say it's treacherous. It's
honestly both. Umm so in terms of my own perception of the

304
00:20:44.740 --> 00:20:49.490
American dream, I believe it's obtainable, but I believe
it's a lot harder for me to obtain because of who I am and

305
00:20:49.490 --> 00:20:52.730
how I look within this country. So yeah.

306
00:20:52.820 --> 00:20:57.050
Tony Kaizen:
I see. Okay. So how would you describe the "American Dream"
if you had to explain it to somebody who had never heard the

307
00:20:57.050 --> 00:20:57.770
concept before?

308
00:20:58.580 --> 00:21:03.260
Kairo Omar:
The American dream is basically hustle and grind culture.
It's the reason why you're worried more about how much money

309
00:21:03.260 --> 00:21:08.610
you're making versus how much time you spending with your
damn kids on some real shit. There's pros and cons to it,

310
00:21:09.710 --> 00:21:13.810
you know, it's like...No, word, too, right? You know what
I'm saying? But it's like there's pros and cons to it. For

311
00:21:13.810 --> 00:21:18.230
example, it's like, I know if I grind for ten years right
now, I can chill for 30 years later. Now, do I feel like

312
00:21:18.230 --> 00:21:22.530
putting that...do I feel like spending that time? You know
what I'm saying? Do I feel like leveraging my time for those

313
00:21:22.570 --> 00:21:26.490
next ten years to chill out for the next 30 years? That's up
to you. That's up to me. You know what I'm saying? However I

314
00:21:26.630 --> 00:21:30.330
feel like living, however you feel like living. That's what
you want to do with your life like on some real shit. But

315
00:21:30.660 --> 00:21:37.190
the "American Dream" is definitely...it's a...it's a false
promise, though, because capitalism is not going to allow

316
00:21:37.190 --> 00:21:42.590
for that many people to chase they bags at once. Somebody
has to lose. And if you're a minority, it's probably going

317
00:21:42.590 --> 00:21:47.070
to be you. So I'm sorry if you're from another country
watching this shit. My fault, gangster.

318
00:21:47.430 --> 00:21:52.380
Sorry! We don't know what to say! Like you got it next time.
Like you know what I'm saying? Like...but you know, it's

319
00:21:52.380 --> 00:21:57.210
like, I was gonna say, you should have been white, but I'm
not because you can't put that up in there, you know? But

320
00:21:57.210 --> 00:21:58.880
it's a real shit though, you know. So..

321
00:21:58.960 --> 00:22:05.870
Tony Kaizen:
Yeah, yeah, I got you. Now but let me ask you this, though.
Do you think the "American Dream" is universal or specific

322
00:22:06.060 --> 00:22:08.790
to America, or you feel like people from other countries
have that same dream?

323
00:22:09.100 --> 00:22:12.410
Kairo Omar:
I feel like people in other countries definitely have that
same thing because the "American Dream" is based off of

324
00:22:12.410 --> 00:22:17.300
capitalism. But capitalism isn't only unique to the United
States. If you go...you know what I'm saying? Anywhere in

325
00:22:17.300 --> 00:22:20.890
the Western world, you're going to find notions of
capitalism anywhere in the world. You're going to find

326
00:22:20.890 --> 00:22:27.240
notions of capitalism, you know, and you know. And so it's
like obviously, not to mention that the "American Dream" is

327
00:22:27.240 --> 00:22:32.370
not so much about money. It's more about growth. It's more
about what am I able to accomplish? So technically, it's

328
00:22:32.370 --> 00:22:37.290
like, I can find the American dream in...in a...North Korea,
you know what I'm saying? If I just move to the ranks the

329
00:22:37.290 --> 00:22:41.160
way that I'm quote unquote "supposed to", you know what I'm
saying? If I assimilate into that culture, if I move within

330
00:22:41.160 --> 00:22:46.500
that society in a...in a way that's beneficial to that
society, and how can I not win? You know what I'm saying? I

331
00:22:46.540 --> 00:22:51.590
think about it like that. The only issue is like here,
though, I'm black, being black is ant...is antithetical to

332
00:22:51.590 --> 00:22:55.720
growth and success within this country. So how am I really
going to do that? I don't know. I wrote a paper on this. I'm

333
00:22:56.130 --> 00:22:57.100
excited about it!

334
00:22:57.460 --> 00:23:03.390
Tony Kaizen:
I can tell you're passionate about it. I like that, though.
I like that, though. It's not about money, it's the growth.

335
00:23:03.470 --> 00:23:08.500
I never thought about it like that. But, I like that, bro.
Alright, now, sticking with the theme, when you think of

336
00:23:08.500 --> 00:23:14.150
American people, if you had to describe American people to
somebody who had no experience with them, who had never been

337
00:23:14.210 --> 00:23:15.870
here, how would you describe us in general?

338
00:23:16.910 --> 00:23:21.620
Kairo Omar:
I would say ignorant, but not in like a malicious sense. I
mean it more in terms of like we're genuinely unaware of the

339
00:23:21.620 --> 00:23:27.460
world outside of the US, you know? And it's like, it's
because of what we've been taught, you know, it's like

340
00:23:27.810 --> 00:23:32.360
I...cos I interacted with a lot of tourists
before...umm...when I was younger, I interacted with a bunch

341
00:23:32.360 --> 00:23:37.350
of French tourists and they never...they never gave the vibe
like, "Oh, y'all are ignorant...X, Y and Z." But it's just

342
00:23:37.350 --> 00:23:41.120
like, they had definitely had certain preconceived notions
of the US. And then if you look at media as well, you know

343
00:23:41.120 --> 00:23:45.640
what I'm saying? Just like mass media and just say like,
"Oh, Americans, just Americans are this..." I can see how

344
00:23:45.640 --> 00:23:49.610
people might say that. But again, it's just because we're
just not taught about the world outside of the US. We're

345
00:23:49.610 --> 00:23:53.180
kind of taught the US is the US, why, you know what I'm
saying? Who's going to fuck with the US? You know what I'm

346
00:23:53.180 --> 00:23:58.750
saying? Like, it's like, we're so goated. It's not worth
learning about anybody else, you know? It's like...which is,

347
00:23:58.750 --> 00:24:03.530
which is unfortunate, you know? Cos European history is
really rich. African history is really rich. Asian history

348
00:24:03.530 --> 00:24:09.700
is really rich. And it's like, it's important to get...it's
important to, to understand that, you know, I feel like the

349
00:24:09.700 --> 00:24:16.410
US, you know, has been...the US is definitely a melting pot,
but we kind of revere it to such a high standard of like,

350
00:24:16.480 --> 00:24:20.890
"It's this melting pot, we have to know about this!"
Obviously it's important, but it's like we, you know what

351
00:24:20.890 --> 00:24:26.960
I'm saying? But like we definitely fail to be inclusive of
the...of the world around us, you know, in our own personal

352
00:24:26.960 --> 00:24:33.270
educations, you know? So definitely the word "ignorant", but
it's not a willful ignorance. It's more of a...it's more

353
00:24:33.270 --> 00:24:35.830
that we're just not taught better, you know, that's just
some real shit.

354
00:24:36.930 --> 00:24:42.070
Tony Kaizen:
Do you think that the reason we're not more accommodating to
people of other cultures or other countries is specifically

355
00:24:42.070 --> 00:24:44.500
because we're not educated about them or you think it's
something else?

356
00:24:45.790 --> 00:24:50.700
Kairo Omar:
All I'm going to say is it's in a melting pot society, in
which you have so many different cultures, and so many

357
00:24:50.700 --> 00:24:57.510
different religions, and so many different identities being
represented within our country, I genuinely would...you

358
00:24:57.710 --> 00:25:04.440
would think that there would be more education, that there
would be much more diverse education. But there's an idea

359
00:25:04.440 --> 00:25:10.790
called "civil religion" that basically just relates to how
societies and groups, what they hold dear, and what they

360
00:25:10.790 --> 00:25:18.840
genuinely value as a society...as...as a civilization in the
US. Because the United States was built by white cis hetero

361
00:25:20.350 --> 00:25:25.570
males...landowning males. You know what I'm saying? That's
obviously what you're going to see as being reinstituted.

362
00:25:25.570 --> 00:25:29.770
That's what you're going to be valued. That's what's going
to be put into play. That's what's going to be revered. It's

363
00:25:29.770 --> 00:25:36.280
the same reason why we still see Confederate... Confederate
statues still up. You know what I'm saying? Because at the

364
00:25:36.330 --> 00:25:41.640
end of the day, the US was based around white people. You
know what I'm saying? Like being white, you know what I'm

365
00:25:41.640 --> 00:25:47.170
saying? It wasn't based on racism. You know what I'm saying?
Obviously it was. But it's like, they didn't care about "Oh,

366
00:25:47.350 --> 00:25:51.480
you...Oh, you left our country." No, it wasn't about that.
You know what I'm saying? They wasn't really sweating that.

367
00:25:51.480 --> 00:25:56.210
And you can see that, 'cause again, it's the same reason
why...why ideas of the rebellion, why they're still up, you

368
00:25:56.210 --> 00:26:00.470
know? But it's not about that. It was really just more
about...cos again, because the Confederate States of

369
00:26:00.470 --> 00:26:06.740
America, the United States of America, they were so based
off of the same ideas of white males, white cis hetero

370
00:26:06.740 --> 00:26:11.540
landowning males doing whatever the fuck they wanted because
they were white and they were in power, you know? So I'm

371
00:26:11.540 --> 00:26:12.220
sorry, what's your question?

372
00:26:12.650 --> 00:26:18.010
Tony Kaizen:
I was saying, how would you describe American people to
somebody who has no experience with them? You said ignorant,

373
00:26:18.360 --> 00:26:19.390
maybe uneducated.

374
00:26:19.600 --> 00:26:24.590
Kairo Omar:
Oh, yeah, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. And so...and so that as that
relates to our education, it's like I would think that you

375
00:26:24.590 --> 00:26:30.110
would see it more, but you don't because again, because our,
our country was never built to sustain such a type of

376
00:26:30.110 --> 00:26:35.190
education, you know? And think about it too. It's like I
remember, cos the interacting with those same French kids, I

377
00:26:35.190 --> 00:26:42.870
was like 14 when this happened, actually. When I was 14,
it's like, I was talking to them. They were...I obviously

378
00:26:42.870 --> 00:26:46.340
didn't know French. I was...I took in a French class, but
I'm like, who the fuck is paying attention to French class?

379
00:26:46.340 --> 00:26:50.370
More like, you know what I'm saying? I can't do that. I'm
thinking this is me as an American saying this, right? I'm

380
00:26:50.370 --> 00:26:55.280
very ignorant, but like interacting with them, they would be
like, "Oh, you don't know French? Okay, then switch to

381
00:26:55.280 --> 00:26:59.580
Spanish." I don't know fucking Spanish like, you know what
I'm saying? And then they would switch to broken English.

382
00:26:59.580 --> 00:27:04.050
And I was like, "How do you know all this shit?" They learn
all their languages in pre-K...in kindergarten when they're

383
00:27:04.050 --> 00:27:08.430
very young. And again, it's just a part of how we're
educated. You know how hard it is to learn a language by the

384
00:27:08.430 --> 00:27:13.090
time that your mind gets developed? At least if I'm like
six, and you know what I'm saying? As I'm still learning the

385
00:27:13.090 --> 00:27:17.370
world, if I learn a new language while I'm still learning
other stuff, that makes it easier, I can internalize it

386
00:27:17.370 --> 00:27:22.210
more, you know, and that's anything. Like you know what I'm
saying? And so it's like, talking to like these same

387
00:27:22.240 --> 00:27:27.280
foreigners...these foreigners know all these languages for
the sole reason that like, they're, they, you know what I'm

388
00:27:27.280 --> 00:27:32.320
saying? That they, they've had the chance to really sit
there in the language, and learn it, and, you know what I'm

389
00:27:32.320 --> 00:27:36.350
saying? Just absorb it all, you know? And again, that's just
the issue with our...with our own education system. We've

390
00:27:36.350 --> 00:27:38.770
got to improve, for real. So, yeah.

391
00:27:39.340 --> 00:27:43.750
Tony Kaizen:
All right. So "ignorant" and "uneducated". That's how you
can label us.

392
00:27:44.490 --> 00:27:44.610
Kairo Omar:
Yeah.

393
00:27:44.640 --> 00:27:47.470
Tony Kaizen:
All right.

394
00:27:47.470 --> 00:27:53.750
So next one is about cultural behaviors. If you had to give
a recommendation to somebody who has never been here, what

395
00:27:53.750 --> 00:27:59.690
are some things that you think you should never do, or say,
which we were talking about earlier. What are some things

396
00:27:59.690 --> 00:28:01.670
you should never do or say in the United States?

397
00:28:03.120 --> 00:28:11.770
Kairo Omar:
Keep "nigga" out your mouth. And a...and I say that for the
sole reason, that racial tension...it can be felt throughout

398
00:28:11.770 --> 00:28:16.250
the world. We know the type of world that we live in, you
know? Even if you don't know, you know, and...and if you

399
00:28:16.250 --> 00:28:21.270
don't know, you definitely know! You know what I'm saying?
But again, but it's like within the US, it's there...it's

400
00:28:21.270 --> 00:28:27.570
very different within the US because it's become so
centralized and it's become so central to our country's

401
00:28:27.570 --> 00:28:35.600
social makeup and to our country's culture. It's definitely
very...so whenever you come to the US, keep it out of your

402
00:28:35.600 --> 00:28:39.950
mouth. You know what I'm saying? Also understand, too, that
we're all people here, which goes back into that whole point

403
00:28:39.950 --> 00:28:44.750
as well. Everybody we respect, you know, we're going...we're
going to try to treat you with as much respect as possible.

404
00:28:44.750 --> 00:28:52.210
But again, right, it's like somebody being respectful to you
is more of a...people thing or the US thing. So yeah,

405
00:28:52.210 --> 00:28:58.970
definitely. And it also depends on where you're at as well.
If you're in New York, don't drive slow. Niggas will honk at

406
00:28:58.970 --> 00:29:04.910
you, they will violate you. Umm but yeah, you know what I'm
saying? You gotta...you have to understand, too, that it's

407
00:29:04.910 --> 00:29:09.720
like, especially in the US, because we're big up on grind
culture, a hustle culture, trying to get the bag by any

408
00:29:09.720 --> 00:29:15.080
means. It's definitely a lot faster paced, so definitely be
prepared for that. The food portions are a lot bigger if

409
00:29:15.080 --> 00:29:18.260
you're from like, you know what I'm saying? If you're from
Europe, you're going to be just like, there's a lot more

410
00:29:18.350 --> 00:29:25.020
food. We waste a lot of shit here, which is unfortunate, you
know, but it's true. Umm so, yes, I would definitely just

411
00:29:25.020 --> 00:29:28.110
say be wary of those. Not even be wary of those things, you
know what I'm saying? But just like, we live in a very

412
00:29:28.110 --> 00:29:33.170
expensive world, there's a lot going on, especially in the
US. It's very fast. So just try to appreciate it for what it

413
00:29:33.170 --> 00:29:39.740
is, you know? Don't try to just...just...I guess try to move
with it, you know? So assimilate, which is kind of wild,

414
00:29:39.740 --> 00:29:41.630
but, you know what I'm saying? Just move with it, you know?

415
00:29:41.630 --> 00:29:47.260
Tony Kaizen:
So "when in Rome, do as the Romans," as they say, yeah. And
just don't say "nigga". There you go.

416
00:29:47.580 --> 00:29:48.650
Kairo Omar:
We'll stick it right here.

417
00:29:49.120 --> 00:29:56.460
Tony Kaizen:
A big ass thing on the screen. "Don't say 'nigga'". There
you go. There you go. All right. Now this one, people have

418
00:29:56.460 --> 00:30:01.980
had a hard time answering, so we'll see your opinion on it.
If you had to describe the American beauty standard, we can

419
00:30:01.980 --> 00:30:06.250
start with women and then we'll go to men. If you had to
describe the beauty standard and maybe give your thoughts on

420
00:30:06.250 --> 00:30:06.760
it, what would you say?

421
00:30:07.800 --> 00:30:13.660
Kairo Omar:
I feel like the American beauty standard...again, because we
understand...I...we understand the world that we live in. I

422
00:30:13.780 --> 00:30:21.010
feel as the American beauty standard definitely does cater
towards white women, you know...in a... in a...right? In a

423
00:30:21.230 --> 00:30:28.380
Eurocentric sense. But I would also definitely believe that
the beauty standard is changing. But...but changing in what

424
00:30:28.380 --> 00:30:33.020
regard? Why they're changing? If you look at the
fetishization of black women, you know what I'm saying? Is

425
00:30:33.020 --> 00:30:36.960
it changing for the good or is it changing because black
women are fetishized? You know what I'm saying? Doesn't...it

426
00:30:37.020 --> 00:30:42.800
doesn't...then that is...word, it's my fault...It doesn't
necessarily mean that they're not beautiful, you know? But

427
00:30:42.800 --> 00:30:46.550
again, but it's just more of like, why is it shifting in
that direction? Why...you know what I'm saying? Why are they

428
00:30:46.550 --> 00:30:50.420
being revered in this way? That's something...I think it's
something that's important for us to think about. As it

429
00:30:50.420 --> 00:30:54.920
relates to beauty standards, again, it's like there is
technically no set beauty standards within the US. Now, if

430
00:30:54.920 --> 00:30:59.220
you look at billboards, you know what I'm saying? Like if
you see a billboard you might see like, bikini models or X,

431
00:30:59.220 --> 00:31:04.670
Y and Z or whatever the fuck. Obviously it might have that
certain ideas are being reflected back to you, you know what

432
00:31:04.670 --> 00:31:08.700
I'm saying? In terms of like body shape and body...I'm
saying skin tone and all that shit, you know what I'm

433
00:31:08.700 --> 00:31:13.250
saying? It's like, so I guess like, for the
actual...so...you know what I'm saying? So, so, so what's

434
00:31:13.250 --> 00:31:14.520
being put out for us to consume.

435
00:31:14.970 --> 00:31:15.890
Tony Kaizen:
That's what I'm talking about. Yeah.

436
00:31:16.150 --> 00:31:20.540
Kairo Omar:
Got you! In that aspect then, yeah, I would definitely
say...it would definitely be like a no...slimmer, petite

437
00:31:20.610 --> 00:31:23.850
figure. You know what I'm saying? White women, light-skinned
women, you know what I'm saying? It's like the lighter you

438
00:31:23.890 --> 00:31:27.790
are, the better on some real shit. Obviously, that's not
true. You know what I'm saying? Because, again, beauty is a

439
00:31:27.790 --> 00:31:34.270
relative thing. How we perceive beauty is definitely up to
us as...as...as individuals, as people, umm...so yeah, but I

440
00:31:34.270 --> 00:31:39.260
also feel as though, once you understand that there's
definitely a disconnect between corporation culture and

441
00:31:39.260 --> 00:31:43.790
like, human culture within the US and that's anywhere, you
know what I'm saying? But, but what's interesting is that

442
00:31:44.230 --> 00:31:50.200
there's a disconnect, you can begin to appreciate it more.
For example, as a black man, I think black women are

443
00:31:50.200 --> 00:31:52.760
beautiful! Like, "Why, aren't you Spelman College?" I got to
represent!

444
00:31:52.820 --> 00:31:53.660
Tony Kaizen:
Shoutout, Spelman!

445
00:31:53.660 --> 00:31:58.200
Kairo Omar:
Shoutout to Spelman! You know the vibes, right? I believe
black women are extremely beautiful, you know? But then I

446
00:31:58.200 --> 00:32:01.400
also understand...Okay, but also might think white women are
beautiful; Asian women are beautiful, and you know know what

447
00:32:01.400 --> 00:32:05.910
I'm saying? Like my beauty...like my perception of beauty is
not limited to something like race, which is something that

448
00:32:05.910 --> 00:32:09.820
you might see here! You know what I'm saying? And which...I
might see anywhere, for in all honesty, you know what I'm

449
00:32:09.820 --> 00:32:13.960
saying? Because you control the money, white people, you
know what I'm saying? But you know...so I feel like in that

450
00:32:13.960 --> 00:32:20.570
aspect, yeah that's what the beauty standard is, ummm but
don't let it...don't let it limit you. Free your mind. I'll

451
00:32:20.570 --> 00:32:21.140
be your third eye.

452
00:32:23.670 --> 00:32:29.210
Tony Kaizen:
Now what about men? When you think about...let's call it the
beauty standard for men in America, what do you think that

453
00:32:29.210 --> 00:32:33.720
is most put out there or that...how do you think you're
expected to look or present yourself visually?

454
00:32:35.310 --> 00:32:41.790
Kairo Omar:
Again, I feel like...I feel like it starts off with bodies,
like, you know, if I'm...if I'm too slim, I might not be

455
00:32:41.790 --> 00:32:47.860
seen as, quote unquote "attractive". If I'm too big, I might
not see seen as quote unquote "attractive", you know? But

456
00:32:47.860 --> 00:32:53.000
everybody has their own different body types on some shit.
Umm I feel like for men as well, there are definitely

457
00:32:53.000 --> 00:33:00.460
certain beauty standards. Within the US itself it's
considered...I'm saying this more as a black man, you know

458
00:33:00.460 --> 00:33:05.080
what I'm saying? As a black man is that there are certain
things that I quote unquote "cannot do" because it might be

459
00:33:05.080 --> 00:33:09.200
seen as feminine or it might be seen as...or it might
emasculate me, demasculate me.

460
00:33:09.200 --> 00:33:09.920
Tony Kaizen:
Like what, for example?

461
00:33:10.160 --> 00:33:14.430
Kairo Omar:
So, for example, if I get like, my nails done, you know what
I'm saying? Like, if I...if I groom myself in a certain way,

462
00:33:14.430 --> 00:33:18.740
people might think, "Oh, what are you doing? Why are you
doing X, Y and Z?" As somebody who's never gotten a manicure

463
00:33:18.740 --> 00:33:22.450
or a pedicure, I'm not opposed...I'm not opposed to the
idea. I just never really have the time to do it or go out

464
00:33:22.450 --> 00:33:26.680
and do it. But I feel like it's definitely important to
understand that, again, beauty standards are relative. How

465
00:33:26.680 --> 00:33:31.440
you perceive things are relative. Umm you know...and it's
like how you define yourself is how you define yourself, you

466
00:33:31.440 --> 00:33:34.710
know what I'm saying? Like, you can't really let people
speak for you cos again, the only person that know you is

467
00:33:34.710 --> 00:33:40.600
you, on some real shit. But I feel like as it relates to, as
it relates to men and, you know, as it relates to men

468
00:33:40.600 --> 00:33:47.260
and...and just like how beauty standards are definitely
a...taken in, a...it definitely does build a lot of...and

469
00:33:47.260 --> 00:33:52.680
the US stuff is built a lot around body type, you know? But
again, once you like, again, if you look at the billboards,

470
00:33:53.210 --> 00:33:58.080
I'm not built like the...like the Calvin Klein nigga! I'm
not, I'm sorry. I can get there...you gotta give me a couple

471
00:33:58.080 --> 00:34:01.700
of years, you know what I'm saying? But it's like, again,
it's something to work towards. And again, I feel like

472
00:34:01.750 --> 00:34:06.520
that's what the beauty culture in America does as well. It
kind of forces people to try to move in a certain way. It

473
00:34:06.550 --> 00:34:10.790
kind of makes people try to say, "Okay, well, Imma try to do
X, Y and Z. Imma try to work towards this." But it's not

474
00:34:10.820 --> 00:34:14.110
fair to you. You know what I'm saying? It's like you're
human, bro. It's like...like I'm...you know what I'm saying?

475
00:34:14.110 --> 00:34:17.250
Like, I'm not...shit, like, fucking, like...like...I'm a
slim nigga! You know what I'm saying? Come on!

476
00:34:17.320 --> 00:34:19.600
Tony Kaizen:
Shoutout to the skinny dude and the short kings, shoutout to
'em!

477
00:34:19.600 --> 00:34:24.060
Kairo Omar:
Word. Exactly. Exactly. Word. You know? It's like...it's
like that's something for us to work towards. But again,

478
00:34:24.100 --> 00:34:28.880
it's like, beauty standards are so fucking constrictive
anywhere, especially in this country. It kind of stresses

479
00:34:28.880 --> 00:34:32.140
people out, you know? So fuck beauty standards, everybody's
beautiful!

480
00:34:32.570 --> 00:34:35.350
Tony Kaizen:
Now, you mentioned before that black women specifically are
getting fetishized.

481
00:34:35.640 --> 00:34:36.640
Kairo Omar:
Hmm. Black men, too.

482
00:34:36.940 --> 00:34:39.680
Tony Kaizen:
What have you seen that has made you think that? How do you
think that's happening?

483
00:34:40.480 --> 00:34:46.100
Kairo Omar:
I mean, it's...I understand as a black man, there are
certain ways in my thinking which definitely point to that,

484
00:34:46.100 --> 00:34:51.520
you know what I'm saying? Umm but again, it's like, it's not
hard to...it's not hard to look. I mean, Imma talk about

485
00:34:51.570 --> 00:34:56.170
porn. I don't know if y'all can say this, you know what I'm
saying? But it's like, yo, look at the porn industry! Look

486
00:34:56.170 --> 00:35:02.350
at...look at...Look at white porn titles versus black porn
titles. "Black thot gets rimmed by..." Like no! I don't give

487
00:35:02.350 --> 00:35:06.720
a fuck! Like come on! Like...it's...it's real shit! It's
real...let's be real here, you know what I'm saying? Compare

488
00:35:06.720 --> 00:35:12.060
it to like, oh, "Skinny white girl..." Like no, come on!
Like you know...it's...again, it's like, it's a...it's about

489
00:35:12.060 --> 00:35:16.330
languages being used. We live in a country that's inherently
racist, that because I'm black or that's not what they see

490
00:35:16.330 --> 00:35:22.030
me as a black person, you know what I'm saying? Let's be
real here. So it's like obviously I understand that

491
00:35:22.030 --> 00:35:29.900
like...so when I speak on fetishization, it's, it's because
I live in a culture that wants to seem villainized, that

492
00:35:29.900 --> 00:35:33.980
wants to see me brought down, wants to see me demean as a
black person. You know what I'm saying? For the sole reason

493
00:35:33.980 --> 00:35:39.190
that I'm black. You know what I'm saying? What's considered
quote unquote "black", it's... it's become more of a...it's

494
00:35:39.190 --> 00:35:44.410
a, it's a, it's a, it's a...it's a social thing. You know
what I'm saying? Ideas of blackness, for example...right.

495
00:35:44.410 --> 00:35:49.980
It's like...It's like these sneakers are black, you know
what I'm saying? Because part of it...because it's a...part

496
00:35:49.980 --> 00:35:54.520
of a trend that us as consumers, as black people, as we
continue to buy into these things, it becomes labeled as

497
00:35:54.520 --> 00:35:55.940
"black". You know what I'm saying?

498
00:35:56.120 --> 00:35:59.330
Tony Kaizen:
These are white. Skater shoes...the pants. You know what
what I'm saying? Yeah, for sure.

499
00:35:59.370 --> 00:36:02.480
Kairo Omar:
Yeah, exactly. Word, you know what I'm saying? And so it's
like, and then if you think about like, Jor...by the way you

500
00:36:02.480 --> 00:36:08.200
got Jordans on, right? Same thing with him or like, those
are considered quote unquote "black" thing. All right, cool.

501
00:36:08.200 --> 00:36:11.610
You know what I'm saying? But why is that? Because as a
community, cos we continue to buy into things like this.

502
00:36:11.610 --> 00:36:16.670
Why? Because these same corporations, they're going to put
forward certain ideas for us to buy into this shit. We fuck

503
00:36:16.670 --> 00:36:21.310
with Jordan because Michael Jordan is black! You know what
I'm saying? Like if Michael Jordan was some white dude out

504
00:36:21.310 --> 00:36:26.000
of, like, out of fucking Idaho, we wouldn't give a fuck, you
know? Which is some real shit. And a...and again, too, it

505
00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:30.640
was like, look at...look at Kanye West. We continue to fuck
with Kanye West because Kanye West is black. If Kanye West

506
00:36:30.640 --> 00:36:33.710
was this white person saying, "Oh, this shit", but still
making this good ass music, I wouldn't hit this thing. We

507
00:36:33.710 --> 00:36:37.580
was like, "Oh, Kanye's racist. We can't fuck with Kanye
West", but you know what I'm saying? But again, it's

508
00:36:37.580 --> 00:36:42.400
like...it's like it's how you perceive shit on a, on a, on
a, on a, on a social, on a racial level. Because at this

509
00:36:42.400 --> 00:36:48.750
point, race has become so intertwined with socioeconomic
status, with...with social status within this country, it's

510
00:36:48.790 --> 00:36:53.440
very hard to parse the two. You can't...you can't divide
them. It's so difficult, you know, as you... you watch

511
00:36:53.440 --> 00:36:53.770
Atlanta?

512
00:36:54.040 --> 00:36:54.960
Tony Kaizen:
Yeah, of course, bro.

513
00:36:54.960 --> 00:37:02.150
Kairo Omar:
Bro, alright. But looking at season...it's fire! It goes
crazy! Looking at season three of Atlanta, there's episodes

514
00:37:02.150 --> 00:37:10.020
of du...a...a...the most recent episode...you watch...it was
wild as shit, right? But what I'm trying to highlight is

515
00:37:10.020 --> 00:37:15.500
this. In like the very first scene, she's running around in
the Nike Tech suit. Why? You know what I'm saying? Why is he

516
00:37:15.500 --> 00:37:19.290
running...why is he running in a Nike tech suit? That...that
was my question. But I'm thinking, that's not a black thing.

517
00:37:19.330 --> 00:37:23.580
That's not a white thing. It's just a thing, that's...that's
something for people to consume. But I'm so, as a black man,

518
00:37:23.580 --> 00:37:28.130
I'm so used to saying, "Okay, well, why is he wearing that?"
You know what I'm saying? "Why is this white man wearing a

519
00:37:28.130 --> 00:37:33.680
Nike Tech suit?" And then even looking at that...even the
music he's listening to as well. "Why is he listening to

520
00:37:33.760 --> 00:37:37.990
some trap shit?" You know what I'm saying? Which isn't a bad
thing, right? Because that's what he chooses to listen to.

521
00:37:37.990 --> 00:37:43.750
But even still, it's just like, the consumption...what we
consume as consumers, what is, you know what I'm saying?

522
00:37:43.750 --> 00:37:48.780
What is being put out for us to listen to? Why is it being
put out in such a way? For example, it's like, if you look

523
00:37:48.780 --> 00:37:55.730
at rap...if you look at rap music, people say rap music is
dangerous, it's a...it's misogynistic, it's X, Y, and Z. How

524
00:37:55.730 --> 00:38:01.050
dare they say X, Y and Z and all that is true! It's true.
You know what I'm saying? Shit like...shit...as I...as much

525
00:38:01.050 --> 00:38:06.470
as I bump Future, Future's a toxic nigga! But I still listen
to Future. You know what I'm saying, though? But it becomes

526
00:38:06.470 --> 00:38:11.030
a matter of...okay...But like why? You know what I'm saying?
But if rap music is so dangerous...dangerous...if it's so

527
00:38:11.030 --> 00:38:16.820
dangerous, if it's so bad, if it's...if it's a...if it's
such a taboo thing, why is it still being consumed? Why are

528
00:38:16.820 --> 00:38:20.420
people, especially white people? Because, again, you gotta
think about who is music being made for. The music industry

529
00:38:20.420 --> 00:38:26.130
is made to cater towards white people. So why is it still
being consumed? Because it gives white people the chance

530
00:38:26.570 --> 00:38:30.460
to...to fire back at black people by saying, "Okay, well,
they're X, Y, and Z. Look at how they dress. Look at what

531
00:38:30.460 --> 00:38:35.440
they say about their women. Look at how they treat X, Y, and
Z." But we know it's not true. It's a constant reaffirming

532
00:38:35.440 --> 00:38:39.790
cycle. You know what I'm saying? You know what I'm saying?
But again. But it's like, but it's like, the issue is...but

533
00:38:39.840 --> 00:38:44.240
it's because...it's because we're so occupied by a system
that doesn't wanna see us win. So it's like, for example, if

534
00:38:44.240 --> 00:38:48.750
I know that...if you look at Megan Thee Stallion, right?
Megan Thee Stallion, that's her living her best life. That's

535
00:38:48.750 --> 00:38:53.990
her...That's her... That is her explaining her experiences
as a black woman in a way that she understands. Fuck these

536
00:38:53.990 --> 00:38:56.710
niggas! What does she wanna say? You know what I'm saying?
If that's how she wanna say it, that's what she wanna say.

537
00:38:56.710 --> 00:38:59.750
Scam all these niggas, cool, right? I'm not even listening
to Megan Thee Stallion, you know what I'm saying? So she

538
00:38:59.750 --> 00:39:03.930
says what she's saying, but again. But it's also us like.
But it's like it's more about how is it being perceived. But

539
00:39:03.930 --> 00:39:08.810
it's not her job to control how she's perceived. It's her
job to put out art! She's not trying to just throw it

540
00:39:08.810 --> 00:39:12.630
together just to say, "Oh, I don't know if people like
this." Then that's not really being a genuine artist. That's

541
00:39:12.630 --> 00:39:15.650
a different story, you know what I'm saying? That goes for
any artist, you know what I'm saying? I love you, Meg. If

542
00:39:15.650 --> 00:39:20.370
you want to slot to Morehouse, I love you. So you know what
I'm saying? Right. But it's like, but you know, that goes

543
00:39:20.370 --> 00:39:27.370
for any artist. So it's like I definitely feel as though, we
have to be more aware. So just be aware like on some shit,

544
00:39:27.590 --> 00:39:27.790
like...yeah.

545
00:39:28.120 --> 00:39:34.930
Tony Kaizen:
I dig it. So last two questions. They're kind of like
opposites. What do you love about the USA specifically? What

546
00:39:34.930 --> 00:39:35.810
do you love about your country?

547
00:39:36.130 --> 00:39:39.900
Kairo Omar:
I love the fact that I can be any type of person that I
wanna be here. That's one thing for sure. There are

548
00:39:39.900 --> 00:39:45.380
definitely certain freedoms...there are definitely certain
social freedoms.

549
00:39:45.380 --> 00:39:47.090
Tony Kaizen:
He did a calculation in his head real quick.

550
00:39:47.120 --> 00:39:52.990
Kairo Omar:
Quick, right, word. Language is important, on some real
shit. Right? Language is important. Umm, there are certain

551
00:39:52.990 --> 00:39:59.960
social freedoms that I'm awarded just by living in this
country. For example, if I were gay, living in this country

552
00:40:00.540 --> 00:40:05.000
would be easier for me than if I was living in another
country. It doesn't mean that my existence here would be

553
00:40:05.150 --> 00:40:09.940
easier compared to everybody else's, cos there obviously are
still certain biases in place, and certain way than people

554
00:40:10.030 --> 00:40:16.530
think. But if I was in Saudi Arabia, which is just a
different...I understand it's just a different a...way of

555
00:40:16.530 --> 00:40:20.810
living. It's a different...it's a different standard of
living as a gay person. You know what I'm saying? Just

556
00:40:20.810 --> 00:40:25.710
between these two different places. So there's that for
sure. That's something I definitely appreciate. Umm I have

557
00:40:25.710 --> 00:40:30.700
the chance to...not only that, but because the US is so
expansive, there's so much going on, there's so many people

558
00:40:30.700 --> 00:40:37.080
here, I can...I can take in a lot without having to leave
the US, you know, which is another great thing too, which

559
00:40:37.080 --> 00:40:39.950
is, which is a benefit of the US. So those two things most
definitely.

560
00:40:40.600 --> 00:40:45.350
Tony Kaizen:
Okay. Now what do you...it's hard to use this word, but what
do you hate about the country or what do you wish was

561
00:40:45.430 --> 00:40:47.770
different? What would you change if you had the chance?

562
00:40:48.450 --> 00:40:49.900
Kairo Omar:
Umm not change.

563
00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:52.790
I mean, you already know what I would change! Right?

564
00:40:52.790 --> 00:40:55.380
Tony Kaizen:
I know one of 'em. I know one of 'em for sure.

565
00:40:55.580 --> 00:41:01.380
Kairo Omar:
But I...but...but I talk for so long but Imma try to be
short of course. Umm what would I change? I would definitely

566
00:41:01.380 --> 00:41:07.260
try to...bro, we need free shit! Which sound...Not...not
only like random free shit. I mean, like free health care,

567
00:41:07.850 --> 00:41:11.650
something like a...you know what I'm saying? Cos health
care...and again, it's like, and this country is very

568
00:41:11.650 --> 00:41:18.400
capitalistic. The reason why grind culture is so big here is
because it's the only way you can really live your life

569
00:41:18.710 --> 00:41:25.350
peacefully. That's the only way you can get the shit that
you need and need is a strong word. Because if I need to go

570
00:41:25.350 --> 00:41:31.740
to a doctor so I don't die and I can't afford it, all of a
sudden I'm living in a system that's meant to see me lose

571
00:41:32.110 --> 00:41:36.760
because I can't afford it. The money, you know what I'm
saying? At that point, as a society we've come to...as a

572
00:41:36.760 --> 00:41:43.570
society, I mean at that point as a society, we've come to
value wealth more than human life. And it's an issue...we

573
00:41:43.570 --> 00:41:49.270
gotta...should...stop! Come on, we're better than that! Come
on, come on. Right? We're better than that. So that would be

574
00:41:49.290 --> 00:41:54.280
something that I would try to change. I would definitely try
to reinstate certain...certain ideas or certain practices

575
00:41:54.280 --> 00:41:59.210
that would just help us remember that as much money as we
make, if somebody dies, that's something that you're not

576
00:41:59.210 --> 00:42:03.640
getting back. You can always make the bread back. You can
always create more money. I know you can. You can always

577
00:42:03.640 --> 00:42:07.420
print more money. You know what I'm saying? It's like, you
know, it's like...it's just...just trying to...try to, I

578
00:42:07.420 --> 00:42:11.640
guess, like, reinstate the...that thinking, that way of
thinking of just caring for each other again. It's

579
00:42:11.640 --> 00:42:12.060
important.

580
00:42:13.860 --> 00:42:18.170
Tony Kaizen:
Apart from the capitalistic part, apart from the
corporations and businesses and stuff like that, do you

581
00:42:18.170 --> 00:42:22.730
think that American people in general don't really care much
for each other? Like we're so individualistic that we're

582
00:42:22.770 --> 00:42:24.960
really not worried about anybody else or you think
differently?

583
00:42:26.040 --> 00:42:33.400
Kairo Omar:
I feel like there definitely is a basin...there's a
definitely...a baseline sense of care. That's only when

584
00:42:33.400 --> 00:42:38.270
there's somebody else coming and...and making us feel some
type of way, you know?

585
00:42:38.270 --> 00:42:38.910
Tony Kaizen:
What do you mean?

586
00:42:39.550 --> 00:42:43.590
Kairo Omar:
I'll put it this way. It's like, God forbid that...you know
what I'm saying? It's like, you know, shooting...after

587
00:42:43.730 --> 00:42:48.450
shoo...like when I was in high school had to go through an
active shooter drill. So being... that really is an

588
00:42:48.450 --> 00:42:51.520
American-ass sentence to say that's fucking crazy! You know
what I'm saying? Right?

589
00:42:51.520 --> 00:42:54.480
Tony Kaizen:
So, just for anybody who doesn't understand. Can you say
that again? You had to do what in school?

590
00:42:54.580 --> 00:42:55.770
Kairo Omar:
An active shooter drill.

591
00:42:55.830 --> 00:42:56.940
Tony Kaizen:
And can you explain what that is?

592
00:42:57.180 --> 00:43:04.170
Kairo Omar:
So basically, it's like, gun violence is a large issue in
the United States. Umm just based off of the way that our

593
00:43:04.170 --> 00:43:09.460
laws are set up. And so it's like, throughout the US there
have been a number of times in which like, you've seen armed

594
00:43:09.460 --> 00:43:16.780
individuals go into schools or go into public areas with
firearms and to try to do people harm. And actually for

595
00:43:16.780 --> 00:43:21.590
me...actually it wasn't...we actually thought it was real,
but it ended up being just a big mix up on some shit. It was

596
00:43:21.590 --> 00:43:25.960
like a fucking water gun that somebody was walking by with,
you know what I'm saying? But it was still kind of like, "Oh

597
00:43:25.960 --> 00:43:26.940
shit!", you know what I'm saying?

598
00:43:26.940 --> 00:43:29.090
Tony Kaizen:
It's common sense there's a shooter in the school, that's
not a thing you take lightly.

599
00:43:29.310 --> 00:43:35.270
Kairo Omar:
Word, too, right? But it's just like, in that aspect, seeing
how people came together in my high school... obviously

600
00:43:35.270 --> 00:43:38.750
we're all friends in my high school, you know what I'm
saying? But seeing how people came together, it meant

601
00:43:38.750 --> 00:43:43.670
something. I feel like on a microcosmic level, that's what
I'm trying to...that's the point I'm trying to make. Until

602
00:43:43.670 --> 00:43:48.760
something...until something foreign comes in, we all really
fuck with each other. Even black people don't really fuck

603
00:43:48.760 --> 00:43:52.420
with each other. Like, you know what I'm saying? Like, let's
be real, you know? But, you know what I'm saying? It's

604
00:43:52.420 --> 00:43:56.780
like...but like, we gotta think to ourselves, why?
Not...no...I'm not gonna...I'll be here for another hour.

605
00:43:56.780 --> 00:44:03.310
You know what I'm saying? Though it's just like...it's
about...the love...the love for each other is definitely

606
00:44:03.310 --> 00:44:08.850
here in this country. But we just have to be willing to love
each other when it's not convenient. You know what I'm

607
00:44:08.850 --> 00:44:14.290
saying? We have to love each other when we want it, not when
we need it. You get what I'm saying? Yeah, because, you

608
00:44:14.290 --> 00:44:14.860
know, like...yeah.

609
00:44:14.860 --> 00:44:21.280
Tony Kaizen:
I get that same impression. Like, kind of, you said, it's
kind of like a lot of people think that Americans are very

610
00:44:21.440 --> 00:44:26.250
reserved or cold or that we all just hate each other,
especially here in the South. It's mainly black and white

611
00:44:26.250 --> 00:44:30.990
people and they think we're just at each other's necks all
the time. But I try to explain to people all the time, that

612
00:44:31.030 --> 00:44:37.170
in general, we get along pretty well. Like, I mind my
business, you mind yours, I don't fuck with you. You don't

613
00:44:37.170 --> 00:44:43.890
fuck with me. For the most part, that's the way it is. And
then, people will say, like, "We see so much racism on TV,

614
00:44:43.890 --> 00:44:48.360
we see so much hatred and stuff like that on social media."
But I just don't think that's really the case. I think

615
00:44:48.360 --> 00:44:53.690
that's perpetuated online. And then people see that and they
assume that's the way it is. So when you see a white person

616
00:44:53.690 --> 00:44:57.610
walking down the street, you guys maybe don't make eye
contact, you try to keep your distance. So I think there's a

617
00:44:57.610 --> 00:45:03.030
lot of a...lack of communication going on cos when you just
sit down and talk to somebody like this, I don't know you,

618
00:45:03.180 --> 00:45:07.620
we just met today. You see, most people are fucking cool,
bro, you know what I'm saying? And like you said, when

619
00:45:07.620 --> 00:45:14.030
tragedy strikes, whatever it is most of the time, however
way it happens, people do come together and take care of

620
00:45:14.030 --> 00:45:18.890
each other, you know what I'm saying? So I think there are
certainly racist people, ignorant people, hateful people.

621
00:45:18.890 --> 00:45:23.210
But for the most part, I've been all over this country and
most people are pretty fucking cool as long as you show

622
00:45:23.210 --> 00:45:23.590
respect.

623
00:45:23.840 --> 00:45:27.440
Kairo Omar:
Exactly. Word. And that's the thing, too. It's like I feel
like people don't understand that respect is kind of like a

624
00:45:27.440 --> 00:45:32.680
two-way street, you know? It's like if you're not willing to
give it, you're not going get it. You know, it's like...cos

625
00:45:32.740 --> 00:45:35.960
if I come...I came over here, I could be like, "Fuck you
nigga, walk away!", that would've been wild and shit,

626
00:45:35.960 --> 00:45:39.970
obviously, you know what I'm saying? But it's like, but then
if you were like, "Oh, word?" And then we started scrapping

627
00:45:39.970 --> 00:45:44.090
like...that would have been my fault! Like in a way...you
know what I'm saying? Cos again, it's about...it's a two-way

628
00:45:44.090 --> 00:45:49.340
street. So it's like, you gotta show the respect to get the
respect here, on some serious shit. But I always...but that

629
00:45:49.340 --> 00:45:51.260
don't mean that you're always going to get that respect
back.

630
00:45:51.260 --> 00:45:52.780
Tony Kaizen:
It don't always work. We'll just say that.

631
00:45:52.820 --> 00:45:55.850
Kairo Omar:
Word, you know, that's not an American thing, that's more of
a human thing, you know what I'm saying? That person can be

632
00:45:55.850 --> 00:46:00.910
having that bad day, you know, but it's like, that's that
person, that's not you, you know? So...that's not...you know

633
00:46:00.910 --> 00:46:05.460
what I'm saying? It's like, don't, don't...I'm not gonna say
don't sweat shit. But it's just like, don't...

634
00:46:05.930 --> 00:46:07.890
Tony Kaizen:
Don't sweat shit you can't control at the end of the day,
right?

635
00:46:08.180 --> 00:46:11.910
Kairo Omar:
Exact...exactly. Word. You know what I'm saying? You know
what you can work on. If you're trying to learn English,

636
00:46:12.180 --> 00:46:16.240
right? Which you...I hope you're...right? Word. Make sure
you learn English from this dude right here. Right? It's

637
00:46:16.240 --> 00:46:20.620
like, you know, you can control that. You just gotta lock in
with it. You know, it's like you...you can control...focus

638
00:46:21.090 --> 00:46:23.750
on what you can do right now. Don't focus on what you can do
later.

639
00:46:24.080 --> 00:46:29.770
Tony Kaizen:
I dig that, bro. I appreciate that. Kairo...I really
appreciate it, bro. This is a great interview. Best one so

640
00:46:29.800 --> 00:46:32.060
far. We appreciate that.

641
00:46:32.060 --> 00:46:40.820
Yeah, I was just about to ask you. Let me get your social
before we go. Definitely gonna put that in there. You said

642
00:46:40.820 --> 00:46:42.810
you got? What do you...Instagram? Okay, cool.

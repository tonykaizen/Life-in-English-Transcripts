12
00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:50.560
So, the man speaking in this clip today is Les Brown, a motivational speaker from Miami, Florida.

13
00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:57.630
Now I came across Les a couple of months ago on TikTok, and even though I'm not really into, like, the motivational speaker type thing,

14
00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:03.110
When I hear Les speak, he does it like in a more captivating and unique way.

15
00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:06.940
It doesn't feel like a motivational speech when I listen to him talk, you know?

16
00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:09.350
It sounds a lot more like somebody who's just passionately,

17
00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:13.570
Yet humbly passing life's lessons on to his listeners, you know?

18
00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:18.250
Like, there's no fluff, there's no rah rah go conquer the world type shit.

19
00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:19.880
It's just real talk. You know what I'm saying?

20
00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:24.370
So I'll definitely be sharing more of Les's speeches in the future on the podcast.

21
00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:31.130
But today I'm going to play the clip, explain the words and phrases that I think might be difficult to understand or that you've never heard before.

22
00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:34.690
Then I'll leave you with a few things to think about and we'll get out of here.

23
00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:37.290
As always, my friend. So let's not waste any more time.

24
00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:40.600
Let's get into this episode. Let me play the clip.

25
00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:49.960
...(He) taught me three things, he said, "If you want to become successful in life, young man,"

26
00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:53.750
He said, "number one, you got to change your mindset."

27
00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:57.290
He said, "you don't get in life what you want, you get in life, what you are."

28
00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:02.950
Number two, practice OQP, only quality people.

29
00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:07.700
You earn within 2 to $3,000 dollars of your closest friends.

30
00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:11.350
Used to be so broke, I passed the bank and tripped the alarm. You know?

31
00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:20.500
And the third thing, he said, develop your communication skills because once you open your mouth, you tell the world who you are.

32
00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:29.400
All right y'all, so let's dig into these life lessons that Les Brown was gracious enough to share with us,

33
00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:34.580
But actually before we do that I want to share some definitions and explanations of a couple of words and phrases

34
00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:39.820
That I think or I imagine might not be so easy to understand or that you haven't been exposed to yet.

35
00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:42.870
So, starting with number one, mindset.

36
00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:47.790
He said, "You need to change your mindset if you want to change your life" right? That's the idea.

37
00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:56.730
And a mindset is a fixed mental attitude or disposition that predetermined a person's responses to and interpretations of situations.

38
00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:02.230
That's a very wordy definition that basically describes a way of thinking.

39
00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:07.160
That's another definition of mindset, it's just the way you think about things, you know.

40
00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:12.170
And the way you think about things predetermines the way you respond to or interpret situations, right?

41
00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:13.170
So it's all kind of the same.

42
00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:19.630
Now, the next word is get. He said, "You don't get in life what you want. You get in life who you are" right?

43
00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:23.980
So in this context, the word 'get' means to receive or to obtain, right.

44
00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:27.880
So you don't obtain in life what you want. You don't receive in life what you want.

45
00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:30.720
You obtain or receive who you are.

46
00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:34.680
Now the next thing I wanted to bring to your attention is actually the same sentence.

47
00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:42.100
He said, "You don't get in life what you want. You get in life who you are" right? Or what you are, I think is what he said.

48
00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:49.010
So if you notice words that end with a T, that are also followed by words that start with a Y,

49
00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:52.640
We end up connecting those words by making a TCHU sound.

50
00:03:52.640 --> 00:04:00.130
So instead of saying "You don't get in life what you want" you say "You don't get in life what you want".

51
00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:04.130
'What' ends with a T, 'you' starts with a Y and we connect those words and say what you want.

52
00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:06.610
Now, this isn't something you have to do.

53
00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:10.980
It's just something that I wanted to bring to your attention because many times when we speak fast,

54
00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:17.090
We connect all kinds of words and this is a pattern that you'll notice all the time when we speak.

55
00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:19.760
Is if it ends, if a word ends with the Y is followed by word...

56
00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:24.640
Excuse me, if the word ends with a T and is followed by a word that starts with the Y

57
00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:31.060
Almost every time we connect those words and make a TCHU sound right there in the middle. All right?

58
00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:34.600
But let's move on. The next word I wanted to explain was 'earn'.

59
00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:39.650
In lesson number two he said, "You earn within 2 to $3,000 of your closest friends".

60
00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:43.540
So the word 'earn' in this case E A R N, earn.

61
00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:47.870
It's a formal word for make or receive money.

62
00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:52.090
So if you earn money, you are making money or receiving money, it's all the same.

63
00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:55.960
Earn, I think is just a formal word for that. You see what I'm saying?

64
00:04:56.410 --> 00:04:59.730
A much more common word at least here in the U.S is make money.

65
00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:06.790
Like, I make $80,000 a year. I make $20 an hour. I make or I made $500 last week.

66
00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:12.300
You see? We use the verb 'make'. But you can use receive or earn, they're just more formal options.

67
00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:19.160
All right, cool. Now, the next word is in the same sentence 'within' W I T H I N, within.

68
00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:22.920
You earn within 2 to $3,000 of your closest friends.

69
00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:30.770
So in this context, the word 'within' means not exceeding the fixed limits of, or not beyond, or no more than.

70
00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:37.650
So you are going to earn or make or receive no more than 2 to $3,000 of your closest friends.

71
00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:39.670
That's the idea. Ok?

72
00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:46.360
Now, the next phrase or the joke that he told "I used to be so broke, I passed the bank and tripped the alarm".

73
00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:52.690
So the word broke, it's just like, I guess you could say it's slang for having absolutely no money.

74
00:05:52.690 --> 00:05:57.110
So somebody says, like "Yo man, I'm broke" it means I have no money. Zero dollars.

75
00:05:57.430 --> 00:05:59.610
Or at least that's what they want you to think, right?

76
00:05:59.930 --> 00:06:08.160
Now, trip the alarm, to trip the alarm means to set off the alarm or unintentionally activate the alarm. That's what it means.

77
00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:15.240
So I used to be so broke just by walking or passing by the bank, I tripped the alarm or set off the alarm. Ok?

78
00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:19.940
Now, the last thing I wanted to explain is when he said "once you open your mouth"

79
00:06:20.510 --> 00:06:24.780
And that's just another way of saying once you start talking, because obviously when you talk you open your mouth.

80
00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:30.040
Now, you probably already knew that. But just in case, if you didn't, now you know.

81
00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:36.710
Alright y'all, let's get into the actual lessons from this clip, starting with number one. Change your mindset.

82
00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:42.020
You don't get in life what you want, you get in life who you are or what you are.

83
00:06:42.780 --> 00:06:46.130
Now you probably heard this one said in one of a few different ways. Right?

84
00:06:46.980 --> 00:06:49.200
Whatever you put out, you get back.

85
00:06:50.340 --> 00:06:53.090
Your thoughts produce your reality.

86
00:06:53.090 --> 00:06:55.530
Whether you think you can or can't, you're right.

87
00:06:56.540 --> 00:07:01.080
Think positive thoughts. The way you see the world is a reflection of your beliefs.

88
00:07:01.890 --> 00:07:04.860
If you go looking for something, you're going to find it. Right?

89
00:07:05.390 --> 00:07:09.230
All of these phrases point to the idea that your mind is an incredibly powerful tool,

90
00:07:09.700 --> 00:07:13.310
And it's literally creating what you've come to know as your life experience.

91
00:07:14.490 --> 00:07:17.970
Your thoughts determine the actions you take and your actions determine the life you live.

92
00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:24.550
Now, unfortunately for most people, the lives they live only reinforce the thoughts that they have habitually,

93
00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:28.150
Which further reinforces the actions they take habitually,

94
00:07:28.410 --> 00:07:30.880
Which only continues to create the same life experience.

95
00:07:31.890 --> 00:07:34.090
And this is what we call a negative feedback loop.

96
00:07:34.980 --> 00:07:39.150
One negative thing influences the next in this endless cycle, you know?

97
00:07:39.150 --> 00:07:44.370
And what I believe Les is saying is that if you want to escape that negative feedback loop,

98
00:07:44.370 --> 00:07:46.960
You have to change what created the loop in the first place.

99
00:07:47.760 --> 00:07:50.820
You have to change the way you think if you want to change the way you behave,

100
00:07:51.510 --> 00:07:57.040
And you've got to change the way you behave if you want to have a better or even just different life experience.

101
00:07:58.130 --> 00:08:00.620
So how about a practical example, so you can really understand?

102
00:08:02.290 --> 00:08:06.260
I used to be a very negative person because I was unhappy with myself

103
00:08:06.740 --> 00:08:12.150
And because I was unhappy with myself I was unhappy with the world and everyone in it, everything in it.

104
00:08:12.150 --> 00:08:18.200
I just was not a fulfilled, happy, positive person. You know what I'm saying?

105
00:08:18.470 --> 00:08:24.940
And because of that, I saw and thought about everything in life in a negative way. You see what I'm saying?

106
00:08:24.940 --> 00:08:28.050
I would like just naturally look for the worst in people.

107
00:08:28.440 --> 00:08:32.640
I could find a problem in any situation. I could find the negative in any situation.

108
00:08:32.640 --> 00:08:37.970
I was quick to criticize. I was very, like, skeptical and all these things.

109
00:08:37.970 --> 00:08:42.340
It was just nothing positive about the way I thought, the way I talked, the way I behaved.

110
00:08:42.340 --> 00:08:43.210
It was all negative.

111
00:08:44.470 --> 00:08:50.530
So what that did was create a negative life experience, like if I'm always just thinking on a negative frequency,

112
00:08:50.530 --> 00:08:56.780
If I'm always looking for the negative in a situation or always looking for the negative in the person I'm talking to or the people around me.

113
00:08:57.340 --> 00:09:01.300
That's what I'm going to find. It's just more negativity. You see what I'm saying?

114
00:09:01.300 --> 00:09:06.230
If I'm always looking for negativity. If I'm always putting out negativity into the world.

115
00:09:06.230 --> 00:09:07.550
That's exactly what's going to come back to me.

116
00:09:08.550 --> 00:09:13.700
And then when that comes back to me, it obviously doesn't feel good to, like, have a negative life experience.

117
00:09:13.700 --> 00:09:18.690
So all that negativity coming back just makes me feel even more negative and unhappy.

118
00:09:18.690 --> 00:09:23.210
And then I put more of that out into the universe, which creates that negative feedback loop I was talking about.

119
00:09:23.740 --> 00:09:32.210
So it's like, just the mindset alone, just the way I chose to look at the world that created the world that I saw.

120
00:09:32.210 --> 00:09:35.000
Right, you're going to see what you're looking for.

121
00:09:35.970 --> 00:09:42.080
So it was only, I think it was maybe like 2000... What year was this?

122
00:09:44.570 --> 00:09:47.210
I don't know, like 2017, 2018 something like that.

123
00:09:47.370 --> 00:09:54.390
A few years ago that I came across Dr. Jordan B Peterson and his teachings and his lessons and things like that,

124
00:09:54.390 --> 00:09:57.780
The videos he was putting on YouTube and eventually his books and everything.

125
00:09:58.710 --> 00:10:03.990
I think that was really like the catalyst for me in switching my mindset from negative to positive,

126
00:10:04.330 --> 00:10:09.810
Really coming to understand that the only difference between a fucking miserable human being

127
00:10:10.300 --> 00:10:14.910
And one that's happy is choices.You know what I'm saying?

128
00:10:15.240 --> 00:10:18.330
Like, and it's much deeper than that, obviously,

129
00:10:18.330 --> 00:10:23.250
Like you have to get to know yourself and you have to learn to understand yourself and things like that to understand,

130
00:10:23.250 --> 00:10:29.740
Like, why you even think the way you do today. What influenced your way of thinking and being, you know?

131
00:10:30.850 --> 00:10:33.440
Basically, why you are the person that you are.

132
00:10:33.440 --> 00:10:38.680
You have to kind of start to understand those things and analyze those things if you want to make positive changes.

133
00:10:39.640 --> 00:10:43.760
Not just now, but ones that last and have a lasting impact on your future.

134
00:10:44.320 --> 00:10:46.970
Hopefully, I'm making sense here. I didn't write this down.

135
00:10:46.970 --> 00:10:53.000
I'm kind of just speaking off the cuff. But that's what it is man, it's all about your mindset.

136
00:10:53.080 --> 00:10:55.740
If you look for the positivity, you're going to find it.

137
00:10:56.110 --> 00:10:58.160
If you look for the negativity, you're going to find it.

138
00:10:58.160 --> 00:11:03.370
If you choose to focus on someone's positive attributes, you'll see them in a positive light,

139
00:11:03.370 --> 00:11:06.990
and then hopefully you can build something with that person, or at least just keep it friendly and cordial.

140
00:11:07.460 --> 00:11:11.680
You know what I mean? But if you only see the negative, if you only criticize, if you're always judging,

141
00:11:11.680 --> 00:11:18.970
If you're always skeptical about everything. Never have anything positive to say or contribute to your own life or somebody else's,

142
00:11:19.810 --> 00:11:22.230
You know, just going to be a miserable human being.

143
00:11:22.280 --> 00:11:28.350
And I know for a fact, you know somebody like that.You know somebody who's just a fucking miserable person.

144
00:11:28.430 --> 00:11:32.020
And for that reason, they have to make everybody around them fucking miserable.

145
00:11:33.130 --> 00:11:38.770
Just like you probably come into contact with somebody who was just so happy, so fulfilled, so at peace,

146
00:11:39.380 --> 00:11:40.830
That that also had an effect on you.

147
00:11:41.220 --> 00:11:46.280
Like, you feel good when they're in your presence, they make you smile, they engage with you. You know what I'm saying?

148
00:11:46.280 --> 00:11:51.800
They don't feel the need to gossip or start problems or criticize other people or talk shit. Nothing like that.

149
00:11:52.510 --> 00:11:56.320
And if that type of person makes you feel uncomfortable and irritated, unhappy,

150
00:11:56.320 --> 00:11:59.500
It's probably because you're a miserable motherfucker.

151
00:11:59.620 --> 00:12:02.300
You know, I'm not trying to call you out. I'm just saying.

152
00:12:03.490 --> 00:12:07.510
It's something to think about. It's really something to think about.

153
00:12:07.510 --> 00:12:11.920
Your mindset is one of the most important things to develop, regardless of your age.

154
00:12:11.920 --> 00:12:15.190
It doesn't matter if you're 16 or 76, bro.

155
00:12:15.380 --> 00:12:22.770
So, anyway, let me summarize by saying you're going to get what you're looking for.

156
00:12:22.940 --> 00:12:24.850
Whatever you go looking for, you're going to find it, bro.

157
00:12:24.850 --> 00:12:34.130
So you can choose to look for positivity opportunities, you know, peace, friendship, happiness, money, prosperity.

158
00:12:34.130 --> 00:12:42.980
You can choose to focus on and look for those things as opposed to negativity, skepticism, criticism, gossip, fucking toxicity,

159
00:12:42.980 --> 00:12:45.730
All that other shit you can choose to focus on one or the other.

160
00:12:46.110 --> 00:12:49.690
Whichever one you focus on is what you're going to start to create and manifest and life.

161
00:12:50.890 --> 00:12:57.770
Which then in turn, influences how you think and feel, which in turn influences what you experience, it just never ends. All right?

162
00:12:57.950 --> 00:12:59.920
I'm gonna leave it at that. I'm sure I've got my point across.

163
00:12:59.920 --> 00:13:08.040
So let's move on to lesson number two, which is only quality people or OQP. I like that.

164
00:13:08.040 --> 00:13:10.100
And this one is more important than you might think.

165
00:13:11.160 --> 00:13:16.200
A lot of people are hanging around friends or staying in relationships that don't serve them or their life's purpose in any way.

166
00:13:16.200 --> 00:13:20.340
I'm not saying that you should only be friends with people that can do things for you.

167
00:13:20.950 --> 00:13:25.940
But I am saying that the people you keep in your social circle will have an influence on you, whether you believe it or not.

168
00:13:27.350 --> 00:13:33.590
If you hang around with five bum ass niggas every day, eventually you're going to be bum ass nigga number six.

169
00:13:34.510 --> 00:13:39.170
It's just the way it is. If you hang around soccer players, eventually you're going to play soccer.

170
00:13:40.210 --> 00:13:43.390
If you hang around drug dealers, eventually you're going to do or sell drugs.

171
00:13:43.620 --> 00:13:47.090
If you hang around millionaires, eventually you're going to learn about their mindset,

172
00:13:47.350 --> 00:13:51.650
Their daily habits and the things that they had to do in order to become rich.

173
00:13:52.630 --> 00:13:53.480
It's just the way it is.

174
00:13:54.330 --> 00:13:59.060
The type of conversations you have with people tends to change depending on the type of group it is, right?

175
00:14:00.290 --> 00:14:03.090
Or whatever you're talking about is what you're thinking about.

176
00:14:04.110 --> 00:14:05.960
Whatever you're thinking about is what you're focused on,

177
00:14:06.030 --> 00:14:08.920
And whatever you're focused on is what you begin to manifest in life.

178
00:14:10.310 --> 00:14:15.190
So if you're always talking about and thinking about nonsense that doesn't serve your life's purpose in any way

179
00:14:15.440 --> 00:14:17.790
Or improve or enrich your life in any way.

180
00:14:18.340 --> 00:14:20.370
What type of life experience would you expect to have?

181
00:14:21.930 --> 00:14:24.660
One full of nonsense. Instead of one full of achievement.

182
00:14:25.920 --> 00:14:30.990
By hanging out with and listening to people that have done the things you want to do, you'll learn how to do those things too.

183
00:14:32.140 --> 00:14:36.590
By hanging out with and listening to millionaires talk about their money, investments and businesses,

184
00:14:36.800 --> 00:14:39.070
You'll come to understand how to become a millionaire.

185
00:14:40.090 --> 00:14:46.020
You'll notice that the behavior and daily habits of millionaires are quite different from those of most of the people around you.

186
00:14:47.180 --> 00:14:50.690
You'll understand that it's mainly a question of, number one, mindset.

187
00:14:51.510 --> 00:14:56.650
Number two, your network. And number three, something that we call soft skills, right?

188
00:14:56.650 --> 00:15:01.970
Which leads us to Les's third and final piece of advice. Develop your communication skills.

189
00:15:02.870 --> 00:15:05.980
Once you open your mouth, you tell the world who you are.

190
00:15:08.350 --> 00:15:13.920
That's a code line, bro. Once you open your mouth, you tell the world who you are.

191
00:15:15.790 --> 00:15:19.460
He said it a lot better than I did. He got the voice for it, too. He should have his own radio show.

192
00:15:19.900 --> 00:15:28.230
But anyway. As times goes by, excuse me, as time goes by, I've gotten a lot less interested in teaching language

193
00:15:28.230 --> 00:15:30.990
And a lot more interested in teaching communication skills.

194
00:15:31.800 --> 00:15:35.390
In my opinion, communication is at the base of everything we do in life,

195
00:15:36.290 --> 00:15:39.250
And language is just one of the tools that we use to communicate.

196
00:15:39.890 --> 00:15:43.880
Now, of course, I still find language fascinating and I found a way of teaching it that I enjoy.

197
00:15:43.880 --> 00:15:48.490
But I've come to understand that it's not just what you say, it's how you say it.

198
00:15:49.820 --> 00:15:53.990
Your choice of words, the intonation of your voice, the expression on your face,

199
00:15:53.990 --> 00:15:56.700
How fast you talk, how loud or quiet you are.

200
00:15:57.410 --> 00:16:01.140
There are a bunch of things that influence how your message is sent and received.

201
00:16:02.210 --> 00:16:06.160
Now, all of these things fall under the umbrella of communication, not language.

202
00:16:07.020 --> 00:16:09.680
And they all tell people something about you when you speak.

203
00:16:10.700 --> 00:16:13.620
And whether we like it or not, we're leaving impressions on people and,

204
00:16:13.620 --> 00:16:17.210
they're making judgments about us simply because of the way we express ourselves.

205
00:16:18.320 --> 00:16:23.850
So I really believe that improving your communication skills is one of the most important things you can do to be successful in life,

206
00:16:24.150 --> 00:16:25.500
No matter what it is you want to do.

207
00:16:26.740 --> 00:16:29.810
I don't recommend being fake or manipulative with your words in any way,

208
00:16:29.810 --> 00:16:33.860
But I do recommend that you learn more about how to use your words to move people.

209
00:16:34.890 --> 00:16:38.080
And when I say move people, I mean, influence people. Right?

210
00:16:38.980 --> 00:16:44.720
Learning how to express yourself in a clear and engaging way so that people better understand you and feel more connected to you.

211
00:16:45.640 --> 00:16:51.390
Learning about the art of storytelling and understanding the power of being able to deliver a message through an entertaining story.

212
00:16:52.480 --> 00:16:57.790
Studying the art of communication and learning how to have more of the positive interactions that you want to have.

213
00:16:58.040 --> 00:17:02.050
Instead of the awkward and unpleasant ones that most of us have when we don't know how to talk to somebody.

214
00:17:03.510 --> 00:17:07.920
I could talk for hours about communication itself, because it's just so fascinating,

215
00:17:08.210 --> 00:17:10.320
And I really think it's the key to everything that we want in life.

216
00:17:11.980 --> 00:17:14.160
You want money, you've got to communicate.

217
00:17:15.280 --> 00:17:17.810
You want a girlfriend or boyfriend, you've got to communicate.

218
00:17:18.140 --> 00:17:22.670
You want to get a job, you have to communicate. You want to travel, you've got to communicate.

219
00:17:22.930 --> 00:17:25.170
You want peace, you've got to communicate.

220
00:17:25.370 --> 00:17:29.560
You want food, water, shelter, you've got to communicate.

221
00:17:29.890 --> 00:17:32.110
The list just goes on and on and on.

222
00:17:33.250 --> 00:17:36.260
So do not underestimate the importance of communication.

223
00:17:36.260 --> 00:17:40.190
And I know you're focused on improving your English and speaking fluently right now.

224
00:17:40.190 --> 00:17:45.090
But what good is being fluent in a language if you don't know how to use the language effectively?

225
00:17:47.480 --> 00:17:50.480
If you don't remember anything else from this episode, remember this.

226
00:17:51.510 --> 00:17:53.720
There are a lot of things that can contribute to your success.

227
00:17:54.300 --> 00:17:58.350
But mastering the art of communication is at the very top of the list.

228
00:17:59.840 --> 00:18:04.480
Without communication, we have nothing. Absolutely nothing.

229
00:18:04.740 --> 00:18:08.990
So in my mind, it only makes sense to invest some time into learning how to communicate effectively,

230
00:18:09.250 --> 00:18:14.290
So we can properly share our true selves with the world around us and also get what we truly want out of life.

231
00:18:15.110 --> 00:18:21.390
Whatever that may be. So, my friend, I really hope this episode gave you something interesting to think about,

232
00:18:21.390 --> 00:18:25.760
And I hope that you and I can continue to learn and grow together in this coming year.

00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:06.050
What's up, my friend? If you're feeling bad about yourself,
if you're feeling insecure, if you're feeling like you have

2
00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:13.540
nothing to offer the world, then I've got a quick message
for you. Now, before I can get my message across to you, I

3
00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:19.600
need you to think about something first. Cristiano Ronaldo.
Lionel Messi.

4
00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:23.210
LeBron James. Gary Vaynerchuk.

5
00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:33.820
Jeff Bezos. What do all of these men have in common? You
might say things like they're all rich, famous, and the best

6
00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:40.460
at what they do. And those things may be true, but there's
something even deeper and more important that led them all

7
00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:45.960
to be rich, famous, and incredibly successful. Confidence.

8
00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:54.460
One cannot accomplish great things in life without
confidence in oneself. Confidence comes from one or two

9
00:00:54.460 --> 00:01:03.770
places. Number one, someone who believes in you so much that
you begin to believe in yourself. Number two, watching

10
00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:10.100
yourself do something you didn't know or believe you could
do in the first place. Now, assuming you don't have the

11
00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:17.990
former, because many of us don't, you'll need to do the
latter. See what I'm saying? You need to do something. You

12
00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:26.380
need to accomplish something. And why do you think a lot of
people who go to the gym regularly tend to have lots of

13
00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:33.980
confidence? It's because they're constantly choosing to do
something difficult. They're constantly watching themselves

14
00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:41.700
achieve a difficult task. They know that while everyone else
is at home on the couch watching Netflix, eating junk food,

15
00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:49.420
and scrolling on social media, they are at the gym lifting
heavy shit. Not because it's their favorite thing to do in

16
00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:56.770
the world, but because they know it's good for them. And I'm
obviously generalizing. They know they're neither better nor

17
00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:01.890
worse than other people, but they're certainly on a
different level. They're the type of people who take on

18
00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:09.160
challenges voluntarily and they don't quit when shit gets
difficult. They know they're capable of being consistent.

19
00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:19.500
They show up again and again and again, month after month,
year after year. And they don't see results immediately, and

20
00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:27.160
that's okay, because they know how to defer gratification in
order to receive a greater reward in the future. Watching

21
00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:34.780
oneself go from 100 kilos to 75 kilos breeds confidence. It
also increases the chance that one will like what they see

22
00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:40.650
when they look in the mirror, which will breed even more
confidence. And it's also a constant reminder that no matter

23
00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:48.230
how bad things get, one is capable of turning one's life
around. That knowledge breeds confidence in oneself.

24
00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:57.070
What about Cristiano Ronaldo? Why do you think he has so
much confidence, so much confidence that people think he's

25
00:02:57.070 --> 00:03:05.990
an arrogant human being? Why do you think that is? I think
it's because he wasn't born a footballing genius. He had to

26
00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:15.140
work his ass off every single day for years. Years of blood,
sweat, and tears to get to where he is today. Right? No one

27
00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:21.210
gave that to him. He decided he was going to be the best
footballer he could possibly be, and he worked toward that

28
00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:28.570
goal every day until he realized it. In fact, he continues
to realize it, right? Because greatness is a lifestyle. It's

29
00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:36.500
a mentality. It's not a destination. You wanna party, chase
girls, and get drunk with your friends? That's cool. Imma be

30
00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:43.140
at the gym working on my endurance, agility, and strength.
You're thinking about how much money you can make, but I'm

31
00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:48.950
thinking about how I can perform better than my competition,
because that always leads to more money. You see what I'm

32
00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:56.300
saying? Cristiano Ronaldo has watched himself become one of
the best football players to ever play the game

33
00:03:56.300 --> 00:04:05.570
professionally. But no one has ever kicked a single ball for
him. No one has ever showed up to practice for him. He chose

34
00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:12.130
to take on a difficult task, learn a skill and improve it,
and to try to be the best version of himself every single

35
00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:19.750
day. And from what I understand, he also has an incredibly
loving and supportive mother, and that can make any man

36
00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:29.490
unstoppable in this game we call life. So if you don't feel
confident in yourself, if you feel like you have nothing to

37
00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:36.690
offer, what do you think you should do? Do something you can
be proud of.

38
00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:43.590
You're already learning how to communicate in English, and
that's something no one can do for you. It's also something

39
00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:50.950
no one can take from you. That's something you can be proud
of. Commit to hitting the gym consistently and getting in

40
00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:57.370
shape, learn how to play the saxophone, go to more social
functions and talk to people until you're no longer afraid

41
00:04:57.420 --> 00:04:59.920
of them. Quit doing drugs.

42
00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:09.440
Create unique and engaging content that can't be found
anywhere else. Just do something. Just fucking do something.

43
00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:15.870
Anything, bro. Just do something. When you have hobbies,
when you when you take on difficult tasks, you don't have

44
00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:22.920
time to wallow in self-pity and fucking negativity and
obsess over all your shortcomings because you're too busy

45
00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:29.180
doing shit. You see what I'm saying? You'll have things to
talk about when somebody asks you, "What the fuck are you

46
00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:34.600
doing with your life?" This naturally makes you a more
interesting person, which naturally makes you more

47
00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:43.430
confident. You'll come to realize that the only person's
approval you really need is your own. When you truly feel

48
00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:50.680
good about yourself, you don't really care how other people
feel about you. So how do you start feeling better about

49
00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:59.380
yourself? By working on yourself, by investing in yourself,
by spending your time doing difficult, productive, and or

50
00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:08.410
creative things voluntarily. So at some point today, I want
you to take a long, hard look at yourself in the mirror and

51
00:06:08.410 --> 00:06:17.430
ask yourself the following. Number one. What exactly...or
excuse me, why exactly don't I feel good about myself?

52
00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:25.130
Is it because I don't know how to do anything valuable? Is
it because of toxic people in my life? What's the reason?

53
00:06:25.150 --> 00:06:30.700
What's the source of this feeling? Number two.

54
00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:41.530
What's a valuable skill? I'd like to know. Software
development, carpentry, sustainable agriculture...it could

55
00:06:41.530 --> 00:06:48.270
be anything. It really doesn't matter. And number three,
what's the simplest thing I can do to get started

56
00:06:48.520 --> 00:06:55.550
immediately? It's hard to spend time feeling bad about
yourself when you're already spending all of your free time

57
00:06:55.550 --> 00:06:59.580
trying to improve yourself. So get to work.

Malik:

9
00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:11.690
Tony Kaizen:
Alright, cool. So, Malik, can you describe, in your idea, of
the perfect day?

10
00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:14.270
Malik:
Perfect day? Personally?

11
00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:14.570
Tony Kaizen:
Yeah.

12
00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:20.810
Malik:
Um, I wake up about 5:00, 5:30, um, take a shower.

13
00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:24.250
I feed my dog, we go for a little walk, I go to the gym.

14
00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:25.190
Tony Kaizen:
What kind of dog do you have?

15
00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:26.230
Malik:
I have American bullies.

16
00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:27.730
Tony Kaizen:
Amercian bullies. Okay.

17
00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:32.910
Malik:
Yeah, I go...I go to the park and play a little bit, uh,
morning workouts are the best for me, to be honest. You know

18
00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:38.990
what I'm saying? It wakes me up, get my mind ready for the
day. I go to work, I go to the office. You know what I'm

19
00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:40.460
saying? I work at this corporate job right now.

20
00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:41.640
Tony Kaizen:
Okay, doing what?

21
00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.810
Malik:
I do like home health right now.

22
00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:44.690
Tony Kaizen:
Home health.

23
00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:47.990
Malik:
Yeah, I got three degrees. I'm about to go to law school.
Yeah. So I'm just doing this...

24
00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:49.580
Tony Kaizen:
You're an underachiever, I think.

25
00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:56.310
Malik:
Yeah, trying to. But um, after that, I mean, just chill,
meal prep, you know, just chill with my friends or

26
00:00:56.310 --> 00:00:56.810
something, work out.

27
00:00:56.810 --> 00:01:00.270
Tony Kaizen:
What's the diet look like? What do you typically eat or
prepare for your meal plan?

28
00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:09.980
Malik:
Um, I eat salmon, a lot of green stuff, salads, jasmine
rice, um, chicken, and protein shakes, fruit smoothies. What

29
00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:13.130
is that? Like...Ah-see-ya bowls. Eye. Whatever. A-C-A...

30
00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.750
Tony Kaizen:
Açaí.

31
00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:14.150
Malik:
Them bowls.

32
00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:15.150
Tony Kaizen:
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I got you.

33
00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.900
Malik:
I love 'em, bro. It's my guilty pleasure right there.

34
00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:22.130
Tony Kaizen:
Okay, but let's say.. How often are you going out to eat?
Like eating fast food or something like that?

35
00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:26.990
Malik:
Ah, to be honest with you, I'm more of like a, a social
eater, so I don't really go out to eat unless someone wants

36
00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:32.230
to go... or unless someone wants hibachi or sushi, I love
that. If it ain't hibachi or sushi... Yeah, I love that,

37
00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:32.300
though.

38
00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:32.840
Tony Kaizen:
Okay.

39
00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:34.750
Malik:
But if it's not that, then I really don't care to go out to
eat.

40
00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:40.010
Tony Kaizen:
Where does the desire to be like such a healthy person comes
from? You're working out right now when we stopped you,

41
00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:41.150
you're eating super healthy all the time.

42
00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:46.380
Malik:
I ain't gonna hold you. I used to be big as hell, bro. I
used to be like 300. So I have two big brothers and they're

43
00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:50.740
personal trainers so right now I weigh 225, so I dropped
from 300 to 225.

44
00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:52.270
Tony Kaizen:
In what time period?

45
00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:53.160
Malik:
Like a year and a half.

46
00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:54.240
Tony Kaizen:
Oh, shit. Okay.

47
00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:59.230
Malik:
Yeah, so now it's more of like a lifestyle for me, you know
what I'm saying? I just...it's not that I'm just scared to

48
00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:03.510
go back to being...yeah, it is...I'm scared of going back to
being fat, but I'm just...I just have to be healthy, you

49
00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:08.750
know what I'm saying? It's better. I tore my ACL three times
too playing sports when I was that big. Now I still play

50
00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:10.860
sports and I don't have any issues or problems at all.

51
00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:11.750
Tony Kaizen:
Yeah. Okay.

52
00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:12.570
Malik:
Better lifestyle, period.

53
00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:14.710
Tony Kaizen:
So you don't have like a particular weight goal, nothing
like that?

54
00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:23.080
Malik:
Man, nah. At first when I was 300, it was 275, then it was
250, then it was 235. And then, I went all the way to 208. I

55
00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:30.300
started lifting, just eating, bullshit. And then...but now
I'm at 225. So that was just more of like a, a look more

56
00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:30.750
than a weight.

57
00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:35.610
Tony Kaizen:
Okay, okay. So after you go to work, when you get home,
like, what's the rest of your evening typically look like?

58
00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:41.120
Malik:
Sometimes if I work in the... well, I typically try to like,
run and lift in the morning, but I don't do that. So I lift

59
00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:46.320
this morning. So I'm running right now, try to get miles and
so...um, I'm competitive. So me and my friends, we try to do

60
00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:48.290
like 60-mile month challenges.

61
00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:48.890
Tony Kaizen:
Oh, month.

62
00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:53.960
Malik:
So every...so every day, I try to do a little bit of miles.
I mean, twenty miles a day. So I can equal like my sixty

63
00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:57.690
(to) try to beat them (at the end of) the month. So that
kind of keeps me...like I'm going to work out anyway, but it

64
00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:02.290
keeps me competitive and just keep me going...even if, like
today, I really want to come out here. But I gotta beat

65
00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:03.270
them, you know what I'm saying? So...

66
00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:03.810
Tony Kaizen:
That's nice!

67
00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:05.410
Malik:
...that keeps me going. Yeah. Competition.

68
00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:09.280
Tony Kaizen:
Yeah, man. Alright, so switching gears a little bit, what
are some of your pet peeves?

69
00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:18.900
Malik:
Uh, I hate people who...too loud. People who are too loud.
People...if we go out to eat and they smack. I don't like

70
00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:19.170
that.

71
00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:22.140
Tony Kaizen:
What is "smacking", just in case people don't know what that
is? Can you tell us what...

72
00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:24.240
Malik:
You see I got this gum? *Smack* *smack* *smack* I hate that!

73
00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:24.790
Tony Kaizen:
Smackin'.

74
00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:29.130
Malik:
Yes. That's smackin'. I can't stand that. Especially if we
out somewhere. You know, you're smackin'...I don't want to

75
00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:29.800
see what's in your mouth.

76
00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:31.440
Tony Kaizen:
Right.

77
00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:37.750
Malik:
People that have bad hygiene, I don't like that. Or people
that's just messy. I don't really care for that. I like good

78
00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:39.200
vibes. You know what I'm saying? Peace.

79
00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:45.460
Tony Kaizen:
Hmm, okay, I dig it. Now, we out here asking people for
advice as well. So if you could give me a piece of advice

80
00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:48.480
about anything, nothing specific, what advice would you give
me?

81
00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:54.780
Malik:
Elevating yourself. You know, no matter what you do, who you
are, a little bit of progress is better than none at all.

82
00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:59.460
You know what I'm saying? Set little goals that lead to big
goals that lead to wherever you want to go, to try to

83
00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:04.600
succeed in life. I don't know what everybody's goals is but
I mean, that was mine. So every Sunday, you know I'll

84
00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:09.410
write...I'll write goals out for the week and them goals,
you know what I'm saying, lead to monthly goals or lead to

85
00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:12.030
bigger goals. I try to live my life like that every day.

86
00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:17.120
Tony Kaizen:
So basically, whatever the goal is, no matter how big, just
try to break it down into smaller pieces and attack it that

87
00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:17.250
way?

88
00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:18.070
Malik:
Yeah, correct.

89
00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:19.300
Tony Kaizen:
I dig it, I dig it.

90
00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:24.470
Malik:
Just to be successful in life, you know, just...and be the
best person that you can be, you know what I'm saying?

91
00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:25.930
Whatever you want to do, no matter what it is.

92
00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:29.530
Tony Kaizen:
Where did you get that methodology from? Have you always
approached it that way or did somebody teach you that?

93
00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:36.210
Malik:
I have three degrees, so two of my degrees is sociology. So
being around people and learning how they are and being

94
00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:41.440
raised in Brooklyn, it wasn't like that all the time and all
my friends didn't have proper guidance. So it was just kind

95
00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:47.160
of wild out there. It really is. You know what I'm saying?
So um, I moved...so moving to different states and then just

96
00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:52.940
seeing how different people are. I like to help people.
Yeah, I like to make sure someone can uplift each other. You

97
00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:57.410
know, I'm a part of a fraternity, too, and uplifting is
one...one thing that we're really, really big on.

98
00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:00.030
Tony Kaizen:
And for anybody listening, what is a fraternity?

99
00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:07.570
Malik:
Ah, a fraternity is really like a social group. I'm part
of...I'm part of Omega Psi Phi Fraternity, Inc. So one of

100
00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:14.280
our biggest things is uplifting...uplift each other, but it
really is a big brotherhood. So I'm able to connect,

101
00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:21.810
now...like I didn't really grow up with like a lot of people
that were so social or just wanted to help, you know,

102
00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:27.470
everyone just kind of lean on each other, you know, whatever
we need, whatever you want to do, it's a big brotherhood. So

103
00:05:27.470 --> 00:05:32.670
I have big brothers all around the world. I didn't even
know. I could go to any state...if I see, you know, purple

104
00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:38.800
and gold or, you know, anything, you know, representing my
fraternity, then I just know, you know what I'm saying? That

105
00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:41.170
I have a friend, I have a brother. Very uplifting.

106
00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:46.420
Tony Kaizen:
That's what's up, man. Alright, so the last thing I would
like you to do, even though it's a little strange, is if you

107
00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:51.140
could read each of these words one by one, because you know
I teach English or whatever, so for them to hear you

108
00:05:51.140 --> 00:05:52.390
pronounce the words might be helpful.

109
00:05:52.390 --> 00:05:53.650
Malik:
So I'm starting with "literally"?

110
00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:54.900
Tony Kaizen:
Exactly, and just read 'em all...

111
00:05:54.900 --> 00:06:04.430
Malik:
So...literally, schedule, choir, breakfast, vegetable,
rhythm, weird, February, culture, obviously, focus, button,

112
00:06:05.140 --> 00:06:06.730
comfortable, curious, and bottle.

113
00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:09.560
Tony Kaizen:
Thanks a lot, man. Malik, right?

114
00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:09.960
Malik:
Yeah, Malik.

115
00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:10.460
Tony Kaizen:
Appreciate you, man.

116
00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:10.920
Malik:
What's your name, bro?

117
00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:11.260
Tony Kaizen:
I'm Tony.

118
00:06:11.450 --> 00:06:11.700
Malik:
Tony?

119
00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:12.370
Tony Kaizen:
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

120
00:06:12.370 --> 00:06:21.590
Malik:
Nice to meet you!

00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:02.370
Here are four things you need to hear today.

00:00:07.905 --> 00:00:08.655
What's up everybody.

00:00:08.655 --> 00:00:16.005
This is Coffee with Kaizen number 22, and today I'm going to be sharing another thought-provoking clip that I saw online the other day.

00:00:16.425 --> 00:00:24.615
A man named Avi Wizwar, (sorry if I'm pronouncing your name correctly,) is going to share four things that you need to hear today.

00:00:25.005 --> 00:00:30.975
Now, the messages in this clip are extremely important, and I think that they're the perfect thing for you to hear on a Monday morning.

00:00:31.305 --> 00:00:37.080
So like, I always say, we're not going to waste any time we're going to get right into this episode.

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.180
So I'm going to play the clip from, start to finish.

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:43.350
Then I'll explain any words or phrases just to make sure you understand everything.

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:47.670
And after that, I'll share my personal thoughts with you, and that'll be it for this episode.

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:51.339
So let's get into it, my friend.

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:52.320
Let's do this..

00:00:56.425 --> 00:00:58.765
Here are four things you need to hear today.

00:00:59.365 --> 00:01:05.215
Number one, the progress that you make throughout life does not need to be seen or validated by anybody else, but you.

00:01:05.785 --> 00:01:12.085
Understand that the progress that you make and the success that comes with it does not need to be seen or accepted by others.

00:01:12.295 --> 00:01:15.645
It should only be accepted by yourself, and yourself only.

00:01:15.979 --> 00:01:20.780
Number two, you are more than capable of walking away from that situation or that relationship.

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:25.280
The mind games and the toxic activity come to a close when you stop entertaining it.

00:01:25.759 --> 00:01:30.590
Number three, you are with yourself more than anybody else in this life, 24 hours a day.

00:01:30.919 --> 00:01:34.429
Make sure your thoughts and the way you talk to yourself are positive.

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:40.399
Number four, accept people for who they are and how they are, but place them where they may belong.

00:01:40.809 --> 00:01:44.899
Accept all people from all walks of life, it will give you a greater perspective.

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:51.020
But if they do not serve a greater purpose or add positivity to your life, you may leave them where they stand.

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:52.770
All right, y'all.

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:56.149
Hopefully, the clip wasn't too challenging for you to understand.

00:01:56.149 --> 00:02:03.440
But like I said, I'm going to go through and explain any words or phrases that
I think might be a little challenging if you're hearing them for the first time,

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:07.009
just so you understand everything, and then we will proceed.

00:02:07.009 --> 00:02:10.130
So let's go back to thing number one that you need to hear.

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:18.855
Number one, the progress that you make throughout life does not need to be seen or validated by anybody else.

00:02:19.815 --> 00:02:20.144
All right.

00:02:20.144 --> 00:02:25.725
So the progress that you make throughout life does not need to be seen or validated by anybody else.

00:02:25.994 --> 00:02:28.274
So there's a couple of things I want to bring to your attention.

00:02:28.424 --> 00:02:30.435
The first one is the progress.

00:02:30.644 --> 00:02:32.355
He said, the progress that you make.

00:02:32.445 --> 00:02:34.154
So in English we make progress.

00:02:34.154 --> 00:02:37.394
We don't do progress or anything else like that.

00:02:37.394 --> 00:02:38.415
We make progress.

00:02:38.415 --> 00:02:41.925
Now there are also times where you can say, "I'm seeing progress."

00:02:42.175 --> 00:02:45.015
just like I'm witnessing or observing the progress,

00:02:45.165 --> 00:02:49.065
but in terms of the action, we make progress.

00:02:49.185 --> 00:02:49.545
Okay.

00:02:49.785 --> 00:02:52.335
I'm sure that makes sense or I hope that makes sense to you.

00:02:52.575 --> 00:02:55.695
So after that, he says the progress that you make throughout life.

00:02:55.875 --> 00:03:02.745
Now, I've already made an episode about this on Life in English, about, um, through, throughout though, et cetera.

00:03:02.955 --> 00:03:05.775
So you should know what the word throughout means and how to use it.

00:03:05.775 --> 00:03:07.365
But just in case you haven't heard that episode..

00:03:08.025 --> 00:03:10.245
When he says throughout, in this case,

00:03:10.454 --> 00:03:14.625
T H R O U G H O U T.

00:03:15.345 --> 00:03:16.845
That's a long word, throughout.

00:03:17.025 --> 00:03:20.775
What he's saying is he's referring to the duration of your life.

00:03:20.805 --> 00:03:25.755
So if I say throughout life, I'm talking about the entire duration of your life, from start to finish.

00:03:25.965 --> 00:03:28.965
All that time in between the start and the finish.

00:03:29.025 --> 00:03:29.325
Okay?

00:03:29.505 --> 00:03:34.755
So the progress that you make throughout life does not need to be seen or validated by anyone else.

00:03:34.965 --> 00:03:38.565
So the last thing I want to bring to your attention is validated by.

00:03:38.984 --> 00:03:43.755
Validated just means basically having the value of something confirmed, right?

00:03:43.995 --> 00:03:45.345
That's not the textbook definition.

00:03:45.345 --> 00:03:46.485
I don't have that in front of me,

00:03:46.485 --> 00:03:48.795
but that's the basic idea of the word.

00:03:48.975 --> 00:03:55.005
So when we say validated by anybody else, that's our way of expressing an action being done...

00:03:55.795 --> 00:03:56.244
Not...

00:03:56.774 --> 00:03:59.505
I can't say it in a different way, not by you, but by someone else.

00:03:59.505 --> 00:04:01.755
I really can't find another word to express that.

00:04:01.935 --> 00:04:09.485
So when we say validated by someone else, we don't say validated for someone else or validated with or any other preposition.

00:04:10.484 --> 00:04:13.155
Things are validated by other people.

00:04:14.175 --> 00:04:15.285
Man, I hope that makes sense.

00:04:15.285 --> 00:04:19.815
But now let's get into my own personal thoughts and opinions about this first...

00:04:20.555 --> 00:04:26.910
I don't know if it's a tip, but this idea, this thing that we really need to hear, not just today, but on a regular basis, right?

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:35.790
This one is important because for better or for worse, it has become common practice to share every moment of every day of our lives with the world.

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:40.140
"If I don't share it online, then it didn't really happen."

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:43.770
That's the mentality that a lot of people have adopted these days.

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:50.219
And the truth is not only do most people not give a single fuck about you or your life experience,

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:52.890
but most people don't want to see you succeed anyway.

00:04:54.239 --> 00:05:04.169
Progress, success, and greatness threaten the fragile egos of the people who
are fully aware that they're not doing anything productive with their own lives.

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:08.789
When they see you trying to do better or even just do something different,

00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:15.000
their natural instinct will be to try and tear you down, criticize you and make you feel insecure.

00:05:16.229 --> 00:05:26.039
So, although you may feel the urge to share your growth, your light, your positivity with others, just remember that you are not for everyone.

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:34.950
Your highs and lows are personal experiences, and you certainly should not be getting personal with anyone and everyone you meet.

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:39.880
Your daily struggle is just that yours.

00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:44.030
And it doesn't need to be shared with the world in order for it to be validated.

00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:47.750
So, number two.

00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:53.930
Number two, you are more than capable of walking away from that situation or that relationship.

00:05:54.110 --> 00:05:58.830
The mind games and the toxic activity come to a close when you stop entertaining it.

00:06:00.780 --> 00:06:02.340
So I'm just going to repeat what he said.

00:06:02.490 --> 00:06:06.690
You are more than capable of walking away from that situation or that relationship.

00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:11.800
The mind games and the toxic activity come to a close when you stop entertaining it.

00:06:12.525 --> 00:06:15.854
So the first thing I want to explain is more than capable,

00:06:16.305 --> 00:06:18.854
'cause capable in this case is functioning like an adjective, right?

00:06:18.854 --> 00:06:19.815
You are capable.

00:06:20.145 --> 00:06:29.174
So when we say more than capable, that's our way of expressing that you have this capacity for something and then some.

00:06:29.445 --> 00:06:35.625
So let's say you need five points to be considered capable, but you have 50 points.

00:06:35.775 --> 00:06:37.275
So you are more than capable.

00:06:37.275 --> 00:06:43.215
You have more than what is necessary to do or to say this particular thing.

00:06:43.395 --> 00:06:44.565
That's our way of expressing that.

00:06:44.745 --> 00:06:49.094
You are more than capable of walking away from that situation or that relationship.

00:06:49.245 --> 00:06:51.015
You have more than what is necessary.

00:06:51.494 --> 00:06:51.804
You see?

00:06:52.545 --> 00:06:54.645
So, next is walking away from,

00:06:55.125 --> 00:07:00.795
I believe I talked about this in the last episode, but to walk away from, in this context, is more of a figurative thing.

00:07:00.974 --> 00:07:06.825
To walk away from a situation or a relationship basically means to leave it behind, leave it in the past.

00:07:07.045 --> 00:07:12.044
It's no longer your concern or your responsibility is not getting your attention or importance anymore.

00:07:12.194 --> 00:07:18.164
You have walked away from it, the same way you would physically walk away from something that you did not want to be close to anymore.

00:07:18.495 --> 00:07:19.185
That's the idea.

00:07:19.725 --> 00:07:20.025
All right.

00:07:20.175 --> 00:07:23.625
So the mind games and the toxic activity come to a close.

00:07:23.925 --> 00:07:25.605
The first thing, mind games.

00:07:25.815 --> 00:07:29.745
This, maybe you can understand this just by hearing it, but when we say mind games,

00:07:29.775 --> 00:07:35.895
it's the psychological games that people try to play with you in order to manipulate you.

00:07:35.985 --> 00:07:36.855
That's a mind game.

00:07:36.855 --> 00:07:41.505
Something that they're doing, they have some psychological tactic to get inside your head

00:07:42.135 --> 00:07:44.715
and do what they want you to do, or think what they want you to think.

00:07:45.870 --> 00:07:52.830
Now the toxic activity, I'm sure you've heard the word toxic, you know, over the last year, maybe two.

00:07:52.830 --> 00:07:55.710
It's become a really popular word, even though it's overused.

00:07:55.950 --> 00:07:57.390
Toxic activity is just...

00:07:58.770 --> 00:08:01.260
toxic is something that is just not good for you.

00:08:01.349 --> 00:08:02.490
Think of it as poison.

00:08:02.979 --> 00:08:03.900
Poison is toxic.

00:08:03.900 --> 00:08:04.500
It can kill you.

00:08:04.710 --> 00:08:11.010
So any toxic chemical or material is something that can or has the ability to kill you.

00:08:11.070 --> 00:08:12.030
Can potentially kill you.

00:08:12.030 --> 00:08:15.900
So toxic activity is just shit that is not good for your mental health.

00:08:15.930 --> 00:08:17.370
It's not good for your physical health.

00:08:17.400 --> 00:08:19.800
It's waste of time, makes you miserable.

00:08:20.010 --> 00:08:21.150
That's toxic activity.

00:08:21.200 --> 00:08:22.650
Shit that's just really not good for you.

00:08:23.130 --> 00:08:28.140
So the mind games and the toxic activity come to a close when you stop entertaining them.

00:08:28.289 --> 00:08:29.969
So to come to a close.

00:08:30.360 --> 00:08:33.990
What he means when he said, when he says that is it ends.

00:08:34.020 --> 00:08:36.659
If something comes to a close, that means it comes to an end.

00:08:36.900 --> 00:08:37.579
It finishes.

00:08:37.849 --> 00:08:38.459
It's over.

00:08:38.959 --> 00:08:39.120
Okay.

00:08:39.120 --> 00:08:43.135
It's kind of a formal way of saying to end or to finish, right?

00:08:43.155 --> 00:08:44.625
The movie has come to a close.

00:08:45.015 --> 00:08:47.535
I'm almost certain, we would never say that, but it does make sense.

00:08:47.535 --> 00:08:48.915
It just means the movie has ended.

00:08:48.915 --> 00:08:50.415
The story has come to a close.

00:08:50.685 --> 00:08:56.099
The games, the toxic activity come to a close, they end when you stop entertaining them.

00:08:56.310 --> 00:09:01.589
So to entertain in this context, doesn't mean to make somebody laugh and make them have a good time.

00:09:01.589 --> 00:09:04.170
That's one way of saying, or using the word entertain.

00:09:04.560 --> 00:09:13.199
But in this case to entertain an idea or a person or an activity means to give it a chance to entertain you, right?

00:09:13.199 --> 00:09:16.500
You're giving it time and attention and energy and focus.

00:09:16.530 --> 00:09:17.560
You're entertaining it.

00:09:18.209 --> 00:09:22.485
It's probably not the best explanation of the word, so I just found the definition in the dictionary.

00:09:22.485 --> 00:09:29.295
And to entertain in this context is to give attention or consideration to an idea, a suggestion or a feeling.

00:09:29.295 --> 00:09:30.645
And I would also say a person.

00:09:30.795 --> 00:09:31.005
Okay.

00:09:31.005 --> 00:09:33.105
So it just means to give attention or consideration to.

00:09:33.405 --> 00:09:34.005
That's the idea.

00:09:34.005 --> 00:09:41.385
So when you stop doing that, giving attention and consideration to toxic activity, to mind games, to manipulative people,

00:09:42.195 --> 00:09:43.335
all that shit comes to an end.

00:09:43.905 --> 00:09:44.595
That's the idea.

00:09:45.285 --> 00:09:47.084
And this one really is about self-respect.

00:09:47.670 --> 00:09:54.180
You know, you might be surprised by how much time you waste on people and situations that aren't bringing any real value to your life.

00:09:55.050 --> 00:10:01.290
You might be ashamed of yourself if you took a step back to really see how much energy, attention, and importance

00:10:01.290 --> 00:10:08.400
you're giving to people who want nothing more than to manipulate you, play games with you and use you like a tool or a child's toy.

00:10:10.050 --> 00:10:15.390
You'll see a real positive change in your life once you gain the self-respect and courage, you must have

00:10:16.229 --> 00:10:19.859
in order to walk away from people and things that don't serve your life purpose.

00:10:20.670 --> 00:10:25.650
But here's the catch, you must decide what your life purpose actually is.

00:10:26.790 --> 00:10:31.050
Only then can you decide if the people and things in your life are serving that purpose or not.

00:10:32.369 --> 00:10:39.699
You must also take the time to get to know yourself, get comfortable with yourself and get comfortable with the idea of being alone.

00:10:41.255 --> 00:10:45.335
If you can't do these things, it's likely that you'll keep going back to the same shitty people

00:10:45.605 --> 00:10:48.305
and or attracting more people of the same kind.

00:10:49.655 --> 00:10:53.825
So stop entertaining people's bullshit and watch your life change for the better.

00:10:56.275 --> 00:10:56.755
Number three.

00:10:58.615 --> 00:11:03.415
Number three, you are with yourself more than anybody else in this life, 24 hours a day.

00:11:03.775 --> 00:11:07.315
Make sure your thoughts and the way you talk to yourself are positive.

00:11:09.445 --> 00:11:14.095
You are with yourself more than anybody else in his life, 24 hours a day.

00:11:15.025 --> 00:11:18.595
Make sure your thoughts and the way you talk to yourself are positive.

00:11:19.565 --> 00:11:22.285
Now, remember when I said you must get comfortable with yourself.

00:11:23.425 --> 00:11:24.475
This is what I was talking about.

00:11:25.585 --> 00:11:30.415
Understand that the only person that will be with you from the day you were born until the day you die.

00:11:33.025 --> 00:11:38.455
That's the person that should get the most love, attention, nourishment and energy in your life.

00:11:39.225 --> 00:11:40.495
Now, do not misunderstand me.

00:11:41.185 --> 00:11:43.495
I'm not saying that you shouldn't be hard on yourself.

00:11:44.935 --> 00:11:49.585
Part of true love and compassion is doing and saying the things that are difficult and uncomfortable.

00:11:50.245 --> 00:11:55.225
So if you're a piece of shit, you have to be able to look in the mirror and recognize that.

00:11:56.305 --> 00:12:00.315
If you can't do that, you won't ever be able to change it and become something better.

00:12:01.545 --> 00:12:03.510
So this isn't about that fake self-love.

00:12:03.709 --> 00:12:07.849
This isn't about only saying positive things that make you feel better.

00:12:08.750 --> 00:12:17.420
This is about acknowledging your flaws, your mistakes, your insecurities, your hatred, your weakness, all the negativity and shortcomings.

00:12:18.349 --> 00:12:19.910
You must acknowledge all of it.

00:12:20.240 --> 00:12:27.639
And then you must focus 100% of your energy on improving thosethings every single day..

00:12:28.860 --> 00:12:34.440
So don't tear yourself down with negativity, but acknowledge the negativity that is inside you.

00:12:35.580 --> 00:12:43.470
And don't build yourself up with false positivity, but take the actions that will prove that your intentions and direction are positive.

00:12:44.730 --> 00:12:47.690
That's how you get on the road to a better version of yourself.

00:12:49.980 --> 00:12:50.550
Number four.

00:12:53.120 --> 00:12:59.305
Number four, accept people for who they are and how they are, but place them where they may belong.

00:12:59.745 --> 00:13:03.834
Accept all people from all walks of life, it will give you a greater perspective.

00:13:04.074 --> 00:13:09.895
But if they do not serve a greater purpose or add positivity to your life, you may leave them where they stand.

00:13:12.775 --> 00:13:13.194
All right.

00:13:13.474 --> 00:13:17.275
Accept people for who they are and how they are, but place them where they belong.

00:13:17.454 --> 00:13:19.514
So what he means when he says that is...

00:13:20.534 --> 00:13:24.479
Well, the part about accepting people for who they are and how they are is pretty clear, I imagine.

00:13:24.719 --> 00:13:29.189
But place them where they belong simply means to put them in the right place.

00:13:29.520 --> 00:13:31.329
You know, that place might be close to you,

00:13:31.694 --> 00:13:33.615
that place might be very far away from you,

00:13:33.615 --> 00:13:35.474
but you need to put them in the right place.

00:13:35.564 --> 00:13:35.865
All right?

00:13:36.255 --> 00:13:38.685
Now, accept people from all walks of life.

00:13:38.925 --> 00:13:42.495
This is an expression that just describes people from different backgrounds.

00:13:42.525 --> 00:13:46.275
It could be religious backgrounds, cultural backgrounds, ethnic backgrounds.

00:13:46.275 --> 00:13:46.905
It doesn't matter.

00:13:47.084 --> 00:13:50.025
If it's a man or a woman, they're black, white, brown, yellow.

00:13:50.295 --> 00:13:51.194
It doesn't matter.

00:13:51.224 --> 00:13:52.844
All these people come from different places.

00:13:52.844 --> 00:13:55.665
They speak different languages, have different beliefs and things like that.

00:13:56.375 --> 00:14:01.865
They all have a different or come from a different walk of life and you need to be able to accept all of them.

00:14:02.225 --> 00:14:02.885
That's the idea.

00:14:03.065 --> 00:14:10.685
Because that will give you a greater perspective and greater perspective just means bigger, more clear, a wider perspective, right?

00:14:10.835 --> 00:14:14.045
As opposed to a narrow, closed-minded view of the world,

00:14:14.675 --> 00:14:16.745
by accepting people from all walks of life,

00:14:17.075 --> 00:14:22.094
you are widening or making your perspective greater, bigger, right?

00:14:22.405 --> 00:14:23.040
That's the idea.

00:14:23.670 --> 00:14:29.939
However, if they do not serve a greater purpose or add positivity to your life, you may leave them where they stand.

00:14:30.180 --> 00:14:33.120
So the last thing I want to explain is serve a greater purpose.

00:14:33.449 --> 00:14:35.910
We've been talking about that basically this whole episode.

00:14:36.180 --> 00:14:39.750
So if something serves a greater purpose, basically what we're saying is,

00:14:40.380 --> 00:14:44.640
it's contributing to that higher purpose that's bigger than yourself.

00:14:44.640 --> 00:14:47.775
Your life's purpose, what you're really trying to achieve in life..

00:14:47.895 --> 00:14:48.945
That's the greater purpose.

00:14:49.095 --> 00:14:55.395
If it's not serving that, or if this person is not serving that greater purpose, you may leave them where they stand.

00:14:55.725 --> 00:14:58.485
Leave them behind, leave them to the side, in the past.

00:14:58.635 --> 00:15:00.165
You do not need to take them with you.

00:15:00.165 --> 00:15:02.025
There's no obligation to do that.

00:15:03.045 --> 00:15:05.475
The way I understood his message, that's the idea.

00:15:05.865 --> 00:15:06.195
You know?

00:15:06.615 --> 00:15:13.245
And as a young man, I've gone through different stages of understanding when it comes to this particular subject.

00:15:14.565 --> 00:15:16.385
I really used to think that I could change people.

00:15:17.235 --> 00:15:23.010
And I never had the idea in my mind to change someone, but I subconsciously believed it was possible.

00:15:23.790 --> 00:15:30.210
However, believing in an idea like that only brings frustration and disappointment.

00:15:31.540 --> 00:15:35.550
Although I do believe you can influence people, you can never change them.

00:15:36.720 --> 00:15:40.260
Change is an action that the individual must choose to take.

00:15:40.260 --> 00:15:42.150
And once you understand that,

00:15:42.420 --> 00:15:50.400
you'll stop investing time and energy into people who clearly show no intention of investing time and energy into themselves.

00:15:51.750 --> 00:15:55.800
We must also acknowledge the fact that the idea that you can change someone else

00:15:56.050 --> 00:16:00.510
suggests that you know exactly what is wrong with the person and you know exactly how to fix it.

00:16:01.650 --> 00:16:04.780
However, that's simply not the case and it never will be.

00:16:06.080 --> 00:16:10.490
You most likely don't even know what's wrong with yourself or how you're going to make yourself better.

00:16:11.510 --> 00:16:16.130
So what makes you think that you know everything about someone else and how to make them better?

00:16:17.890 --> 00:16:21.670
Clean your own room before you talk about how dirty someone else's room is.

00:16:23.670 --> 00:16:28.530
After realizing I couldn't change people, I started to think that if I just waited long enough,

00:16:29.100 --> 00:16:30.360
people would change on their own.

00:16:31.740 --> 00:16:33.070
"People just need time."

00:16:33.300 --> 00:16:33.720
I thought.

00:16:35.050 --> 00:16:43.220
Although I do believe that change takes time, I do not think it is wise to spend your time waiting for someone or something else to change.

00:16:44.390 --> 00:16:46.850
That's something you virtually have no control over.

00:16:47.870 --> 00:16:55.340
So while you're sitting there waiting for another person to change, the minutes, the hours and the days of your life are passing by.

00:16:56.870 --> 00:16:59.360
Are you sure you want to spend that time waiting for someone else?

00:17:01.974 --> 00:17:07.825
Once I came to this realization, that you can either change someone nor spend your life waiting for them to change,

00:17:08.395 --> 00:17:09.835
I arrived at the place I am today.

00:17:11.155 --> 00:17:12.685
I do not judge people for who they are.

00:17:13.645 --> 00:17:15.444
I do not trying to change who they are.

00:17:16.524 --> 00:17:18.085
I'm nothing more than an observer.

00:17:19.615 --> 00:17:25.254
So if you do not try to influence people's thoughts or decisions, and you simply allow them to show you who they are,

00:17:25.944 --> 00:17:28.385
you maintain the power of pure choice.

00:17:29.305 --> 00:17:30.260
What do I mean by that?

00:17:31.190 --> 00:17:38.180
I mean that you can make a truly informed decision about this person because you haven't done anything to influence or change their behavior.

00:17:39.260 --> 00:17:45.050
You can decide whether or not this person would be a good addition to your life or if they just be a waste of time and energy,

00:17:45.680 --> 00:17:51.050
and you can make that informed decision because you have done nothing more than let them be themselves.

00:17:51.950 --> 00:17:57.110
No judgment, no influence, no criticism, just observation.

00:17:58.850 --> 00:18:03.050
So be accepting of all people, within reason, of course.

00:18:03.980 --> 00:18:11.120
However, remember that accepting someone for who they are is not the same thing as giving them a place of importance in your life.

00:18:12.290 --> 00:18:14.370
Sometimes you got to love people from a distance.

00:18:16.120 --> 00:18:24.240
Remember that you always have the right and sometimes even the obligation to
walk away from people or situations that don't serve you or your life's purpose.

00:18:25.350 --> 00:18:30.750
Remember that your time is better spent on improving yourself and living your life's purpose.

00:18:32.340 --> 00:18:35.639
Each person and situation in our life is simply an experience.

00:18:36.540 --> 00:18:41.250
The purpose of an experience is to teach us something and it's our responsibility to learn.

00:18:42.540 --> 00:18:46.162
If you're not learning from your experiences, you're simply wasting time.

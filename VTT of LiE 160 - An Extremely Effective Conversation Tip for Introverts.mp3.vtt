00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:05.910
What's up, my friend? You already know this is the Life in
English podcast. I am your host, Tony Kaizen, and today's

2
00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:11.360
episode is for the introverts out there, the people who
struggle to express themselves and maintain conversations

3
00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:17.340
with strangers in social situations. Now you might think of
your introverted personality as a weakness or a

4
00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:23.020
disadvantage, but the reality is that you've got a
communication superpower and you don't even know it, my

5
00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:31.060
friend. In my experience, introverts have a tendency to
watch and listen more than they speak when interacting with

6
00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:37.800
strangers. This means that introverts have a tendency to
notice and perceive things that others cannot. And as an

7
00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:45.170
introvert, you can use the observations you make as
conversation starters, jokes, arguments, reflections, all

8
00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:51.890
kinds of stuff. You just need to understand the art of
communication and practice consistently. Now, personally,

9
00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:57.090
I'm learning new things about communication skills every
day, and one of the things I love most is sharing the things

10
00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:04.390
I've learned with you. I'm gonna help you become a better
communicator because communication is at the heart of every

11
00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:10.780
single thing we do in life. So we're going to develop your
communication skills because you don't care about English,

12
00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:18.770
right? What you really care about is what you can do with
English. You can get a better job, make more money, support

13
00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:27.740
your family, travel the world, make new friends. All of that
is obtained through proper communication skills. English is

14
00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:35.190
just a tool we use to communicate. If the entire world were
learning Spanish instead of English, then the name of this

15
00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:43.570
podcast would be La Vida en EspaÃ±ol, and I'd be saying the
same exact thing in Spanish. Develop your communication

16
00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:46.060
skills. That's it.

17
00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:53.140
But enough of the lecture. I told you that I got a
conversation tip for introverts and that simple tip is to

18
00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:59.760
use your attentive listening skills to encourage other
people to talk about themselves and their experiences. I was

19
00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:05.440
reading the book How to Win Friends and Influence People by
Dale Carnegie, and I came across a chapter titled An Easy

20
00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:10.650
Way to Become a Good Conversationalist. Now, I'm going to
read two passages from this chapter and explain the

21
00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:16.290
fundamental concepts that you can experiment with in your
next conversation. But before I do that, I want to make it

22
00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:21.530
clear that I don't mean to say all introverts are great
listeners, because they certainly are not, and not all

23
00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:27.990
extroverts are poor listeners. I'm just saying that most
introverts spend more time listening than talking, and the

24
00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:34.900
opposite is true for extroverts. But this information can
and should be applied by introverts and extroverts alike. In

25
00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:41.070
fact, if you're an extrovert and you wanna get closer to an
introvert, you should listen closely to this episode and try

26
00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:46.440
this the next time you speak with him or her. As long as
you're genuine in your approach, you might be pleasantly

27
00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:53.140
surprised by the results. But anyway, my friend, it's about
time to get this show on the motherfucking road. So I'm

28
00:02:53.140 --> 00:03:02.670
going to read the first passage to you now. Passage number
one. "Some time ago, I attended a bridge party.

29
00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:09.830
I don't play bridge. And there was a woman there who didn't
play bridge either. She had discovered that I had once been

30
00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:15.060
Lowell Thomas' manager before he went on the radio, and that
I had traveled in Europe a great deal while helping him

31
00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:22.800
prepare the illustrated travel talks he was then delivering.
So she said, 'Oh, Mr. Carnegie, I do want you to tell me

32
00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:30.470
about the wonderful places you visited and the sights you've
seen.' As we sat down on the sofa, she remarked that she and

33
00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:38.190
her husband had recently returned from a trip to Africa.
'Africa?,' I exclaimed. 'How interesting! I've always wanted

34
00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:44.510
to see Africa, but I never got there, except for a 24-hour
stay in Algiers. Tell me, did you visit the big-game

35
00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:45.850
country? Yes?

36
00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:54.260
How fortunate! I envy you. Do tell me about Africa.' That
kept her talking for 45 minutes.

37
00:03:54.990 --> 00:04:00.990
She never again asked me where I had been or what I had
seen. She didn't want to hear me talk about my travels. All

38
00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:08.710
she wanted was an interested listener so she could expand
her ego and tell me about where she had been. Was she

39
00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:11.060
unusual? No.

40
00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:17.530
Many people are like that. For example, I met a
distinguished botanist at a dinner party given by a New York

41
00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:24.970
book publisher. I had never talked with a botanist before,
and I found them fascinating. I literally sat on the edge of

42
00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:30.870
my chair and listened while he spoke of exotic plants and
experiments and developing new forms of plant life and

43
00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:38.640
indoor gardens, and even told me astonishing facts about the
humble potato. I had a small indoor garden of my own. He was

44
00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:45.800
good enough to tell me how to solve some of my problems. As
I said, we were at a dinner party. There must have been a

45
00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:51.830
dozen other guests, but I violated all the canons of
courtesy, ignored everyone else, and talked for hours to the

46
00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:54.760
botanist. Midnight came.

47
00:04:54.760 --> 00:05:01.560
I said goodnight to everyone and departed. The botanist then
turned to our host and paid me several flattering comments.

48
00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:09.900
I was 'most stimulating'. I was this and I was that, and he
ended by saying I was a 'most interesting

49
00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:14.340
conversationalist'. An interesting conversationalist?

50
00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:22.030
Why? I had hardly said anything at all. I couldn't have said
anything if I had wanted to without changing the subject for

51
00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:29.760
I didn't know any more about botany than I knew about the
anatomy of a penguin. But I had done this: I had listened

52
00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:38.670
intently. I had listened because I was genuinely interested
and he felt it. Naturally, that pleased him. That kind of

53
00:05:38.670 --> 00:05:45.760
listening is one of the highest compliments we can pay
anyone." "Few human beings," wrote Jack Woodford in

54
00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:54.290
Strangers in Love, "few human beings are proof against the
implied flattery of rapt attention." I went even further

55
00:05:54.290 --> 00:06:01.590
than giving him rapt attention. I was hearty in my
approbation and lavish in my praise. I told him that I had

56
00:06:01.590 --> 00:06:10.950
been immensely entertained and instructed, and I had. I told
him I wished I had his knowledge, and I did. I told him that

57
00:06:10.950 --> 00:06:19.880
I should love to wander the fields with him, and I have. I
told him I must see him again, and I did. And so I had him

58
00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:25.360
thinking of me as a good conversationalist, when in reality
I had been merely a good listener and had encouraged him to

59
00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:32.770
talk." Alright, my friend.

60
00:06:32.770 --> 00:06:39.400
When I read this passage, I feel like I'm looking in the
mirror. I don't particularly like talking about myself with

61
00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:44.750
people I don't know or trust, and listening is something
that comes naturally to me. And somewhere along the line, I

62
00:06:44.750 --> 00:06:49.670
figured out that you don't have to have a bunch of
interesting things to say about yourself in order to have an

63
00:06:49.670 --> 00:06:56.140
interesting conversation with someone else. You could just
use your natural curiosity to get the other person talking.

64
00:06:57.620 --> 00:07:04.220
And this is a major unlock for introverts who tend to watch
and listen more than they speak. Trying to be social in a

65
00:07:04.220 --> 00:07:11.010
room full of strangers can be very uncomfortable for
introverts who don't enjoy or even know how to make small

66
00:07:11.010 --> 00:07:18.770
talk. But if you develop your communication skills and learn
how to interview people conversationally, you can talk to

67
00:07:18.770 --> 00:07:24.710
just about anyone who's willing to talk to you. You can hear
things that other people don't hear simply because you're

68
00:07:24.710 --> 00:07:30.820
listening attentively. And that means you can take the
conversations to places it never would have gone if it were

69
00:07:30.820 --> 00:07:35.860
just two people talking over each other, fighting for the
spotlight, and filling moments of silence with senseless

70
00:07:35.860 --> 00:07:43.050
chatter. When you encourage people to talk about themselves
and their experiences, and then you show them that you see

71
00:07:43.050 --> 00:07:49.370
where they're coming from, they end up feeling understood. 
And when people feel that you truly understand them, they

72
00:07:49.370 --> 00:07:56.080
feel a deeper connection with you. This is why you hang out
with certain people or buy certain products from certain

73
00:07:56.080 --> 00:08:02.020
brands and listen to certain songs repetitively. You feel
that you understand them and that they understand you,

74
00:08:02.300 --> 00:08:09.570
right? Or at least I think that's the reason. But my point
is, that seeking to learn about and understand other people

75
00:08:09.570 --> 00:08:15.860
will inevitably bring you closer to them, which creates a
deeper connection and a stronger affinity for you. But

76
00:08:15.860 --> 00:08:21.520
here's the catch: the interest you show must be genuine.

77
00:08:23.070 --> 00:08:29.020
People can smell fake interest from a mile away, bro. So if
you're thinking about using the tactic to manipulate

78
00:08:29.020 --> 00:08:38.860
people's perceptions or feeling towards you, I'm telling you
now, it'll only backfire. So, let's get on to

79
00:08:38.860 --> 00:08:47.900
passage number two. "One of the great listeners of modern
times was Sigmund Freud.

80
00:08:48.970 --> 00:08:56.570
A man who met Freud described his manner of listening. 'It
struck me so forcibly that I shall never forget him. He had

81
00:08:56.570 --> 00:09:04.340
qualities which I had never seen in any other man. Never had
I seen such concentrated attention. There was none of the

82
00:09:04.740 --> 00:09:13.790
piercing soul-penetrating gaze business. His eyes were mild
and genial. His voice was low and kind. His gestures were

83
00:09:13.790 --> 00:09:23.110
few. But the attention he gave me, his appreciation of what
I said, even when I said it badly, was extraordinary. You

84
00:09:23.110 --> 00:09:31.380
have no idea what it meant to be listened to like that.' If
you want to know how to make people shun you and laugh at

85
00:09:31.380 --> 00:09:39.820
you behind your back or even despise you, here's the recipe:
Never listen to anyone for long. Talk incessantly about

86
00:09:39.820 --> 00:09:45.510
yourself. If you have an idea while the other person is
talking, don't wait for him or her to finish. Bust right in

87
00:09:45.510 --> 00:09:53.650
and interrupt in the middle of a sentence. Do you know
people like that? I do, unfortunately.

88
00:09:54.210 --> 00:10:03.440
And the astonishing part of it is that some of them are
prominent. Bores, that is all they are - bores intoxicated

89
00:10:03.440 --> 00:10:10.700
with their own egos, drunk with the sense of their own
importance. People who talk only of themselves think only of

90
00:10:10.700 --> 00:10:18.650
themselves. And those people who think only of themselves
are hopelessly uneducated. They are not educated, no matter

91
00:10:18.650 --> 00:10:27.670
how instructed they may be. So if you aspire to be a good
conversationalist, be an attentive listener. To be

92
00:10:27.670 --> 00:10:29.940
interesting, be interested.

93
00:10:30.980 --> 00:10:36.370
Ask questions that other people will enjoy answering.
Encourage them to talk about themselves and their

94
00:10:36.370 --> 00:10:43.560
accomplishments. Remember that the people you are talking to
are a hundred times more interested in themselves and their

95
00:10:43.560 --> 00:10:51.620
wants and problems than they are in you and your problems. A
person's toothache means more to that person than a famine

96
00:10:51.620 --> 00:11:01.170
in China which kills a million people. A boil on one's neck
interests one more than 40 earthquakes in Africa. Think

97
00:11:01.170 --> 00:11:09.160
about that the next time you start a conversation." Alright,
my friend.

98
00:11:09.470 --> 00:11:14.750
Personally, I don't think this passage needs much
summarizing, but I will reiterate the fact that attentive

99
00:11:14.750 --> 00:11:21.540
listening skills are a superpower that should never be
underestimated. You might have been led to believe that

100
00:11:21.540 --> 00:11:26.790
talking about yourself and trying to make yourself look good
was the way to make people like you. But I can tell you that

101
00:11:27.270 --> 00:11:33.660
it's really the exact opposite. If you don't believe me,
just start paying more attention. Start listening to the

102
00:11:33.660 --> 00:11:40.980
conversations happening around you. Pay attention to what's
actually being said. I think you'll realize that a lot of

103
00:11:40.980 --> 00:11:46.220
people aren't listening to each other at all. They're just
on a marketing campaign trying to sell the world on the idea

104
00:11:46.220 --> 00:11:53.230
that they're cool, interesting, powerful, respected,
beautiful, funny, different, or whatever bullshit. It's just

105
00:11:53.230 --> 00:11:55.290
"me, me, me.

106
00:11:55.520 --> 00:11:58.440
Me, me, me, me, me, me, me!" Right?

107
00:12:00.600 --> 00:12:10.280
What on earth could be more boring than that? If you want to
have better conversations, be a good listener. Encourage

108
00:12:10.320 --> 00:12:11.950
others to talk about themselves.

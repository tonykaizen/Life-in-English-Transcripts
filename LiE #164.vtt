00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:07.410
What's up, my friend? You already know this is the Life in
English podcast. I am your host, Tony Kaizen, and man, I was

2
00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:13.960
just sitting here reflecting on a conversation I had not too
long ago, and it made me think about something that we call

3
00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:20.480
"knee-jerk reactions". A knee-jerk reaction is something
that...it's like this type of reaction that you have

4
00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:26.300
instinctively; you don't even think about it. So if somebody
says something to you or does something to you or you see

5
00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:31.630
something or whatever, just boom! Instantly, without
thinking about it, you react in some kind of way. Maybe you

6
00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:37.450
immediately say something or do something, you know,
reacting to whatever has happened or whatever was said to

7
00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:42.380
you. And I'm not sure exactly where this comes from, but
when I hear it, it makes me think of when you go to the

8
00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:50.740
doctor and you sit on the uh...the bed, I guess you would
call it, and the doctor tests your reflexes, right? That

9
00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:57.400
little silicone hammer that they use, and they'll start
testing all your reflexes and they'll *bam*...hit you on the

10
00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:04.630
kneecap or right under your kneecap, I guess, and your leg
will *whoosh*...just instinctively move. It reacts without

11
00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:11.040
you having to do anything. It does it involuntarily, just
*bam*, your knee jerks. It makes a jerking motion, a very

12
00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:14.730
swift change of position or location.

13
00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:20.570
Hopefully you get the idea of what I'm trying to say. That's
a knee-jerk react or that's like knee...That's when your

14
00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:26.320
knee is jerking what I just describe it at the doctor's
office. So when you think about that in the term of

15
00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:32.910
um...when you think about that in the case of life or
situations, it's just those moments when somebody hits the

16
00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:38.580
right button or says the right thing or just does something
that makes you *tsss*, immediately just react without

17
00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:44.910
thinking about it. That's a knee-jerk reaction. Now, the
reason I explained all that is because sometimes we have

18
00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:50.410
knee-jerk reactions during conversations. You might be
talking to somebody and a lot of people who are really

19
00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:56.240
excited to talk or share what they think or they're so
deeply involved with what they think and feel and their

20
00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:03.460
opinions, even when they're not the ones that are speaking
but they have a tendency to do is listen only with the

21
00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:09.240
intention of responding. And as soon as a response pops into
their mind, they feel compelled to say it. It doesn't matter

22
00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:15.090
if the other person is still speaking. It doesn't matter if
the other person has made their point clear yet or anything

23
00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:21.100
like that. It's just the listener in this case who's so
excited to talk just wants to share what they have to say.

24
00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:26.860
The thought bubbles up into their mind and bam! "I have to
say it, I have to say it!" It's this knee-jerk reaction,just

25
00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:32.510
instinctively. You see what I'm saying? It's almost as if
some people, when they're listening, we all do this from

26
00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:39.640
time to time; you'll be listening to somebody and it's like
they say this certain thing in a certain way or whatever it

27
00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:45.250
is, and immediately you've already made your mind up. In
other words, you've already decided what it is you think,

28
00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:50.650
what it is you're going to say or what it is you're going to
do. The person hasn't even finished making their point yet,

29
00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:55.980
but you've already made up your mind. So you just start
talking and you let them know you've made your mind up and

30
00:02:55.980 --> 00:03:01.860
you disagree or...or you totally agree and you can relate,
and you've been through that too. You just have to voice

31
00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:07.680
your opinions and thoughts, right? It's a knee-jerk
reaction. And in the past, I used to think people were just

32
00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:14.990
like assholes, or ignorant or rude or disrespectful for
cutting me off and talking over me and, you know, not giving

33
00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:20.750
me the time and space to express myself. But what I found is
in a lot of cases, man, people are not doing it because they

34
00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:26.230
want to be rude or don't like, value what you had to say.
It's just they're so much more in tune with what they have

35
00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:31.830
to say than they are with what you're trying to say. And
that doesn't make them a bad person or rude or an asshole or

36
00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:38.020
nothing like that. They're just not aware of this knee-jerk
reaction that they have to talk over people to get their

37
00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:42.870
word, and to express themselves, when maybe it would be
better if they just like, learn how to listen a little bit

38
00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:50.390
more, or bring somebody else into the conversation, you
know, to...to kind of like be involved in the true dance

39
00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:56.790
that is communication or a conversation, you know what I
mean? And it's just something to be aware of because you

40
00:03:56.790 --> 00:04:01.870
might do this all the time and maybe nobody's ever brought
it to your attention, you know? It can really, really,

41
00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:08.630
really serve you well when you slow down a little bit and
choose to wait until the other person has finished speaking,

42
00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:16.190
or at least wait until they've truly made their point, then
think about what they said and then respond. It'll serve you

43
00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:21.630
in so many ways, man, because you'll find that when you
listen more attentively and you stop interrupting people,

44
00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:26.960
especially when they're telling personal stories or
answering questions that only they have the answer to, you

45
00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:31.640
don't want to interrupt their thought process. There are
times when you can do that skillfully, but that's like a

46
00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:37.250
higher level of communication skill. So I think when you
start at the basic level, you just have to learn to listen

47
00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:43.160
attentively because people will start to tell you things
that you need to know or tell you things that make what

48
00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:47.900
they're saying more interesting or give you more data to
process, and then take the conversation in a different

49
00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:53.640
direction or learn more about them or understand what
they're truly trying to communicate. Because another thing

50
00:04:53.640 --> 00:05:01.750
you have to remember is a lot of people are so lazy with
their word choice. They just find the basic, simplest way to

51
00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:08.350
say things in very vague, you know, in very vague terms. And
sometimes it's consciously, other times it's...it's an

52
00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:14.720
unconscious thing that we do. And so sometimes you have to,
like, be the person that's going to go the extra mile and

53
00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:20.300
put in the extra effort to pull information out of somebody. 
And you don't do that by asking them a million questions.

54
00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:27.410
You do that by listening and looking for things like
the...the key points of what they're saying, to then take

55
00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:32.280
the conversation in the direction you want it to go or
to...to encourage them to share the information you really

56
00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:38.500
want from them. And I know this might be confusing or might
make it might not make any sense out of context, because I'm

57
00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:43.490
just speaking off the cuff at this moment, and I'm not
giving you too many clear examples, but I'm hoping that I'm

58
00:05:43.530 --> 00:05:51.120
getting my point across to you. Do not underestimate the
power of listening. Do not underestimate the advantage of

59
00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:57.340
letting somebody finish their thought before you jump in to
contribute yours. You can share your thought. You can say

60
00:05:57.340 --> 00:06:03.430
whatever it is you have to say. Just wait your fucking turn,
you know what I'm saying? And like I said, there are times

61
00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:07.750
it's natural, man. In a conversation, people talk over each
other. They cut each other off. They want to show that they

62
00:06:07.750 --> 00:06:13.850
understand and they're connecting and they're engaged. I get
it, bro. This is not me trying to talk shit and say you're a

63
00:06:13.850 --> 00:06:19.140
piece of shit for not listening or you're a piece of shit
for having this knee-jerk reaction because I have it too. My

64
00:06:19.140 --> 00:06:26.280
point is, like, you need to be aware of it and then maybe
you'll realize, "I can choose a different reaction in those

65
00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:33.450
moments." Just..."I can resist the urge to jump in and cut
this other person off and shut them down. I can humble

66
00:06:33.450 --> 00:06:38.620
myself and realize, like, listening is just as important as
speaking. What they have to say is just as important as what

67
00:06:38.620 --> 00:06:43.950
I have to say. Because if it weren't, then why the fuck
would I be having a conversation with this person?" Right?

68
00:06:44.550 --> 00:06:52.020
So don't always allow that knee-jerk reaction to dictate
what you do. And not just in conversation, but just in life.

69
00:06:52.020 --> 00:06:57.320
You need to be aware of what some people call "triggers",
and you need to be aware of the knee-jerk reactions you have

70
00:06:57.390 --> 00:07:02.190
when you get triggered. And when I say "triggered" in this
case, it's not even just negative stuff because like I said,

71
00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:09.270
it could be a conversation about something positive. Just
resist that need, that knee-jerk reaction to cut people off,

72
00:07:09.650 --> 00:07:14.320
to share everything that you're thinking and feeling, you
know what I mean? And have a little bit more patience and

73
00:07:14.320 --> 00:07:21.840
self-control to listen to the person that you're speaking
with. You see what I'm saying? And of course, you also don't

74
00:07:21.840 --> 00:07:27.950
want to get in a situation where you're just listening the
entire time or letting this other person go on and on and on

75
00:07:27.950 --> 00:07:35.260
and on. There's many tactics and strategies or things you
can say or do when communicating with people, you know, to

76
00:07:35.710 --> 00:07:41.680
maneuver these situations you find yourself in...in
conversation, right? So I don't even know if I'm making much

77
00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:47.880
sense to you, man, sometimes, like, the way I think about
things is hard to explain with words. And that's why I

78
00:07:47.880 --> 00:07:53.500
typically like to write podcast episodes before I record
them, because it helps me, like, organize my thoughts and

79
00:07:53.500 --> 00:08:00.510
explain what it is I believe I understand in a concise, easy
to digest way, but when I'm just spitballing like this, I'm

80
00:08:00.510 --> 00:08:05.310
like, "Man, if somebody's going to be following me here..."
I hope so. If you're still with me, obviously you're

81
00:08:05.310 --> 00:08:12.170
following me. So, yeah, man, I just wanted to, like, put
that on your mind today because it's super, super, super,

82
00:08:12.170 --> 00:08:19.020
super common when communicating with people. Some people are
just on autopilot or they have low levels of self-awareness.

83
00:08:19.020 --> 00:08:24.070
Nobody ever brought it to their attention that they're poor
listeners or that they cut people off too much or they're

84
00:08:24.070 --> 00:08:29.240
too involved with what they have to say. I mean, all these
things don't even make you a bad person or communicator, but

85
00:08:29.290 --> 00:08:38.750
it's just communication is a skill and sometimes we don't
actively try to assess and then improve our own skills.

86
00:08:38.750 --> 00:08:45.120
A lot of times there's... I did this in the past, man,
for...I spent so much...I wasted so much time, like,

87
00:08:45.120 --> 00:08:51.630
criticizing other people's way of communication instead of
improving my own, because I find it very, very, very fucking

88
00:08:51.630 --> 00:08:56.770
irritating when somebody is constantly cutting me off or
they're not truly listening to what I have to say. They're

89
00:08:56.770 --> 00:09:01.600
not showing actual interest. But they said they were
interested in talking with me. All these things that just

90
00:09:01.900 --> 00:09:08.130
irritate me personally. But so what? That...I mean, they
irritate me. That doesn't mean that the world needs to

91
00:09:08.130 --> 00:09:14.310
change the way they communicate just so that I feel more
appreciated in a conversation. That's not how shit works. I

92
00:09:14.310 --> 00:09:19.130
had to improve my communication skills and show more empathy
and just understand if somebody is cutting me off, it

93
00:09:19.130 --> 00:09:23.160
doesn't mean that they don't care what I have to say or
they're not interested or...or whatever, they just have a

94
00:09:23.240 --> 00:09:29.440
different communication style, a different level of skill,
different set of values, or are focused on different things

95
00:09:29.440 --> 00:09:37.210
in the conversation and that's fine, right? So I had to
control, like, or I had to control my...my

96
00:09:39.030 --> 00:09:45.290
decision-making, for lack of a better term, I had to, like,
be aware of my knee-jerk reaction when I come across

97
00:09:45.290 --> 00:09:51.090
somebody I see as a poor communicator because I'm not a
fucking expert communicator either. I'm sure there's a lot

98
00:09:51.090 --> 00:09:58.970
of shit that I say or do that could be improved or stopped
altogether, you know what I mean? So um, anyway, man, the

99
00:09:58.970 --> 00:10:04.690
point is, like I said...like I say, from time to time, I'm
learning a...new stuff about communication all the time. So

100
00:10:05.150 --> 00:10:09.570
whenever I can share it with you, give you something to
think about, I think that's valuable, man. So give

101
00:10:09.570 --> 00:10:15.590
this...this idea some thought. Analyze, like, take a look at
yourself in your conversations, your life, the conversations

102
00:10:15.690 --> 00:10:22.480
around you and just see if you can start to notice what I'm
talking about in yourself or in other people, and then maybe

103
00:10:22.480 --> 00:10:29.630
you can kind of develop some way to to overcome those
knee-jerk reactions and really take control of your decision

104
00:10:29.630 --> 00:10:34.340
making so that you can have more productive conversations,
make deeper connections with people who understand people

105
00:10:34.340 --> 00:10:41.170
better, because those kinds of things lead to everything you
want in life, whether it's more money, more relationships,

106
00:10:41.170 --> 00:10:48.230
more travels, more success, a better job, whatever it is,
it's communication, bro. It is communication. It is the

107
00:10:48.230 --> 00:10:54.320
difference between getting that job and not getting that
job. It is the difference between making that salary and not

108
00:10:54.320 --> 00:10:59.270
making that salary, getting access to this place or not
getting access. Getting her phone number or not getting it.

109
00:10:59.270 --> 00:11:06.460
You understand what I'm saying? Communication, bro.
Communication. You and I are going to develop our

110
00:11:06.460 --> 00:11:12.040
communication skills one day at a time. Alright? But that's
it for now, my friend. Hopefully you enjoyed this episode of

111
00:11:12.040 --> 00:11:17.800
the Life in English podcast. I am your sensei, Tony Kaizen,
and I'll talk to you soon. Peace!

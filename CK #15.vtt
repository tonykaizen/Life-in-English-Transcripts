00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:05.190
In this video, I'm going to explain the difference between the words "everything" and "all".

2
00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:13.570
What's up, my friend? This is Coffee with Kaizen number 15.

3
00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:18.360
And like I said in the intro, I'm going to explain the words everything and all

4
00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:22.170
Because these are two words that learners of English get confused all the time.

5
00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:23.710
There's a very simple difference.

6
00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:25.600
So hopefully by the end of this episode,

7
00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:30.380
It will be crystal clear in your mind and you can use these words just like a native speaker.

8
00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:33.270
So the first thing you need to understand is that the words

9
00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:36.470
"everything" and "all" really have the same idea.

10
00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:38.710
But when you think of the word "all",

11
00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:43.540
I want you to think of the whole thing or the entire thing.

12
00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:50.250
For example, all the people or all the food or all the time.

13
00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:53.030
So in these examples, let's imagine a group of people.

14
00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:56.520
I'm talking about the entire group, the whole thing.

15
00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:01.220
Or in the example of the food, I'm talking about all of the food on the table,

16
00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:05.670
The whole table, and all of the food on it. You see? The entire thing.

17
00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:12.340
Now, what you need to remember is that the word all is almost always used with a noun.

18
00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:18.350
For example, did you eat all the pizza? Did you eat all the pizza?

19
00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:23.240
It's very common for learners of English to use the word "all" without a noun,

20
00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:26.460
Probably because that's how it works in their language.

21
00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:32.080
For example, they might say something like, "Did you eat all?". Did you eat all?

22
00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:38.610
My friend, please do not use the word all without a noun. There are some exceptions.

23
00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:42.380
There are some cases in which you will use the word "all" without a noun,

24
00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:45.280
And they're rare. But I'll still give you an example.

25
00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:48.450
So let's imagine that you're having a conversation with somebody

26
00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:52.730
And they're just complaining and complaining and complaining and you're so tired of hearing it.

27
00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:56.620
And at the end of their speech, you know, when they finish talking,

28
00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:59.550
You might say something like, "Is that all?".

29
00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:03.750
Is that all? Right? Is that everything you wanted to say?

30
00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:06.950
Now, you noticed in that sentence I said "all" and "everything".

31
00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:11.090
And that's because in this case, the word all is functioning more like the word everything.

32
00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.490
And I'm still going to explain that word in just a second.

33
00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:19.490
So back to my example. Is that all? Is that all? I didn't use a noun in that case.

34
00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:23.260
I didn't say "all the this" or "all the that". Just said, is that all?

35
00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:29.320
Now, to confirm in the same example, that same situation, after you ask me, is that all?

36
00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:35.790
I can respond by saying, "Yes, that's all. That's all. That is all".

37
00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:40.180
Now, again, like I said, it kind of functions like the word "everything" in this case,

38
00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:42.970
Because I could also say "That is everything".

39
00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:48.260
It's just more common, a more natural in that particular situation to say "that is all".

40
00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:56.190
So the rule to remember, again, is that you must use a noun with the word all, almost every single time.

41
00:02:56.580 --> 00:03:00.440
Like all the people, all the food, all the time,

42
00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:03.450
All the countries, all the something. Ok?

43
00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:07.180
Remember that sentence structure any time you want to use the word "all".

44
00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:11.440
Because in my mind, as a native English speaker, if you use the word all,

45
00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:15.550
Naturally my brain is already asking, "All the what?".

46
00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:20.520
It has to be all of the something. All the what? That's naturally my question.

47
00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:23.770
So you need to think that way when you're going to use this word. All right?

48
00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:26.380
Now let's talk about the word "everything".

49
00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:31.440
Everything is actually a pronoun like you, me, she, we, them, etc.

50
00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:35.860
And what this word actually means is each and every single thing.

51
00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:39.010
That's what you can think of when you hear the word "everything".

52
00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:43.680
Every single thing or every individual thing.

53
00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:47.410
For example, she understands everything.

54
00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:52.960
So I explain 20 different things and she understands every single thing I explained.

55
00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:56.740
Or I could say, I left everything at home.

56
00:03:57.390 --> 00:03:59.720
So I own a bunch of things. I have many possessions.

57
00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:04.390
I have a backpack, a camera, a phone, a passport, all of that. You see?

58
00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:09.430
All of that, in this case. That is the noun. So I left all of that at home.

59
00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:13.660
I left every single thing or everything at home.

60
00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:20.730
So the rule to remember here is that "everything" implies every single or every individual thing.

61
00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:24.040
So at the end of this explanation, I could ask you,

62
00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:25.770
Did you understand everything?

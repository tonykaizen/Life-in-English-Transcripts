00:00:01.180 --> 00:00:02.350
I once heard somebody say,

2
00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:07.170
"greatness is achieved when personal mastery inspires the masses."

3
00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:11.740
That's the greatest definition of greatness I've ever heard.

4
00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:16.250
Now, although I love that quote, it's not the focus of this episode.

5
00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:18.920
When I say being great, it's easier than ever.

6
00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:22.240
I mean, it's easier than ever to be the best at whatever it is you do.

7
00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:28.160
Whatever your occupation, craft, personal interests, personality type, it doesn't matter.

8
00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.280
Being great is easier than ever.

9
00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:35.220
And I say that because no matter what it is, you're trying to succeed at in this life,

10
00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:36.670
You're going to have competition.

11
00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:40.620
Now, of course, your only real competition is yourself, but you get my point, right?

12
00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:45.610
You could be trying to get a job or start a company, earn a scholarship, win a game.

13
00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:49.350
There's going to be competition. But here's the thing.

14
00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:53.330
50% of your competition really ain't worth shit, to begin with.

15
00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:55.600
They won't even show up when it's game time.

16
00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:59.940
And what I mean is 50% of the people you're competing with won't even try.

17
00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.810
You beat them simply by taking a chance and getting started.

18
00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:11.270
To prove my point I want you to stop and ask yourself if you've ever met someone who was always talking about what they were going to do,

19
00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.060
But never telling you about what they did.

20
00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:21.730
And I've got good news for you. That's 50% of the people that you perceive as a threat.

21
00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:26.360
That's 50% of the people you believe are capable of beating you.

22
00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:30.830
I've talked to so many people with great potential to do amazing things,

23
00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:33.900
But they simply refuse to take action and make something happen.

24
00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:39.710
It's just easier to make excuses, and, you know, maybe even not think about it at all. Right?

25
00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:45.240
And it's kind of sad, but that's the way it is. A lot of people have dreams,

26
00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:48.480
But not everyone is willing to do what it takes to realize them, right?

27
00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:53.010
But now let's talk about the other 50% of your competition.

28
00:01:54.550 --> 00:02:01.290
30% of your competitors are totally fine with doing just the bare minimum. Just enough to get by.

29
00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:07.590
They're not hungry. They're not motivated. They're not goal-oriented. They're comfortable.

30
00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:12.480
The older I get, the more I realize just how dangerous comfort can be.

31
00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:22.050
But anyway, 30%. 30% of your competitors don't have their heart and soul invested into what they're doing like you do.

32
00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:28.440
They're not taking the time to study and get better. They're not putting in the work. They're not proactive.

33
00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:34.230
They're simply not on your level, you know. They could be, but they choose not to be.

34
00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:38.370
What that means is if you're simply willing to do more,

35
00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:44.470
Learn more and give more than just the bare minimum and show up every single day,

36
00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:50.350
You've already beat 80% of your competition. 80%.

37
00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:57.770
So many people are just trying to get by, so many people are comfortable with the life that was handed to them.

38
00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:02.760
People are preoccupied with all types of nonsense, like toxic relationships,

39
00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:07.320
Vanity, gossip, people's opinions, the fear of failure, and embarrassment.

40
00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:13.930
But that's not you. You are a cut above the rest. You feel me? And you know why?

41
00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:16.500
Because you're putting your money where your mouth is.

42
00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:19.120
You're not just saying you're going to improve your English.

43
00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:23.080
You're investing time, effort, and money into your education.

44
00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:27.540
You're listening to this podcast. You're practicing your English with me and other VIPs.

45
00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:31.710
You're engaged. You're asking questions. You're focused on fluency.

46
00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:38.520
While 80% of the people in the same position as you are busy doing everything except trying to improve their English.

47
00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:42.520
And like I said, this is true for everything you want to achieve in life.

48
00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:47.440
And of course, learning English is not a competition, but I'm sure you get my point.

49
00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:54.910
Learning English could be the difference between getting the last job opening or scholarship vacancy or exchange program spot.

50
00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:57.040
So in that sense, it is a competition.

51
00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:04.590
But let's not forget the last 20%. This right here is your competition,

52
00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:10.540
Just 20% of the people who are trying to achieve the same goal as you are actually going to make an effort.

53
00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:18.320
You know, there's this concept called 'the Pareto Principle' P A R E T O, PARETO.

54
00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:23.690
I'm sure there's a correct way to pronounce it, and it's not the way I just pronounced it, but just follow me.

55
00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:32.660
Pareto principle, this principle says that about 80% of the results come from about 20% of the effort.

56
00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:34.720
No matter what it is you're doing.

57
00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:42.130
So if you're running a business, just 20% of all the work you do is generating 80% of the revenue.

58
00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:47.200
The other 80% of the work you're doing only produces 20% of the results.

59
00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:51.390
That's why, as a business owner, you must find a way to let other people,

60
00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:55.530
Or even robots do the things that aren't producing the majority of the results.

61
00:04:56.560 --> 00:05:01.700
You need to put all your time and energy into the 20% of the things that are generating all the revenue.

62
00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:05.980
The other 80% of things are just robbing you of time and energy,

63
00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:08.400
And they don't produce nearly the same quality of results.

64
00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:11.240
So getting back to your competition,

65
00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:19.980
It's safe to say that 20 out of 100 people are going to take advantage of and enjoy 80% of the opportunities to be great and successful.

66
00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:24.190
The other 80%, or excuse me, the other 80 out of 100 people

67
00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:28.550
Will have to fight over the remaining 20% of opportunities to be successful.

68
00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:32.980
And by simply showing up every day and giving it your best shot,

69
00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:38.020
You'll be part of the 20% that actually knows what it means to work hard and be successful.

70
00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:40.590
Now, of course, you'll still have to compete.

71
00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:45.750
The top 20% of competitors are in the top 20% for a reason, right?

72
00:05:46.850 --> 00:05:47.980
They wanted just as bad as you.

73
00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:51.780
They're willing to work the long hours, study on weekends,

74
00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:55.480
Step outside their comfort zones, find solutions to their problems.

75
00:05:56.650 --> 00:06:01.730
They're dedicated, they're driven, they're hungry, and they are ready to take your lunch.

76
00:06:03.420 --> 00:06:06.360
Now, that might sound a little sinister, but it's the truth.

77
00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:12.500
It's just a part of life. And I'd much rather compete with 20 people than a hundred people.

78
00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:20.130
Now, maybe it's not really healthy to think about life as a competition because it really is not a competition,

79
00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:28.050
But the fact of the matter is there are hundreds, maybe even thousands of people who had the same dream as you.

80
00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:31.780
And they won't stop at anything until they realize that dream.

81
00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:35.930
They won't stop at anything until they achieve greatness.

82
00:06:37.090 --> 00:06:39.680
So all you have to decide is which side of the line you fall on.

83
00:06:41.290 --> 00:06:45.800
The 80% of underachievers or the 20% of go-getters.

84
00:06:48.030 --> 00:06:49.480
Is easier than ever to be great,

85
00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:53.260
Because the vast majority of your competition won't even get out of bed to challenge you.

86
00:06:55.570 --> 00:07:00.670
You'll see results and maybe even get recognized if you simply do more than the bare minimum.

87
00:07:02.050 --> 00:07:05.720
If you just show up every single day and stay focused on growth and improvement,

88
00:07:05.720 --> 00:07:09.490
It won't be long before you and all those around you recognize your greatness, man.

89
00:07:11.020 --> 00:07:14.140
You might realize that it was nowhere near as hard as you thought it was going to be,

90
00:07:14.870 --> 00:07:19.440
And you'll probably start to understand why I'm always saying stop making excuses and just fucking do it.

91
00:07:20.940 --> 00:07:26.410
So it's up to you. You know? Greatness or mediocrity?

92
00:07:28.180 --> 00:07:31.940
Who you become and where you end up in life is a reflection of your choices.

93
00:07:33.660 --> 00:07:34.730
So I hope you choose greatness.

00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:03.190
Life in English 151.

2
00:00:03.190 --> 00:00:12.350
What's the hardest part or the hardest thing about learning
English? Take fucking three, by the way, I think.

3
00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:22.170
Alright shawty, let's do this goddamn thing. Let's do it.
Make sure my mic is correctly positioned for

4
00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:26.940
the optimal listening experience. And let's get started.

5
00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:35.120
Alright. I was talking with our friends on Discord the other
day, and an interesting question came up in conversation.

6
00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:39.390
What's the biggest problem for people learning English?

7
00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:51.910
One of the biggest problems that people have when they're
learning English is that they approach the language the same

8
00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:59.560
way they approached math and science in high school. One
plus one equals two. This war happened on this day. This

9
00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:06.590
element has three protons and that one has six electrons. A
lot of people think they can take a class by a course,

10
00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:14.520
memorize some information, pass a test, and then they'll
officially be fluent in English. I mean, that's the way we

11
00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.980
did it in school. Right?

12
00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:24.390
But let me ask you something, how much of the stuff you
learned in school do you actually remember? My guess is less

13
00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:27.230
than 10%. And why is that?

14
00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:35.080
Because you never found a use for all that information you
were told to memorize. And let me ask you another question,

15
00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:44.760
have you ever forgotten how to speak your first language? Of
course not. And why is that? Because you use it every

16
00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:46.200
single day.

17
00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:53.150
So I've noticed that a lot of people have a hard time
getting out of their own way. They slow themselves down by

18
00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:59.210
trying to memorize words and grammar rules. They waste
countless hours watching YouTube videos and TV series,

19
00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:05.990
taking notes and trying to understand what's being said. And
I say that's a waste of time, because after all of that,

20
00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:14.290
they never put it into practice with real people. Another
problem English learners have, or really people in general,

21
00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:21.610
is that they don't value their education. After four years
of teaching English online, I noticed that a lot of people

22
00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:29.110
treat their education the way they treat their
entertainment. They want it cheap, fast, and easy. And what

23
00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:35.590
I mean is when you want to be entertained, you pay a certain
amount of money. And in exchange for that money, someone or

24
00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:40.100
something works to entertain you. You pay. They work.

25
00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:48.370
You enjoy. And I've seen so many of you make the mistake of
setting the same expectation for your learning process. You

26
00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:54.610
think you can pay for a result? In your mind, you pay a
certain amount of money and in exchange for that money,

27
00:02:54.610 --> 00:03:03.410
someone or something will work to educate you. You pay. They
work. You learn. And to make it even worse, you want to pay

28
00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:12.260
the least amount of money possible for the most important
asset you will ever possess. Your education. For four years

29
00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:20.820
now, I've heard countless people ask the same questions. "Is
it free?" "Can I have a discount?" "Do I have to pay for

30
00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:30.410
it?" "How much does it cost?" "Do you offer refunds?" I'm
not exaggerating when I tell you that not a single person in

31
00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:38.030
four years has asked me, "How is this going to help me
improve?" "What makes this different from the other options

32
00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:47.760
I have?" "Who exactly was this made for?" "How am I supposed
to use this to improve?" If you don't know how to do

33
00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:55.920
anything, you're of no use to anyone. And people who are of
no use to anyone have a hard time functioning in society.

34
00:03:56.850 --> 00:04:03.840
They don't have many friends. They don't attract romantic
partners. They can't get jobs. Life just sucks when you

35
00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:11.380
don't know how to do anything. And I don't mean to be harsh.
It's just a fact. And you can only do what you know how to

36
00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:15.030
do. I know that sounds simple.

37
00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:20.410
I'm not trying to talk to you like you're stupid, but you
can only do what you know how to do and everything you know

38
00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:28.930
how to do. You either learned on your own through trial and
error, or someone taught you how to do it. So why the fuck

39
00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:35.020
are you taking your education so lightly, bro? Why are you
acting like it's something that can wait or something that

40
00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:43.250
can be obtained passively? Why are you willing to pay more
for luxury than education? Without a proper education, you

41
00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:50.510
are fucked, bro. We all know this. So if we want to be
educated, we've got to sacrifice the desire for instant

42
00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:57.650
gratification and simply put in the time and the effort, and
quite possibly invest the money in order to acquire a skill

43
00:04:57.650 --> 00:05:07.420
that will enable us to meet more people, make more money,
and take advantage of more opportunities in life. Another

44
00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:16.390
huge problem that English learners all around the world have
is that they make excuses. So many excuses.

45
00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:22.900
"I can't afford classes." "I don't live in an English
speaking country." "I don't have anyone to practice with."

46
00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:30.970
"I don't have time to practice my English." "I don't know
how to learn English." But it's all bullshit. If you're

47
00:05:30.970 --> 00:05:35.380
listening to this, then that means you've got access to the
Internet. And if you've got access to the Internet, then

48
00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:43.390
that means you have everything you need to learn any widely
spoken language in the world, especially English. Private

49
00:05:43.390 --> 00:05:51.490
classes, group classes, online courses, YouTube videos, TV
series, language exchange apps, Discord servers, podcasts,

50
00:05:51.490 --> 00:05:59.660
books, writing tools. You can access the majority of the
things I just mentioned for free. You just got to be

51
00:05:59.660 --> 00:06:08.130
practical and put in the fucking work every single day.
There are no shortcuts and there's no amount of money you

52
00:06:08.130 --> 00:06:14.950
can pay to have someone else learn something for you. A lot
of you are out here saying you want to learn this language,

53
00:06:14.950 --> 00:06:22.540
but what you mean to say is it would be nice to learn this
language, and that's completely different. When you truly

54
00:06:22.540 --> 00:06:29.940
want something, you do whatever is necessary to get it. If
you're truly thirsty, you will find a way to get yourself

55
00:06:29.940 --> 00:06:37.890
something to drink. If you're truly hungry, you will find a
way to get yourself some food. It would be nice to have

56
00:06:37.890 --> 00:06:43.890
$1,000,000, for example, but that's not really what you
want. And we know that for a fact because you're not doing

57
00:06:43.890 --> 00:06:51.040
anything to make that happen right now. It would be nice to
speak English fluently, but that's not really what you want.

58
00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:58.130
And we know that to be true because you're not putting in
the work to make it happen. What you most likely want is to

59
00:06:58.130 --> 00:07:04.130
be able to spend a few dollars in a couple of weeks watching
videos and to magically wake up and speak this language

60
00:07:04.130 --> 00:07:11.390
fluently. So a lot of you just need to cut the bullshit,
stop making excuses, and determine what it is you really

61
00:07:11.390 --> 00:07:18.890
want. And if what you want is to speak English fluently,
then you've got to read every day. You've got to write every

62
00:07:18.890 --> 00:07:27.980
day. You've got to listen every day. And you've got to speak
every single day. Once it's truly a priority of yours,

63
00:07:27.980 --> 00:07:34.060
you'll naturally make time for it, just like the rest of
your priorities. Now, I'm sure this isn't the nicest thing

64
00:07:34.060 --> 00:07:39.820
you've heard today, but my intention is to help you get out
of your own way and start making real progress, not to tell

65
00:07:39.820 --> 00:07:46.600
you what sounds good. I'm here to keep it real with you. And
on some real shit, a lot of y'all aren't making progress

66
00:07:46.600 --> 00:07:55.410
because you're just too busy making excuses. Now, another
huge problem that English learners have is that they refuse

67
00:07:55.410 --> 00:08:05.210
to become good listeners and learn the art of communication.
Listening attentively is such an underrated skill.

68
00:08:06.210 --> 00:08:14.060
And there are two types of attentive listening you need to
develop. The first one is all about pattern recognition. Now

69
00:08:14.170 --> 00:08:18.410
I realized that I have to be careful when I talk about
things like this, because sometimes I tell you to do

70
00:08:18.410 --> 00:08:25.010
something that comes naturally to me. But I forget that
what's easy for me might be extremely difficult for you. But

71
00:08:25.010 --> 00:08:31.440
my point is the same. Being able to recognize patterns is
one of three reasons I've managed to learn two foreign

72
00:08:31.440 --> 00:08:39.480
languages by myself. Giving all of my attention to the
person I was listening to and recognizing that I can derive

73
00:08:39.480 --> 00:08:46.800
meaning from their tone of voice. They always connect these
words in a particular way. People from this particular walk

74
00:08:46.800 --> 00:08:53.170
of life express themselves in this particular way. They
always reference the time of day at the beginning of their

75
00:08:53.170 --> 00:08:59.530
sentences. The subject can go at the beginning or the end of
the sentence. Some people pronounce their words this way and

76
00:08:59.530 --> 00:09:06.780
other people pronounce their words that way. Recognizing
those patterns makes it so much easier to understand people

77
00:09:06.780 --> 00:09:14.750
when they speak and identify words and phrases that are
commonly used by most people. And the second reason I was

78
00:09:14.750 --> 00:09:21.680
able to learn two foreign languages by myself is the second
type of attentive listening you need to develop. And this

79
00:09:21.680 --> 00:09:27.710
form of attentive listening is all about listening with the
intention of understanding what's being communicated instead

80
00:09:27.710 --> 00:09:35.670
of simply listening with the intention of responding to
what's being said. A lot of people listen solely for the

81
00:09:35.670 --> 00:09:41.340
sake of responding. They don't want to listen, understand,
and learn.

82
00:09:41.760 --> 00:09:49.980
They just want to be heard. And the problem is, no one
enjoys speaking to a poor listener. No one enjoys being

83
00:09:49.980 --> 00:09:56.430
interrupted constantly. No one enjoys feeling like they're
speaking to a wall. And no one enjoys feeling like they're

84
00:09:56.430 --> 00:10:04.840
not interesting enough to be listened to. So if you're a
poor listener, you won't be very much fun to speak with. And

85
00:10:04.840 --> 00:10:10.480
that means you probably won't have many people to speak
with. And that means it's going to be really hard for you to

86
00:10:10.480 --> 00:10:17.780
make friends and improve your spoken English. So I'm asking
you to invest some serious time into learning the art of

87
00:10:17.780 --> 00:10:24.740
communication. Learn how conversations work. Pay attention
to the differences in cultural communication styles. Use the

88
00:10:24.740 --> 00:10:32.150
context of a situation to infer what's being communicated.
Learn how to ask questions. Understand the role that silence

89
00:10:32.150 --> 00:10:38.030
plays in a conversation. Learn how to encourage people to
tell you more about something. Learn how to start a

90
00:10:38.030 --> 00:10:46.250
conversation. Learn how to keep a conversation going. Learn
how to end a conversation. You must develop the skill of

91
00:10:46.280 --> 00:10:54.830
being able to talk to anyone anytime, anywhere. That is how
you take advantage of every opportunity to practice your

92
00:10:54.830 --> 00:11:01.160
English. That is how you understand and internalize what's
being communicated even if you don't understand every word.

93
00:11:01.850 --> 00:11:08.600
That is how you make new friends. That is how you discover
new opportunities to make your life and the lives of those

94
00:11:08.600 --> 00:11:10.250
around you richer.

95
00:11:12.290 --> 00:11:19.010
Spoken language is learned through conversation. So it's in
your best interest to learn how to have a conversation. And

96
00:11:19.010 --> 00:11:28.930
that has nothing to do with the language you speak. It all
starts and ends with good communication skills. Now,

97
00:11:28.930 --> 00:11:36.470
the third reason I was able to learn these languages by
myself is simply that I really wanted to do it. When I was

98
00:11:36.470 --> 00:11:42.290
learning Spanish, I would study and practice for 3 to 4
hours a day.

99
00:11:42.920 --> 00:11:50.090
Literally all my free time. I spoke Portuguese every day for
four years straight, bro.

100
00:11:50.540 --> 00:11:57.620
And I didn't even go to Brazil until year three. I didn't
spend a single dollar on a course. I didn't take a single

101
00:11:57.620 --> 00:12:06.630
class. Nothing like that. I simply used my curiosity to my
advantage. I learned how to listen attentively. And I talked

102
00:12:06.630 --> 00:12:07.230
to people.

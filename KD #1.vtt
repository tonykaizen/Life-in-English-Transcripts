00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:08.280
What's up, my friend? This is Kaizen after Dark. I am your
host, Tony Kaizen, and I'm recording this after dark. And,

2
00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:16.550
uh, I guess you should know I'm recording this in my car cos
I'm about to head home. And, um, I don't know, I just had

3
00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:23.960
this on my mind. I was thinking about it recently and
figured it would be a good time to, uh, to say what's up to

4
00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:32.320
you, leave you with something to think about cos we were on
Discord yesterday, I believe, last night. And one of the

5
00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:41.370
topics that came up...actually, that's not a correct way of
saying it. There's a little bot on Discord that allows you

6
00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:48.840
to generate random conversation topics. So I activated the
little robot and it suggested the topic.

7
00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:56.650
Um...What's a memorable lesson that you had to learn the
hard way? And I just thought this was a really good

8
00:00:56.650 --> 00:01:03.560
question. I'm sure most of us have...poof...a bunch of
lessons that we had to learn the hard way. I don't know what

9
00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:12.120
it is about human beings. We just refuse to accept reality
sometimes, or we refuse to accept,

10
00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:20.660
um, yeah...just reality. I can't even think of a better word
for it. And forgive me if you hear, like, cars driving by

11
00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:27.540
and shit or, um, anything of that nature cos I'm just
chilling here in a parking lot. As strange as that might

12
00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:37.360
sound to you, I don't think it's weird. You know? It's my
car. If I want to fucking record a podcast on my ride, I'll

13
00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:44.000
record a podcast in my ride, goddammit. Anyway...Anyway,
that has nothing to do with the topic of discussion, my

14
00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:53.060
friend. I apologize. Anyway, what is something memorable...a
memorable lesson that I had to learn the hard way? As I was

15
00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:59.940
saying, I'm sure most of us have a bunch of those just
because sometimes we're just dumb, bro, like, we just refuse

16
00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:09.110
to learn what the universe is telling us we need to learn.
And the first thing that came to mind was -- or the first

17
00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:18.250
lesson that came to mind, I should say -- was, um, never
invest more than you're willing to lose. And this could be

18
00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:23.170
with money or time or energy.

19
00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:32.970
Anything. Anything that you can give to another person or
put into a project or relationship or a business or, you

20
00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:39.770
know, financial investments, like, anything, it can be
anything. Never invest more than you are willing to lose.

21
00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:49.040
Never give more than you'll be comfortable giving knowing
that you won't receive anything in return. First of all,

22
00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:56.810
true giving does not involve expecting something in return,
that's not giving, but that's beside the point. What I'm

23
00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:04.060
saying is a lot of times, especially when you've got good
intentions, you know, I guess a universal example might be

24
00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:10.860
in a relationship. You might have good intentions with this
person. You might want to give them your all, invest 150% of

25
00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:17.490
your love and your energy and your time and yourself into
the relationship and into this person just cos you love them

26
00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:23.060
so much and you want to treat them right and you just want
to make them happy or...or you want them to be happy with

27
00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:27.010
you. You can't make people happy, but you want them to be
happy with you and you want to be happy with them. Right?

28
00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:33.210
And, you know, sometimes even if things start out well, even
if both of you have good intentions in the beginning,

29
00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:40.220
sometimes shit just goes south, man. It happens all the time
in relationships. It doesn't matter if y'all are dating, if

30
00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:45.250
you're already married, if you've got kids. I mean, shit
happens, bro. And there are so many reasons for that. But

31
00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:51.840
the point is, you don't want to get to a point where you've
invested so much of yourself, your time, your energy, your

32
00:03:51.840 --> 00:04:00.960
money, whatever it may be, into a person or a romantic,
like, or committed relationship. And then the relationship

33
00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:08.620
ends. And all of that shit you put into it now is
meaningless. It's worthless. You can't get it back. And I

34
00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:13.220
shouldn't say that, you know, just because you broke up with
this person, just because you got a divorce, everything is

35
00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:20.050
wasted. That's not my point. What I'm trying to say is it's
very possible -- we have to accept -- it's very possible,

36
00:04:20.050 --> 00:04:27.980
any and every relationship, could end at any time for any
reason. Right? So to me, it only makes sense to, yes, give

37
00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:34.380
your all give as much as you possibly can in all of your
relationships. I believe you should love generously;

38
00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:42.710
however, do it with the understanding that there could come
a time when this person I'm investing so much into or this

39
00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:51.360
relationship or whatever that I'm investing so much into
could go to shit. That's a possibility. So it's probably

40
00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:58.560
smart if I don't put in more than I'm willing to lose
knowing that I could lose this relationship. You see what

41
00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:07.550
I'm saying? I don't know if that makes sense to you. In my
head, it makes sense because it's like...how can I say this?

42
00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:16.010
It's almost like a form of self-protection or
self-preservation.

43
00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:22.700
You know what I mean? Especially with relationships, bruh,
like you know...it's a...like a balance you got to find in

44
00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:30.270
between giving everything you possibly can to somebody and
also looking out for yourself. And really that's one and the

45
00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:35.470
same thing. That's what I mean by don't give more than what
you're willing to lose because giving everything you

46
00:05:35.470 --> 00:05:43.680
possibly can doesn't mean giving everything. There's a
difference, right? Giving everything you can give - it's not

47
00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:50.880
the same as giving everything you have. You see what I'm
saying? Like if...let's say, another example that I feel

48
00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:57.190
might be universal is let's say you're walking down the
street in a busy city and there's a homeless person that ask

49
00:05:57.190 --> 00:06:02.270
you for some money, "Hey, man, you got any spare change? You
got a couple of dollars? I'm just trying to get something to

50
00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:06.120
eat," or whatever. I got $1,000 in my pocket.

51
00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:12.240
I could give him $3, $5, $10, $20.

52
00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:16.230
I could buy him dinner, I could probably buy him a
sweatshirt and all these things. I'm not going to give him

53
00:06:16.230 --> 00:06:23.700
the whole thousand dollars unless I'm totally fine losing
$1,000. You see what I'm saying? I can give him what I can.

54
00:06:23.770 --> 00:06:29.110
And maybe this isn't even the best example. This example is
kind of dumb, but hopefully you get my point. It's just

55
00:06:29.110 --> 00:06:34.880
because I got a thousand doesn't mean I can give him a
thousand cos maybe I need 500 to pay my bills this month.

56
00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:41.230
Maybe I need 200 to pay for groceries, maybe I need 50 for
gas. So how can I give him a thousand? Then I'm...Imma be

57
00:06:41.230 --> 00:06:47.330
fucking homeless if I'm just giving everything I got away.
You feel me? So nothing wrong with giving. There's nothing

58
00:06:47.330 --> 00:06:52.690
wrong with being generous, you should be. If you hope to
receive anything in life, you must learn to give first, in

59
00:06:52.690 --> 00:07:00.820
my opinion. But you sh...I mean. I can't say you should not.
A lesson I learned the hard way is that I should not give

60
00:07:00.820 --> 00:07:07.120
more than I'm willing to lose or give more than I'd be
comfortable giving, knowing that it will never be

61
00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:12.930
reciprocated. You know? And it's the same thing with money
or anything else. Like if you're going to buy an NFT, if

62
00:07:12.930 --> 00:07:18.830
you're going to fucking buy a rental property, if you're
going to invest in the stock market, whatever, it's cool to

63
00:07:18.830 --> 00:07:25.710
take risks, man. I think the biggest and greatest winners in
life are the ones who are not afraid to take risks. I truly

64
00:07:25.710 --> 00:07:31.320
believe that. However, however, it doesn't mean be stupid,
right?

65
00:07:31.320 --> 00:07:37.500
There's a difference between taking a risk and being dumb.
And when you're taking risks, in this case financial risks,

66
00:07:37.500 --> 00:07:43.450
by investing your money into something and hoping to get a
return at some point, you've got to go in with the mindset

67
00:07:43.450 --> 00:07:49.030
that I could lose every single dollar that I'm about to
invest and I need to be okay with that. So whatever your

68
00:07:49.030 --> 00:07:55.290
threshold is, whatever your tolerance for that financial
risk is, that's where you stop, you know? And that way, if

69
00:07:55.290 --> 00:08:01.050
you do get a return, if you do win, excellent! But if you
lost it...or excuse me...if you lose it, then at least, you

70
00:08:01.050 --> 00:08:06.110
know, like, well, "I knew that going in, I could have lost
this shit so there's no reason for me to get emotional about

71
00:08:06.110 --> 00:08:12.480
it. I knew what it was from the beginning." That's what I
mean when I say don't invest more than you're willing to

72
00:08:12.480 --> 00:08:19.180
lose, bruh, because any and everything can go to shit at any
time. And I don't mean to be pessimistic when I say that.

73
00:08:19.180 --> 00:08:26.610
It's just real. That's real shit. I just try to be
realistic, you know what I mean? So I'm telling you this

74
00:08:26.610 --> 00:08:35.720
because it's what I would say to myself if I could talk to
my 16, 18, 21-year-old self, like, man, it's okay to take

75
00:08:35.720 --> 00:08:42.040
risks. It's okay to invest. It's okay to love hard. It's
okay to give as much as you possibly can in your career,

76
00:08:42.040 --> 00:08:49.510
your relationships, your investments, your business, but
just always be conscious of how much you're giving and...and

77
00:08:49.510 --> 00:08:54.350
what your limits actually are. What are you okay with
losing? What are you not okay with losing? You've got to

78
00:08:54.350 --> 00:09:02.830
learn to draw the line at some point. You know what I mean?
And, um, yeah, I just think that's a super important lesson,

79
00:09:02.830 --> 00:09:09.930
and I wanted to leave that on your brain this evening. So
um, if you're listening to this, you are a podcast

80
00:09:09.930 --> 00:09:15.730
supporter, which means you got access to the Discord server.
So hit me up, man. Let's start a conversation about this.

81
00:09:15.730 --> 00:09:23.000
Maybe you can let me know a hard lesson that you had to
learn, um, but that you'll always remember now that you've

82
00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:27.880
learned it. You know what I mean? Uh, and let me know what
you think about my thoughts. Hopefully it was clear to you.

83
00:09:27.880 --> 00:09:33.440
I'm kind of just freestyling here; I didn't write anything
down. But yeah, that's all I got for you right now, my

84
00:09:33.440 --> 00:09:40.030
friend. This is Kaizen after Dark, I am your host, Tony
Kaizen, recording after dark and I'll talk to you soon.

85
00:09:40.540 --> 00:09:40.840
Peace!

00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:06.350
Tony Kaizen:
Alright, my friend. So my first question for you is, if you
had to listen to three albums, and only three for the rest

2
00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:08.130
of your life, which albums would they be?

3
00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:11.080
Carlos:
Uh, 25, Adele.

4
00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:13.950
Tony Kaizen:
Somebody else said that, too.

5
00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:19.520
Carlos:
1989, Taylor Swift.

6
00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:22.500
Tony Kaizen:
Somebody else said the same one.

7
00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:29.050
Carlos:
I feel like I'm basic. Umm...

8
00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:29.490
That's...

9
00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:30.590
Tony Kaizen:
Hmm, tough question.

10
00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:39.830
Carlos:
Tough one. Yeah. See, I listen to a lot of music, but I
don't really have any sort of, like, favorites, so um...

11
00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:46.630
Tony Kaizen:
Let's stick with those two...

12
00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:47.580
Carlos:
Yeah, we'll stick with the two.

13
00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:53.060
Tony Kaizen:
That's cool. Alright. Alright. So now my next question is,
if all jobs paid the same amount of money and you were

14
00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:55.550
prepared to do any job in the world, which job would you do?

15
00:00:56.950 --> 00:01:05.960
Carlos:
Um, I would like to be an engineer of some kind, maybe
aerospace engineering or something like that.

16
00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:06.120
Tony Kaizen:
Really?

17
00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:12.250
Carlos:
Yeah, I've always wanted to do that. I actually did it for
like one semester in school and I dropped out of that

18
00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:17.610
because it was tough, but I would love to go back into it if
I had the time, and yeah.

19
00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:19.920
Tony Kaizen:
Where do you think that interest comes from? Aerospace?

20
00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:27.040
Carlos:
Um, I love building things. I love...I love putting things
together. That's always been my interest. I love, you know,

21
00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:34.230
solving problems that seem a little too crazy. So, yeah,
I've always kind of like being drawn to that.

22
00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:36.590
Tony Kaizen:
But you don't want to, like, fly the planes? You want to
build them?

23
00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:41.740
Carlos:
No, I don't want to fly them. I just want to build them. I'm
more interested in this sort of like the challenges that

24
00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:47.630
come with building an engine and making it work and going
from like, nothing to like something that's like more

25
00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.850
than...

26
00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:51.840
Tony Kaizen:
Yeah, definitely, definitely. So you said that after one
semester you kind of quit because it was getting too

27
00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.470
difficult, but what was so difficult about it?

28
00:01:54.760 --> 00:02:01.370
Carlos:
I wouldn't say it was difficult. I think I was just not
really sure of what direction I wanted to take at the time.

29
00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:07.640
I just sort of like went into it because I knew that was my
interest. That was something I was interested in, but I

30
00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:14.000
didn't have the right reasons at the time, and I wasn't
prepared for like, you know, aerospace engineering at the

31
00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:19.020
time. So yeah, I had to kind of like give up and be like,
okay, time to look for something else.

32
00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:23.880
Tony Kaizen:
Next thing...Yeah, I got it. Alright. Alright. So my last
question is, what are three things that you can't live

33
00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:24.230
without?

34
00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:34.870
Carlos:
Um, sunglasses, water, and um...My...I'm

35
00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:38.170
gonna say my passport because I love traveling.

36
00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:39.220
Yeah. That's a good one.

37
00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:39.540
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

38
00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:40.680
Tony Kaizen:
That's on my list, too. I like that.

39
00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:42.690
Carlos:
Oh, yeah, yeah. You can't leave without a passport.

40
00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:46.180
Tony Kaizen:
Alright. So let me ask you this, if you could visit any
country on the planet, which country would it be?

41
00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:54.400
Carlos:
Right now, I want to go to Mongolia. Ah, it's a country I've
always been interested in. Um, it's sort of like a very

42
00:02:55.430 --> 00:03:00.780
unique country. Not many people talk about it. You don't
meet that many people from Mongolia. So I've always been

43
00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:04.560
drawn to it. I've always been curious. So yeah.

44
00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:07.050
Tony Kaizen:
Out of curiosity, how many languages do you speak?

45
00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:17.770
Carlos:
Ah, good question! English, Spanish, um...Portuguese, if

46
00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:25.910
I'm forced to speak it. Swahili, um...and I think that's it.

47
00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:30.150
The rest of them, I just sort of like things I understand,
but I can't fully speak.

48
00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:31.470
Tony Kaizen:
Yeah. And where are you from?

49
00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:36.830
Carlos:
I'm from all over the place. I was born in one place. I grew
up in a different place. So I'm kind of like.

50
00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:38.140
Tony Kaizen:
Okay, yeah, where are you born?

51
00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:40.990
Carlos:
Ah, I don't want to get into that.

52
00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:41.510
Tony Kaizen:
Hmm.

53
00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:41.930
Carlos:
No.

54
00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:42.420
Tony Kaizen:
Okay.

55
00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:42.730
Carlos:
Yeah.

56
00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:44.130
Tony Kaizen:
But you live here in Atlanta now?

57
00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:48.300
Carlos:
Yeah, I live here. I've been here for nine...No, no, not
nine, seven years.

58
00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:49.140
Tony Kaizen:
Oh damn.

59
00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:49.520
Carlos:
Yeah.

60
00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:50.450
Tony Kaizen:
So what brought you to the city?

61
00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:58.850
Carlos:
Um, no reason. I just ended up here cos this is where my
family was. And I love it. I love Atlanta. Yeah.

62
00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:03.290
Tony Kaizen:
Nice, alright. So last question, if you could learn any
other language besides the ones you speak obviously now,

63
00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:04.490
what language would it be?

64
00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:16.340
Carlos:
Chinese. I would love to learn Chinese cos it intimidates me
a little bit. When I look at it, I'm like, "Whoa, what am I

65
00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:23.830
looking at?" But so I would love to maybe just have a...sort
of like a small understanding of what I'm reading, but yeah,

66
00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:24.580
Chinese.

67
00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:26.600
Tony Kaizen:
Yeah. Alright. Cool. Carlos, right?

68
00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:27.090
Carlos:
Yes.

69
00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:28.120
Tony Kaizen:
Thank you, man. We appreciate your time.

70
00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:28.730
Carlos:
Of course!

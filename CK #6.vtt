00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:09.250
Here are six words that are stronger than "good". Good 
morning, my friend.

2
00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:15.450
This is Coffee with Kaizen #6. And like I said in the intro 
today, I'm going. To teach you six different words that are

3
00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:20.300
stronger than the word "good".And I'm not just going to 
teach you the words. Hopefully I can give you the

4
00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:26.990
Definitions and a little bit of context because you need to 
know or at least have an idea of when to use each word, even

5
00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:35.430
though they're all similar. Alright, let's get started. 
Alright. Word number one is "great". "Great" means of an

6
00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:41.330
extent, amount, or intensity considerably above the normal
or average.

7
00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:50.510
That's a lot of words to say something very simple. "Great"
is just like "good" 2.0 or "good" on steroids, right? For

8
00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:57.230
example, I hope you have a great day. Like it's totally
normal for us to say, "Have a good day, have a nice day."

9
00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:03.520
But if I say, "I hope you have a great day", it just means
really, really, really, really good. You know, kind of like

10
00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:10.330
the definition said above the normal or above average. So
everybody has a good day. That's like level five, right? But

11
00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:16.970
a great day is like level ten, you know, really, really
good. That's the idea. So another example would be "You are

12
00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:20.410
a great teacher." Thank you.

13
00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:26.950
Again, what I'm saying there is you are above average.
Average is kind of like the normal level where most people

14
00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:33.220
live, where the majority is, the skill level of the
majority, that's average. But if you are a great teacher and

15
00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:41.590
you are above the rest, your quality is unmatched my friend.
You're great. You're not just "good", you're "great",

16
00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:50.300
right? Another example, "He has what it takes to be a great
leader." There's two things I want to explain there. The

17
00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:55.310
first one, "great" leader. Now you should have an idea. It
just means really, really, really good leader. Above

18
00:01:55.390 --> 00:02:03.280
average, you see, not the normal quality. Okay. But the
second thing is, when I say he has what it takes to be

19
00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:10.520
something. To have what it takes means to possess the
qualities or qualifications or whatever is necessary to do

20
00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:18.310
something. So if I say you have what it takes to be a great
leader, you have all the qualities necessary for being a

21
00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:23.140
great leader. Hopefully that makes sense. If it doesn't, let
me know in the comments or send me a message or whatever and

22
00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:31.780
I'll try to explain it in a different way. Alright. The next
word on the list is "amazing". "Amazing". Now, the

23
00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:40.980
definition of "amazing" is causing great surprise or wonder.
For example, I had an amazing time with you tonight. I had

24
00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:47.930
an amazing time with you tonight. So we went out on a date.
We went and saw a movie. I had lots of fun. And I say, "Man,

25
00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:54.710
I had an amazing time." Not just a good time, but it was
amazing. It was wonderful, right? It was really, really,

26
00:02:54.710 --> 00:03:03.340
really good. An amazing time. So another example, the energy
of the crowd was amazing. So imagine you went to a concert

27
00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:09.600
or your favorite band or your favorite singer or something
like that, and everybody in the crowd had so much energy and

28
00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:15.210
excitement and everybody was screaming and having a great
time. It's almost like you could feel the energy in the room

29
00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:22.320
rising and rising and rising. It was amazing. Something that
you will never forget. It wasn't just a good show. It was an

30
00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:32.200
amazing show, right? One more example. I can't believe you
learned two languages in six months. That's amazing. So

31
00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:36.880
basically what you're saying is that's surprising, but in a
really good way. That's really, really good. That's

32
00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:39.570
surprising. That is "amazing".

33
00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:45.620
Next word on the list. "Brilliant". "Brilliant".

34
00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:54.960
"Brilliant". And what this means is exceptionally clever or
talented or also outstanding or impressive. So, for example,

35
00:03:55.270 --> 00:04:02.880
she is a brilliant musician. She's a brilliant musician,
right? Her talent is amazing. It's outstanding. She's very,

36
00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:03.980
very clever.

37
00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:10.560
She's very smart. You might even call her a genius because
she's brilliant. Now, a very, very common way to use this

38
00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:17.510
word is with talents like I just showed you. So another
thing you could say is "Messi is a brilliant soccer player."

39
00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:24.170
He's a genius, right? Messi is not human, by the way. But,
you could say he's a "brilliant" soccer player. He's very,

40
00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:31.280
very smart, very clever, very intelligent, and uses his
talent in a very skillful and intelligent way. Hopefully

41
00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:37.240
that makes sense, you know? So again, when we use
"brilliant", a lot of times we're talking about intelligence

42
00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:43.840
or somebody being smart, but in a situation where we're
really referring to their talent, you see what I'm saying?

43
00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:50.540
Because a lot of people equate talent and intelligence for
whatever reason. So when you talk about somebody doing some

44
00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:57.580
type of thing, they have this high level of skill. You can
say they are "brilliant" at what they do. Alright, cool.

45
00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:00.870
Word number four. "Incredible".

46
00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:10.310
"Incredible". The definition of "incredible" is impossible
to believe or amazingly good or beautiful. It just kind of

47
00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:18.610
depends. So you could say that movie was incredible. That
movie was incredible. It was so good. I can't even believe

48
00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:26.880
how good it was. It was amazing. It was...It was brilliant.
It was great. It was "incredible". So, again, like I said,

49
00:05:27.290 --> 00:05:33.030
all of these words, depending on the context, have a similar
idea. It just means really, really, really good. Extremely

50
00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:39.860
good. But there are times when we'll choose one word instead
of the other. Okay, so back to "incredible". Another

51
00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:45.940
example. Let's imagine that you and your lady friend, you
guys are going out for dinner or for a date or something

52
00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:53.310
like that. And she comes downstairs in this red dress and
you're like "Goddamn, she looks incredible." And that's what

53
00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:58.580
you tell her. You can tell her. You won't just say "You look
good." You could say that, and there's nothing wrong with

54
00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:04.520
that. But if you really want to put emphasis on it, if you
really want to express that, it's not just good, it's a lot

55
00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:10.930
more than that. You can say, "You look incredible, you look
incredible." So good that I can't believe it. You see what

56
00:06:10.930 --> 00:06:17.100
I'm saying? Alright, next word on the list. Number five is
"breathtaking".

57
00:06:17.490 --> 00:06:23.400
This is one word b-r-e-a-t-h-t-a-k-i-n-g.

58
00:06:23.780 --> 00:06:29.180
"Breathtaking". That's all one word, alright? But it's
really two words put together as one word. And the

59
00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:36.420
definition is astonishing or awe-inspiring in quality so as
to take one's breath away.

60
00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:42.070
Now, that definition, I imagine, isn't the easiest thing to
understand for somebody who's learning English. So let me

61
00:06:42.070 --> 00:06:49.060
try to say it a different way. "Breathtaking" is something
that when you see it, it literally takes your breath away.

62
00:06:49.060 --> 00:06:56.220
So let's say in a really common way to use this word is when
we're talking about like the view from a particular place or

63
00:06:56.220 --> 00:07:01.010
the sunset and things like that. So let me give you an
example and then I'll keep explaining. A really common way

64
00:07:01.010 --> 00:07:09.240
to use this word is with the sunset. That sunset was
breathtaking. That sunset was breathtaking.

65
00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:17.350
So when you see it, it's so beautiful, it's so amazing, it's
so great, it's so wonderful. You see it and *gasp* like you

66
00:07:17.350 --> 00:07:23.960
literally stop breathing because it's just so profoundly
beautiful that sunset, like you see it and say, *gasp*

67
00:07:25.030 --> 00:07:28.320
"Wow." That is breathtaking, right?

68
00:07:28.430 --> 00:07:35.330
That's amazing. That's beautiful. That's wonderful. That's
the idea here. So another example, kind of like I said, is

69
00:07:35.330 --> 00:07:41.990
the view. So you can say the view from my home is
breathtaking. So imagine you live on the top of a mountain

70
00:07:42.410 --> 00:07:48.030
or something like that. And when you look out your window,
you can see the beach, you can see the entire city, you can

71
00:07:48.030 --> 00:07:56.220
see the entire forest, whatever it is. But the entire view,
everything you can see from your home inspires awe, inspires

72
00:07:57.150 --> 00:08:00.000
wonder and admiration.

73
00:08:00.170 --> 00:08:06.480
You see what I'm saying? It takes your breath away it's just
amazing. That's the idea. So "breathtaking", many times we

74
00:08:06.480 --> 00:08:11.400
won't use it when we're just saying something is good or
great. A lot of times something is "breathtaking" it's

75
00:08:11.400 --> 00:08:17.710
because it literally *gasp* takes your breath away. It's so
good or amazing or beautiful that you stop breathing just

76
00:08:17.710 --> 00:08:24.390
because it's so surprisingly good. Hopefully that makes
sense. I feel like I just said good, surprising, wonderful,

77
00:08:24.390 --> 00:08:30.250
great 50 times, but I'm just trying to help you understand
the context so that you can use the word the same way that I

78
00:08:30.250 --> 00:08:37.880
would use the word or any native would use the word.
Hopefully that makes sense. Alright, last word. Number six

79
00:08:37.960 --> 00:08:41.990
on the list is "outstanding". "Outstanding".

80
00:08:42.340 --> 00:08:48.490
Now the definition of "outstanding" is just exceptionally
good. That's literally the definition. So I could say, "You

81
00:08:48.490 --> 00:08:55.970
did an outstanding job." Man, you did an outstanding job. So
the way you can think about this word "outstanding" is to

82
00:08:55.970 --> 00:09:02.630
flip it around and say standing out because to "stand out",
which is actually a phrasal verb, I don't have the

83
00:09:02.630 --> 00:09:08.090
definition right here in front of me, but the way I
understand the word "stand out" or excuse me, the phrasal

84
00:09:08.090 --> 00:09:15.730
verb "stand out" is to be exceptional and very different
from the rest. That could be a good thing or that could be a

85
00:09:15.730 --> 00:09:20.750
bad thing. It just depends on the context. Actually, let me
find the definition really quick so I can explain it more

86
00:09:20.750 --> 00:09:28.850
clearly because this is important for you to understand. So
the dictionary definition that I found is to be clearly

87
00:09:28.850 --> 00:09:35.490
better or more significant than someone or something. So if
you're watching this on YouTube, it'll make much more sense

88
00:09:35.540 --> 00:09:40.310
because I'm going to show you visually, if you're just
listening, I'll try my best to explain it verbally. So

89
00:09:40.510 --> 00:09:47.410
again, to clearly be better or more significant than someone
or something, that's what it means to "stand out". So we

90
00:09:47.410 --> 00:09:53.570
have, let's say, five soccer players here and I'm number
six. We all play on the same team, but I "stand out" because

91
00:09:53.600 --> 00:10:00.360
I am clearly better. I'm clearly different. When you look at
all of us, your attention most likely goes to me because I'm

92
00:10:00.360 --> 00:10:06.600
so much better, because I "stand out", because my quality is
so much higher. My skill level is so much higher. Hopefully

93
00:10:06.600 --> 00:10:12.700
that makes sense. Alright. So getting back to the word
"outstanding", if I say you did an outstanding job, that

94
00:10:12.700 --> 00:10:19.720
just means you did an exceptionally good job, right? Not the
typical good job, but something so much better than the

95
00:10:19.720 --> 00:10:26.270
typical job or so much better than everyone else's job.
That's really what I'm saying. It was outstanding and a lot

96
00:10:26.270 --> 00:10:32.140
of times we'll use this word in relation to performance,
right? So your performance at work was outstanding, your

97
00:10:32.140 --> 00:10:38.450
performance in the football game was outstanding, your
performance on stage was outstanding. A lot of times we'll

98
00:10:38.450 --> 00:10:44.080
use it in that context. You can use it for anything that you
want to say, something stronger than "good". For example, I

99
00:10:44.080 --> 00:10:49.670
hope you have an outstanding day. It's not the most common
thing to say, but it doesn't make sense. Or you're going on

100
00:10:49.670 --> 00:10:54.940
a date with your girl and she looks great today. You can
say, "You look outstanding." Again, not the most common way

101
00:10:54.940 --> 00:11:00.750
to use that word, but it does make sense. So that's why I
spent so much time trying to give you the context in which

102
00:11:00.750 --> 00:11:06.490
we use all six of these words so that you can start to get
an idea of what they mean because they all just mean

103
00:11:06.490 --> 00:11:13.190
something stronger than "good", exceptionally good, better
than average things like that. That's...they all have that

104
00:11:13.240 --> 00:11:19.330
idea. But just like in your native language, there are words
that have similar meanings, but you choose particular words

105
00:11:19.330 --> 00:11:25.310
depending on the context, right? So that's the reason I
spent so much time trying to explain that. And hopefully it

106
00:11:25.310 --> 00:11:31.550
makes sense. Alright, that's it for now, man. That's Coffee
with Kaizen #6 in the books. And the next episode, I'm going

107
00:11:31.550 --> 00:11:35.920
to teach you six words that are stronger than "bad". Peace.

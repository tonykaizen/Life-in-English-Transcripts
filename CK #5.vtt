Tony Kaizen:
To listen is to respect.

2
00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:14.890
Good morning, my friend. This is Coffee with Kaizen #5. The
day is Wednesday, August 18th, 2021. And today we're talking

3
00:00:14.890 --> 00:00:22.510
about 8 simple words that you need to use in your next
argument or conflict to resolve the issue, the problem, the

4
00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:27.360
situation, whatever it is. Uh, if you want to read a
transcript of this episode, you can go to

5
00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:37.130
lifeinenglish.net/podcast/ck5. Now I know that link is very
long, so another thing that you can do is go to

6
00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:44.950
lifeinenglish.net/episodes and it will be the newest episode
on the list. And there you can read the transcript and also

7
00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:51.480
explanations of useful words and phrases and things like
that to get the complete experience and really learn with

8
00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:58.370
this episode and the concepts that we'll be talking about
today. But...let's not waste any more time. Let's get into

9
00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:04.990
this episode, man. So today I'm going to be sharing a short
little video from a man named Joseph Tan. He, I guess, is

10
00:01:04.990 --> 00:01:11.230
the owner of a consulting company called Good Monday
Consulting. I'll leave all of his information in the

11
00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:16.550
description. If you're watching this on YouTube or in the
show notes below the transcription, if you're looking at

12
00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:22.220
this on my website. And I really like this video because I
think it's something that a lot of us really need to

13
00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:27.820
understand. I've talked before about how listening can make
you a better speaker in any language, but I also think

14
00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:34.370
listening can make you a better person in so many ways. It
can help you do so many more things in life that you can

15
00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:38.910
never imagine, you know what I mean? And that's basically
what Joseph is gonna talk about today. So we're not going to

16
00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:44.420
waste any time. I'm going to play the clip, explain a couple
things to you, and, uh, we'll go from there, alright? So

17
00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.730
let's do it.

18
00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:52.740
Joseph Tan:
Conflict happens when I'm so full of my own perspective, my
own point of view. Thus, it is like being in a house with

19
00:01:52.740 --> 00:02:00.110
only one window. In order to resolve the conflict, I must
let in more light. Hence, my task is to create more windows

20
00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:07.440
and welcome in more light into the conversation so that
there's more light than heat. Here are 8 words to help you

21
00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:14.830
let in more light into your situation of conflict. Here are
the 8 words: "Help me see where you are coming from." Let me

22
00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:21.910
say it again, "Help me see where you are coming from." Then
you shut up and listen.

23
00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:27.990
To listen doesn't mean you agree, but to listen is to
respect. If you are humble enough, differences in

24
00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:32.840
perspective will not lead to conflict. It will only lead to
enlightenment. Think about it.

25
00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:41.680
Tony Kaizen:
So before we move any further in the episode, I'm gonna take
this time to explain a couple words and phrases that he used

26
00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:46.640
during that clip, just so that the entire thing is clear to
you if you're just listening to this, alright? So the first

27
00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:54.390
word is "conflict". The main topic or the main idea of this
entire episode. So "conflict" is a serious disagreement or

28
00:02:54.510 --> 00:03:01.760
argument, typically one that lasts a long time, okay? Now,
next, he said "full of". You know, conflict happens when I'm

29
00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:08.510
so full of my perspective, my thoughts, my point of view
that I don't have any space for the thoughts or perspective

30
00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:16.210
of someone else. So when we say "full of", full of means
containing or holding as much or as many as possible, having

31
00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:22.430
no empty space, so think of a glass of water. Eventually, if
you keep pouring water into the cup, it's going to be full.

32
00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:27.710
There will be no more space for any more water. So he's
using it figuratively in this case by saying I'm so full of

33
00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:33.790
my own perspective that there's no space for any difference
of opinion, any different perspective or different way of

34
00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:40.930
seeing things. Now, the next one is "perspective" or "point
of view". And "perspective" is just a particular attitude

35
00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:46.900
toward or a way of regarding or looking at something. So
it's the way that you see something- that's your

36
00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:53.170
perspective, alright? So in a conflict, many times you're
not even interested in seeing things in a different way or

37
00:03:53.170 --> 00:04:00.080
seeing things from that person's perspective or point of
view. Now, next, this one is, uh, advanced and really kind

38
00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:05.410
of formal, and I wouldn't even recommend that you use this
word, but you will hear it from time to time. So I just want

39
00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:09.780
you to understand it. It's the word "thus". T-H-U-S.

40
00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:17.430
"Thus". And this means as a result or consequence of this.
Or you could say "therefore". That's another way of saying

41
00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:24.030
"thus", it's "therefore". So in this case, when he says
"thus", he's saying conflict happens when I'm so full of my

42
00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:31.880
own perspective and point of view, therefore, or as a result
of this or as a consequence of this, it's like being in a

43
00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:38.040
house with only one window. I can only have one perspective
and there's not much light in the house. That's the idea.

44
00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:45.690
The next word is "resolve". Now, maybe you know what this
means, but "resolve" just means to settle or find a solution

45
00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:53.280
to a problem, a dispute, a conflict or something like that.
So you might hear the word resolve or conflict or end a

46
00:04:53.280 --> 00:05:00.750
conflict or find a solution to a conflict. In my opinion,
they all have the same idea. Now, the next word is "hence",

47
00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:09.200
which is very similar to "thus". The word "hence",
H-E-N-C-E, means as a consequence or for this reason. So

48
00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:16.490
when he says in order to resolve the conflict, I must let in
more light, hence my task is to create more windows. He's

49
00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:24.410
saying my duty or my responsibility is to let more light
into the house. Therefore, or because of this, or as a

50
00:05:24.410 --> 00:05:32.280
result of this, as a consequence, for this reason, I must
create more windows to let more light in. This is another

51
00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:36.960
one of those words that, in my opinion, is pretty formal.
You don't hear people say this every day, or at least I

52
00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:42.750
don't hear people say this every day. I see it as much more
formal English. But, now you should have an idea of what it

53
00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:48.730
means the next time you hear it. But, I would say, don't
worry about including this in your vocabulary. The words

54
00:05:48.730 --> 00:05:55.430
"thus" or "hence", because in my experience we just don't
speak like that on a daily basis, okay? But now you should

55
00:05:55.430 --> 00:06:03.070
have an idea of what they mean. So, next on the list is
"welcome in". To welcome in. Now, "to welcome" means to

56
00:06:03.070 --> 00:06:10.600
greet someone in a polite, warm and friendly way, right?
When you welcome somebody into your house or your country or

57
00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:17.350
the party, you're happy to see them and you welcome them in.
You receive them in a warm and friendly way. So when he's

58
00:06:17.350 --> 00:06:23.650
saying "welcome in more light" or "welcome in a different
perspective", it's the same idea, just figuratively. So, be

59
00:06:23.740 --> 00:06:31.270
open to a different perspective, a different light to shine
on this issue or this problem or this misunderstanding that

60
00:06:31.270 --> 00:06:34.190
we're having. Now, the 8 words.

61
00:06:35.150 --> 00:06:42.710
The 8 magic words to resolve this conflict. Help me see
where you are coming from. Now, what I want to explain here

62
00:06:42.760 --> 00:06:49.380
is the words "coming from" when we use them together. So if
you say to someone you know or you see where they're coming

63
00:06:49.380 --> 00:06:57.020
from, what you mean is that you understand why that person
has a particular opinion or perspective, even though in most

64
00:06:57.020 --> 00:07:02.890
cases you don't agree with their opinion or their
perspective. So, we have an argument or a conflict or some

65
00:07:02.890 --> 00:07:08.590
type of misunderstanding. And I say, "Help me see where
you're coming from", because we clearly have a difference of

66
00:07:08.590 --> 00:07:13.990
opinion. And then you explain to me what you think. You
explain to me your perspective and your opinion and things

67
00:07:13.990 --> 00:07:20.450
like that. And I don't agree, but I understand. So in that
case, I would say, "I see where you're coming from." I see

68
00:07:20.450 --> 00:07:26.910
your viewpoint, your perspective. I see why you would think
that, okay? It makes sense to me, why you would think those

69
00:07:26.910 --> 00:07:33.230
things, even though I don't agree. So I disagree. But I see
where you're coming from, okay? It's a very useful phrase.

70
00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:39.630
Alright, next is "shut up". I'm sure you've heard this at
some point, if you've been learning English for any amount

71
00:07:39.630 --> 00:07:46.710
of time. But let me just...explain it just in case. "Shut
up" is a rude way of telling someone to stop talking, to be

72
00:07:46.710 --> 00:07:54.070
quiet. So when he says, "After you ask somebody to help them
see where you're coming from, you'd shut up". Stop talking,

73
00:07:54.520 --> 00:08:01.120
be quiet and just listen to what they have to say. Don't
interrupt. Don't try to talk over them. Don't try to do

74
00:08:01.170 --> 00:08:07.920
anything of the sort. Be silent and just listen. Just be
receiving of their message, welcome it in and consider it,

75
00:08:08.200 --> 00:08:13.130
right? He says, "If you're humble enough". "Humble".

76
00:08:13.320 --> 00:08:21.820
H-U-M-B-L-E. Humble is having or showing a modest or low
estimation of one's own importance. And that doesn't mean

77
00:08:21.820 --> 00:08:26.150
that you don't think you're important. It doesn't mean that
you have low self-esteem. It doesn't mean that you don't

78
00:08:26.150 --> 00:08:32.050
think highly of yourself. In my opinion, it's two different
things. I just think it's not overestimating your

79
00:08:32.050 --> 00:08:38.090
importance. To me, that's what being humble is. It's
understanding you are no more important than anyone else.

80
00:08:38.440 --> 00:08:44.970
You are no more significant or interesting or powerful or
intelligent, and you might be, let's, I mean, let's be for

81
00:08:44.970 --> 00:08:51.780
real, that... it's...it's all relative, right? But being
"humble" is understanding that you're just...you're just

82
00:08:51.780 --> 00:08:57.630
another person, just like everybody else. So for that
reason, you should be giving everybody else the same respect

83
00:08:57.940 --> 00:09:03.220
and consideration that you expect to receive because you're
no better than anybody else just for being you, you know?

84
00:09:04.630 --> 00:09:11.180
Anyway, when he says "humble enough", maybe that doesn't
make sense to you. If you're "humble enough", disagreements

85
00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:13.720
should not lead into conflict.

86
00:09:13.800 --> 00:09:22.990
For example, when he says "humble enough", he's saying if
you have a sufficient level of humility, right? So many

87
00:09:22.990 --> 00:09:28.940
times we'll use this word "enough" in that way, you know,
like if you're hungry enough, then you'll actually go get

88
00:09:28.940 --> 00:09:34.250
some food. You won't just sit down and complain that you're
hungry. Once you are hungry enough, you will go get some

89
00:09:34.250 --> 00:09:40.880
food. Once you feel a sufficient level of hunger, you will
go get some food. So just understand that word "enough"

90
00:09:41.300 --> 00:09:49.540
after an adjective is describing a sufficient level of,
okay? Hopefully that makes sense. Now, last word on the list

91
00:09:49.540 --> 00:09:56.680
is "enlightenment". Enlightenment is the action or state of
attaining or having attained spiritual knowledge or insight.

92
00:09:56.980 --> 00:10:02.880
And to enlighten, which is the verb, means to give someone
greater knowledge and understanding about a subject or a

93
00:10:02.880 --> 00:10:07.820
situation. So we're really talking about that second
definition because we're not really referring to spiritual

94
00:10:07.820 --> 00:10:14.100
knowledge here. So when we say "enlightenment", you know,
conversation, understanding, considering the other person's

95
00:10:14.100 --> 00:10:19.710
perspective doesn't or shouldn't lead to conflict, it should
only lead to enlightenment. It should only lead to you

96
00:10:19.710 --> 00:10:25.500
having a greater knowledge and understanding about the way
this person sees the world, the way this person sees that

97
00:10:25.500 --> 00:10:31.860
particular situation, the way this person sees you. And
themselves, okay? That's the whole point of having a

98
00:10:31.860 --> 00:10:35.480
discussion, not to win or to lose, right?

99
00:10:35.760 --> 00:10:40.730
Because that's pointless. It's a waste of time. But to gain
some type of understanding at the end of the day, that's the

100
00:10:40.730 --> 00:10:47.440
point, right? So it took longer than I expected to play the
video and to explain the vocabulary, the phrases and the

101
00:10:47.440 --> 00:10:52.550
ideas and things like that. But I'm really interested in
this subject, so I might go deeper into this on the Life in

102
00:10:52.550 --> 00:10:57.690
English podcast at some point. But, I still like to leave
you with what I believe was one of the most important

103
00:10:57.690 --> 00:11:04.930
points, which is: "To listen, is to respect." In my opinion,
it's becoming less and less common to listen to other

104
00:11:04.930 --> 00:11:11.160
people, which means it's becoming less and less common to
respect other people. What you got to remember, what you got

105
00:11:11.160 --> 00:11:16.340
to understand is that if you only listen to yourself, if
you're only talking all the time, you're not learning

106
00:11:16.340 --> 00:11:22.150
anything new. You don't learn anything by talking. You learn
by listening. So what does that mean? That means that if

107
00:11:22.150 --> 00:11:26.520
you're only talking, talking, talking, if you're never
listening to other people, considering other people's

108
00:11:26.520 --> 00:11:32.690
perspectives, you are getting dumber by the day. That's
what's happening. By never listening to other people, by

109
00:11:32.690 --> 00:11:39.460
never considering other perspectives, points of views, ways
of seeing the world, possibilities and things like that, by

110
00:11:39.460 --> 00:11:44.540
never showing the other person respect and just listening to
what they have to say, you are literally getting dumber.

111
00:11:44.540 --> 00:11:49.950
You're getting dumber because you don't know everything,
you're not always right. Even though you may think you're

112
00:11:49.950 --> 00:11:56.780
hot shit, you're just not, okay? So, be humble, show some
respect and just listen.

113
00:11:57.870 --> 00:11:58.570
You might learn something.

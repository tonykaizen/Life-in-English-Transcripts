00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:06.580
What's up, Life in English family? This is the Life in
English podcast. I'm your host, Tony Kaizen. I was sitting

2
00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:13.410
here doing some studying and then watching some tutorials on
YouTube, and as always, before I watched the video, one of

3
00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:21.100
the pre-rolled ad comes on -- somebody trying to sell me
some shit -- and instinctively, I think most of us go for

4
00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:26.220
the "skip ad" button. It doesn't matter what's on the
screen, we're just watching the clock, counting down - five,

5
00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:31.890
four, three, two..."you may skip this ad now," and we skip
that shit. Fuck it! I just wanna watch my video. Get the

6
00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:39.930
fuck off my screen with these ads. Now, two things I want to
share with you today. The first one is from the perspective

7
00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:48.150
of a creator, and what I encourage you to do is to watch
those ads. Let me tell you why. Whatever content you're

8
00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:53.930
watching on YouTube or any other platform that was created
by an individual that's not being backed by some giant

9
00:00:53.930 --> 00:01:01.720
corporation or media company, each one of those videos took
a lot of time and effort to make, my friend. And you might

10
00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:06.750
assume, "Oh, well, it's got 50,000 views. He's already
making a lot of money with every video. I don't need to

11
00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:12.480
watch the ad." Yes, you do. Yes, you do. Because if everyone
thought like that, nobody would watch the fucking ads and

12
00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:17.280
the creator wouldn't get paid. A lot of people think just
because it has a million views, that means he made

13
00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:25.220
$1,000,000 on that video. But if the people don't watch the
ad, nobody's getting paid.And if everybody's skipping all

14
00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:31.850
the ads, nobody's getting paid, bro. You understand? So
support your favorite creators, support your favorite

15
00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:37.750
English teachers, support all independent...I mean support
the people that you love, and appreciate, and that make a

16
00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:44.460
difference in your life. Support them, bro. 30 seconds or 2
minutes of your time is nothing in comparison to what it

17
00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:49.630
would do for the person who created the fucking video you're
about to watch that is either gonna educate or entertain

18
00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:56.980
you. Watch the ad. And it's so funny, man, cos my
nine-year-old nephew understands how to skip YouTube ads

19
00:01:56.980 --> 00:02:03.550
better than me. He was over here a couple of weeks ago and
we were using his PlayStation to watch videos on YouTube and

20
00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:10.600
we were trying to watch a video. The ad came up and
immediately, he clicked on a few buttons and skipped an

21
00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:16.030
"unskippable" ad. I was like, "How the fuck you do that?"
And he showed me. He was like, "You press these buttons and

22
00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:21.010
this button for this reason and you won't see ads for a
little bit, and they won't show you ads like that anymore."

23
00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:29.310
I was like, "Holy shit." And it dawned on me, bro. It dawned
on me. People are getting smarter and smarter. These kids

24
00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:34.650
are learning how to skip ads that are not meant to be
skipped. And what that means is if you're trying to be a

25
00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:40.700
creator, specifically on YouTube or any other social media
platform hoping that your content will be monetized, you

26
00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:47.790
need to understand just trying to rely on ad revenue alone
is a terrible strategy. It's so two-dimensional, bruh, you

27
00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:54.380
gotta get a little more robust in your revenue or your
business model, you know what I'm saying? Just trying to

28
00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:59.640
rely on ad revenue is something that I don't recommend just
because it's so inconsistent and unreliable. You never know

29
00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:07.660
if it's gonna continue to be there. And if it is, you never
know how much it's gonna be, right? But anyway, to all you

30
00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:14.410
viewers and content consumers out there, please support your
favorite creators. I don't...I can't speak for all of them,

31
00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:21.660
but I can speak for many of them when I say we are all
working extremely hard to provide you guys with valuable

32
00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:29.750
content. Most of the time for fucking free, right? You pay
$10 a month for Netflix, but you won't pay your favorite

33
00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:36.960
creator five bucks a month so that they can keep making your
favorite content is fucking bonkers to me. But you know I'm

34
00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:41.690
not mad or judging anyone; that's not the point here. I'm
just trying to put things in perspective for you. Money has

35
00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:46.330
to come from somewhere, bruh, and if you're not going to pay
money, the least you can do for your favorite creator -- not

36
00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:51.790
for everyone, but for your favorites, the one you want to
see succeed -- watch the fucking ads, man! Do whatever

37
00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:58.360
simple thing they're asking you to do that will take 2
minutes of your time or $5 from your year, and support them,

38
00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:01.590
man. Everybody needs support. Alright?

39
00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:08.590
Now, from the other perspective, the second thing I wanted
to share from the perspective of a consumer. Now I'm

40
00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:15.540
speaking to the creators - what this all means, people are
skipping ads more than ever before. We're seeing more ads

41
00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:21.910
than ever before cos everybody is just trying to make a
quick buck but everything's getting commoditized. The

42
00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:28.140
Internet is just crushing all that nonsense. And the only
thing that's going to be left is your brand. This is

43
00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:32.770
something that Gary Vee made very clear to me, and I not
only understand it, I believe it, but that's besides the

44
00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:39.350
point. To all you creators out there that want to monetize
your work or wanna make money off ad revenue or whatever it

45
00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:47.030
is, you've got to understand, we are starting to become...we
have already become blind and deaf to senseless ads that

46
00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:52.550
want nothing more than our email so we can download the
bullshit e-book so you can retarget us with your email

47
00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:59.370
marketing until we buy your course or whatever bullshit.
We're tired of it. We're skipping it as soon as we see it.

48
00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:00.760
Stop trying it.

49
00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:08.050
Provide value first, then ask for money, not the other way
around. That's what that means to me. What it also means is

50
00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:14.710
that you got to focus on creating your brand. You got to
focus on making your content, your product, your service,

51
00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:23.060
your whatever, so fucking good that it does not matter if
you get ad revenue or not. You see what I'm saying? You need

52
00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:30.550
to make your shit so good that even if every person who
watches your video skips the ad, you'll still be creating

53
00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:38.200
enough value for it to come back to you in some way, even if
not immediately. Right? A video so valuable that maybe you

54
00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:43.990
don't get paid for it today, but you raise so much awareness
around you and your work and your brand that other

55
00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:50.420
opportunities you had never even imagined just start falling
into your lap. That's what you do. I think it's so good they

56
00:05:50.420 --> 00:05:58.050
can't ignore you; make it so good that they want to watch
the ads just so you can get paid. That's what made me...I

57
00:05:58.190 --> 00:06:03.100
stopped what I was doing just to record this episode,
because I'm sitting here about to watch this tutorial from a

58
00:06:03.100 --> 00:06:10.430
great teacher, the Net Ninja on YouTube, just in case you
were wondering, and the ads came up and I immediately just

59
00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:15.670
grabbed my phone and said, "I'm going to let the ads play so
he can get at least a little bit of money." I don't know how

60
00:06:15.670 --> 00:06:21.620
much it is, but I want him to get something. It's nothing
for me to sit here and check my notifications for two or

61
00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:29.060
three minutes while the ads run and he gets his money and I
can get back to my fucking free education that he took who

62
00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:38.990
knows how much time to prepare, and record, and edit, and
upload, and share with me for free. So consumers, please,

63
00:06:38.990 --> 00:06:45.480
if you support the creator or the business, the person,
whatever, watch the ads. I mean that literally and

64
00:06:45.480 --> 00:06:54.670
metaphorically. Creators, entrepreneurs, business owners,
artists, please stop trying to make the quick dollar and

65
00:06:54.670 --> 00:07:02.990
thinking short term. Invest in yourself and your craft, your
product or your service, your brand, and give so much value

66
00:07:03.510 --> 00:07:09.740
to your followers, your audience, your customers or the
world that even if you can't monetize your content, the

67
00:07:09.740 --> 00:07:17.880
value is going to come back to you in some way, shape or
form. Those are my recommendations...my recommendation.

68
00:07:20.210 --> 00:07:26.330
Oh, man, I want it to end, like, super smooth and just get
out of here but I fucked up the last line. But anyway, my

69
00:07:26.330 --> 00:07:33.910
friends, those are my recommendations to content creators
and content consumers alike.

70
00:07:34.420 --> 00:07:38.810
Please let me know what you think. Join the Discord Server.
The link will be in the description. Let's start a

71
00:07:38.810 --> 00:07:45.420
conversation, man. I want to know what you guys think about
this, because I really don't think that this gets talked

72
00:07:45.420 --> 00:07:52.210
about enough, both sides of the content creation process -
from the perspective of a creator and a consumer or

73
00:07:52.210 --> 00:07:58.260
business, from the perspective of the owners and operators
and the customers, you know? There's a lot of blindness or a

74
00:07:58.370 --> 00:08:04.460
huge lack of communication that goes on between both sides.
And now that I've been on both sides to some degree, you

75
00:08:04.460 --> 00:08:12.490
know, I just see things in such a different way than I did
five, ten or 15 years ago. You know? But anyway, that's all

76
00:08:12.490 --> 00:08:20.180
I got for you today, man. So please watch those fucking ads.
And creators, please invest more into your craft to make

77
00:08:20.180 --> 00:08:28.540
better shit so that the fucking ads don't even matter,
alright? Please. And support your favorite English teacher.

78
00:08:28.540 --> 00:08:35.450
Goddamn it.

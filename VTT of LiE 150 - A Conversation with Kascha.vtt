00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:04.710
Tony Kaizen:
So the first question for you is if you had to listen to
three albums for the rest of your life, and only three,

2
00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:05.970
which albums would they be?

3
00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:08.200
Kascha:
Oooh, that's a hard one!

4
00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:14.680
I listen to a lot of people, but a whole album? Let's
do...gotta say Beyonce.

5
00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:20.770
So I'm bringing it all the way back to maybe Dangerously in
Love. I can listen to that...that whole album.

6
00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:20.860
Tony Kaizen:
I see.

7
00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:29.030
Kascha:
Right, right, right. Classic. Classic. Um, who else? Drake,
Take Care. Um, who else?

8
00:00:29.030 --> 00:00:33.660
Let's see one more...an album...Throw out a name.

9
00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:35.680
Throw out a name. Um...

10
00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:39.780
Tony Kaizen:
A name? Kendrick. Kirk Franklin.

11
00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:40.400
Adele...

12
00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:47.800
Kascha:
Oh, Kirk. What album was that? If we wanna bring in gospel,
the album with melodies of...Melodies from Heaven.

13
00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:50.120
Tony Kaizen:
Oh yeah, I'm not sure what you're talking about...

14
00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:54.990
Kascha:
That's old, too. I listen to a lot of, like, old stuff, like
old CDs. Nothing really new.

15
00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:55.890
Tony Kaizen:
I got you. But that's good, though.

16
00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:56.760
Kascha:
Those would be my three.

17
00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:59.740
Tony Kaizen:
Nice choice. Okay, so what are three things that you can't
live without?

18
00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:08.030
Kascha:
Music. Even if I could barely name three albums. I listen to
a lot of music, so I'll say music. Um, I love working out.

19
00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:11.680
Um, my puppies.

20
00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:13.230
I have two dogs so...

21
00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:14.050
Tony Kaizen:
What kind of dogs?

22
00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:20.590
Kascha:
One is Chihuahua and Pekingese. And then the other one, I
just adopted. He's so cute. I just named him Milo. I've only

23
00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:26.120
had him for, like, two weeks, um so I don't know what he is,
though. They didn't really tell me, but I think he's like

24
00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:28.150
Chihuahua and Terrier. But I'm not too sure.

25
00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:30.070
Tony Kaizen:
You adopted him from, like, a shelter or something?

26
00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:35.580
Kascha:
Mm-hmm. So, Fulton County, I don't know if you guys live
here in Atlanta, but they're in need of people to adopt the

27
00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:42.360
dogs. They had like five dogs in each cage, um but it's gone
down to like two or three per cage. But if you need a dog,

28
00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:43.270
please go adopt...

29
00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:43.500
Tony Kaizen:
Nice!

30
00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:45.200
Kascha:
Because yeah, they need homes.

31
00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:51.620
Tony Kaizen:
Okay, well, next question is, if all jobs and professions
paid the same amount of money and you could do any of them,

32
00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:52.540
which one would you do?

33
00:01:54.010 --> 00:02:01.440
Kascha:
Oh, to be honest with you, I would love to just give back to
people. Like if I can get paid to just give back or have

34
00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:06.070
like a non-profit where you actually get paid for it, I
would do that because that's really all I want to do is just

35
00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:07.400
give back and help people.

36
00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:13.350
Tony Kaizen:
Now, when you think of giving, what do you mean? Like, is it
time or possessions, money? What's your favorite way to

37
00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.560
give?

38
00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:15.880
Kascha:
Um, I would say money.

39
00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:19.530
I would also say, um, possessions as well.

40
00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:26.770
And it could be like food...like food, clothing. If I could
give shelting...I mean shelter to the homeless, um, I would

41
00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:33.130
do that, um...cos a lot of times, like, you know, how people
like have extra clothes and like things like that, like I'll

42
00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:36.790
literally, like pull over and be like, "You need something?"
I'll have like a trunk full of stuff.

43
00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:37.180
Tony Kaizen:
Hmm.

44
00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:41.430
Kascha:
I know, my friends would be like, "What are you doing just
letting 'em in your trunk?" But yeah, yeah.

45
00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:41.910
Tony Kaizen:
Interesting.

46
00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:42.650
Kascha:
I know, right?

47
00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:47.110
Tony Kaizen:
Where does...where does that desire to just give come from?
Has it always been like that since you were a kid or was

48
00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:48.380
that instilled in you by someone?

49
00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:57.330
Kascha:
Hmm...I honestly feel like we can't...there's things in life
that will happen to us that we can't control sometimes, and

50
00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:04.200
I feel like we should still treat everybody, you know, the
same, with love. Um, so I feel like I've kind of always been

51
00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:10.870
this way. Um, I don't think anything, like, really happened
for me to feel this way. But yeah, I just like giving back

52
00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:11.380
to people...

53
00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:12.520
Tony Kaizen:
Hmm, what about your parents...

54
00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:13.920
Kascha:
...yeah I want people to be happy.

55
00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:15.060
Tony Kaizen:
...your parents, are they the same way?

56
00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:21.370
Kascha:
Yes, my mom. My mom is very, very giving. Like she'll give
you the shirt off her back. Um, if there wasn't so much

57
00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:27.160
crime, we would actually allow people to, like, stay with us
and do things like that. But, you know, some people, you

58
00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:28.360
know, you just don't know. So...

59
00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:31.100
Tony Kaizen:
Yeah, especially these days, right?

60
00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:32.260
Kascha:
Yeah. It can be crazy.

61
00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:36.590
Tony Kaizen:
And speaking of that, have you ever found yourself in a
situation where you were giving just out of the goodness of

62
00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:39.080
your heart and people end up trying to take advantage of
that?

63
00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:41.580
Kascha:
Oh, that's a good one.

64
00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:50.780
I'm not gonna tell a story. But I will say people that are
closer to me or friends where you kind of give or let them

65
00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:57.020
have things, but they don't really reciprocate...reciprocate
it. And I had to learn that people know what they're doing.

66
00:03:57.320 --> 00:04:00.530
Like sometimes they're like, "Oh," Well, I used to give
people the benefit of the doubt, like, "No, she wouldn't do

67
00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:05.090
that." or "No, she's not just trying to take from me," but
there are people that do do that and that will just keep

68
00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:10.820
taking, taking, and taking, and not giving. Or when they
borrow money from you and you want that, you know, you're

69
00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:14.080
just like, "Okay, when you gonna pay me back?" And they're
like, "I'll get to it, I'll get to it." But then when you

70
00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:16.450
borrow money from them or need something, it's like, "Okay,
where's my money?"

71
00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:16.990
Tony Kaizen:
I need mine right now.

72
00:04:16.990 --> 00:04:22.240
Kascha:
Yeah, exactly. I'm like, "Oh, my goodness." Like, what? So
yeah, it could be tricky sometimes.

73
00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:27.650
Tony Kaizen:
But how do you react in those situations? Because at least
in my mind, if you're giving, at least the right way to

74
00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:31.720
give, it's like you don't really expect anything in return.
You're just doing it because you want to. So when people try

75
00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:34.370
to take advantage of your willingness to give, how does that
make you feel?

76
00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:46.820
Kascha:
Honestly, it makes me feel...it still makes me feel taken
advantage of. It just depends. I feel like you learn people.

77
00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:55.710
So although I'm not wanting anything in return, it's still
like...or that's something ungrateful, I'll say.

78
00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:56.010
Tony Kaizen:
Exactly.

79
00:04:56.090 --> 00:04:57.770
Kascha:
It's more like an ungrateful thing.

80
00:04:57.920 --> 00:04:58.020
Tony Kaizen:
Yeah.

81
00:04:58.190 --> 00:05:04.540
Kascha:
So I think gratitude kind of goes a long way for me. There's
some people that may not care but me, I'm like, "Okay, a

82
00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:05.340
thank you would be nice."

83
00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:07.080
Tony Kaizen:
Right, knowing that they're appreciating what you're
doing...

84
00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:11.160
Kascha:
Yeah. Just knowing that you appreciate it, because if you
don't appreciate it, then I don't have to do it. You know? I

85
00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:13.250
can help someone else that does appreciate it.

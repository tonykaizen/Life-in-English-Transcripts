GERALDO RIVERA:
Hip Hop! Hip Hop has done more damage to black and brown people than racism in the last 10 years.

2
00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:16.590
When you find the youngster, a Puerto Rican from the South Bronx

3
00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:22.390
Or a black kid from Harlem who has succeeded in life other than being the one-tenth

4
00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:28.300
Of one-tenth of 1% that make it in the music business, that's been a success in life,

5
00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:34.360
Walking around with his pants around his ass and with, you know, visible tattoos.

6
00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:40.110
Or, you know, it is this whole ethos. And I love Russell Simmons.

7
00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:43.630
He's a dear friend of mine, and I admire his business acumen.

8
00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:51.640
At some point, those guys have to cop to the fact that by encouraging this distinctive culture that is removed from the mainstream,

9
00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:59.870
They have encouraged people to be so different from the mainstream that they can't participate other than,

10
00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:05.770
You know, the racks and the garment center and those entry-level jobs, and I lament it, I really do.

11
00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:08.450
I think that it has been very destructive culturally.

12
00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:14.280

19
00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:52.240
Over the years, I've heard a lot of people say that rap music is the reason we have gang violence,

20
00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:59.910
Drug abuse, prostitution, low test scores, babies out of wedlock, sexually promiscuous people,

21
00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:05.930
A lack of respect for authority, a lack of morals and positive values, fatherless children.

22
00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:07.990
The list goes on and on.

23
00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:12.070
On the surface, this may seem like a relatively simple topic,

24
00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:18.700
But it's actually pretty complex because it involves a lot of history, culture, facts, and opinions.

25
00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:23.090
I'm not qualified to teach you all that because I don't even know half the story.

26
00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:26.650
So instead of trying to do that, let me give you a real example.

27
00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:33.070
Back in 2015, Kendrick Lamar performed his hit song 'Alright' at the BET Awards.

28
00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:38.950
And for those of you that don't know, B.E.T stands for Black Entertainment Television.

29
00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:45.030
The performance featured Kendrick rapping on top of a vandalized cop car while he sang his famous lyrics,

30
00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:48.290
Referencing the problem of police brutality in the U.S.

31
00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:53.610
KENDRICK LAMAR:
Wouldn't you know? We've been hurt, been down before, nigga

32
00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:58.110
When our pride was low. Lookin' at the world like, "Where do we go, nigga?"

33
00:02:58.440 --> 00:02:59.240
And we hate po-po

34
00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:02.600
Wanna kill us dead in the street for sure, nigga

35
00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:03.990
I'm at the preacher's door

36
00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:07.080
My knees gettin' weak and my gun might blow

37
00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:08.710
But we gon' be alright

38
00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:12.250
TONY KAIZEN:
This performance was seen by thousands, if not millions of people,

39
00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:17.390
And it naturally sparked a lot of debate about police brutality, the validity of Kendrick's lyrics,

40
00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:20.570
And whether or not he was sending the right message to his listeners.

41
00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:25.400
I'm going to play a clip of some Fox News anchors talking about Kendrick's performance,

42
00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:28.710
And I want you to pay attention to the points they make while critiquing him.

43
00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:33.380
NEWS ANCHOR 1:
Rapper Kendrick Lamar raised some eyebrows last night

44
00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:37.240
When he opened the BET Awards singing on top of a vandalized cop car.

45
00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:42.070
KENDRICK LAMAR:
Wouldn't you know? We've been hurt, been down before, nigga

46
00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:46.430
When our pride was low. Lookin' at the world like, "Where do we go, nigga?"

47
00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:47.420
And we hate po-po

48
00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:50.780
Wanna kill us dead in the street for sure, nigga

49
00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:52.110
I'm at the preacher's door

50
00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:55.060
My knees gettin' weak and my gun might blow

51
00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:57.010
But we gon' be alright

52
00:03:57.010 --> 00:03:57.730
NEWS ANCHOR 1:
Did you catch that?

53
00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:02.080
Lamar stated his views on police brutality with that line in the song quote

54
00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:06.850
"and we hate the po-po, want to kill us in the street, for sure." K.G.

55

NEWS ANCHOR 2:
Oh please, oh, I don't like it. I mean, you know, I don't like it. That's why you came to me.

56
00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:18.100
I get it. That's his right to express himself. Let the free market decide.

57
00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:22.610
Personally, it doesn't excite me. It doesn't turn me on. Doesn't interest me. I'm not feeling it.

58
00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:25.340
NEWS ANCHOR 1:
Geraldo, not helpful with those song lyrics.

59
00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:27.440
GERALDO RIVERA:
To say the least. Not helpful at all.

60
00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:34.250
This is why I say that hip hop has done more damage to young African-Americans than racism in recent years.

61
00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:36.760
This is exactly the wrong message.

62
00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:41.600
And then to conflate what happened in the church in Charleston, South Carolina,

63
00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:50.210
With these tragic incidents involving excessive use of force by cops is to equate that racist killer with these cops.

64
00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:55.100
It is so wrong. It is so counterproductive. It gives exactly the wrong message.

65
00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:59.820
It doesn't recognize that a city like Baltimore, where remember Freddie Gray?

66
00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:03.680
They've had a homicide a day since Freddie Gray, no one's protesting that.

67
00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:09.210
Baltimore, a tiny city, 7% the size of New York, has just as many murders as New York.

68
00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:12.720
You know, we've got to wake up at a certain point and understand what's going on.

69
00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:15.460
NEWS ANCHOR 1:
And the timing is everything, and this may be a little too soon.

70
00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:19.050
NEWS ANCHOR 3:
The thing I was thinking about this, too, it's not like it was somebody on cable news

71
00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:22.850
Who just happened to say something that they regretted and that they had to go then apologize for.

72
00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:28.880
This was planned. There were probably a thousand people, at least several hundred,

73
00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:31.450
If not a thousand people who all knew that this was all going to happen.

74
00:05:31.450 --> 00:05:35.510
And nobody raises their hand and says, "maybe this isn't the best idea to do today".

75
00:05:35.510 --> 00:05:37.410
NEWS ANCHOR 1:
What's going on, Tommy? Look at that police car.

76
00:05:37.410 --> 00:05:38.360
NEWS ANCHOR 2:
It incites violence!

77
00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:41.720
NEWS ANCHOR 4:
You sure it was planned? It looks like a spontaneous demonstration to me.

78
00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:45.610
A rapper who's anti-police? I mean, it's never happened before.

79
00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:47.280
NEWS ANCHOR 1:
Let's move on to this one.

80
00:05:48.190 --> 00:05:51.620
TONY KAIZEN:
All right. So just in case you had a hard time following the conversation there,

81
00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:55.290
Let me summarize everything that was said in five main points.

82
00:05:56.090 --> 00:05:59.970
Number one, this message is wrong and counterproductive.

83
00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:06.710
Number two, we must remember that black people kill black people more than racist cops do.

84
00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:09.830
And no one is protesting or talking about that.

85
00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:17.690
Number three, this was premeditated and no one stopped it, and therefore it is unforgivable.

86
00:06:18.910 --> 00:06:23.720
Number four, a performance or a message like this incites violence.

87
00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:27.770
And number five, well, number five isn't really a point,

88
00:06:27.890 --> 00:06:36.130
But the person who had the last word during that segment sarcastically or ironically said it's nothing new to find a rapper who hates the police.

89
00:06:36.130 --> 00:06:41.730
And we're going to come back to each of these points in just a minute because the story doesn't end there.

90
00:06:42.530 --> 00:06:45.090
Kendrick Lamar eventually heard about the Fox News segment.

91
00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:50.920
So here's a clip from an interview he did with TMZ responding to the comments made by the news anchors.

92
00:06:52.030 --> 00:06:55.320
KENDRICK LAMAR:
How can you take a song that's about hope and turn it into hatred?

93
00:06:55.970 --> 00:07:01.270
You know what I'm saying? The message, the overall message is we're going to be all right.

94
00:07:01.550 --> 00:07:03.610
It's not the message of I want to kill people.

95
00:07:03.700 --> 00:07:07.840
I want to express myself in a positive light the same way other artists are doing.

96
00:07:08.150 --> 00:07:11.290
Not going out in the streets, going to the booth and talking about the situation,

97
00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:19.090
You know, and hoping these kids can find some type of influence on it and in a positive manner.

98
00:07:19.740 --> 00:07:25.110
TONY KAIZEN:
As you can see, Kendrick feels that the news anchors completely misinterpreted the message of the song.

99
00:07:26.200 --> 00:07:31.300
There wasn't a single line in the song that said, "Kill the police" or "Go commit violent crimes".

100
00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:38.200
In fact, it's the exact opposite. He's saying even though we have to deal with things like poverty,

101
00:07:38.520 --> 00:07:41.870
Gang violence, and police brutality, we're going to be all right.

102
00:07:43.500 --> 00:07:48.190
So two years later, in 2017, Kendrick dropped his fourth studio album, Damn.

103
00:07:49.090 --> 00:07:55.130
The second song on the album, DNA features the audio from that Fox News segment of Geraldo Rivera

104
00:07:55.180 --> 00:07:59.970
Saying that hip hop has done more damage than racism in recent years.

105
00:08:00.860 --> 00:08:04.930
KENDRICK LAMAR:
I got loyalty, got royalty inside my DNA (This is why I say that hip hop)

106
00:08:04.930 --> 00:08:07.950
I got loyalty, got royalty inside my DNA (Has done more damage to young African Americans)

107
00:08:07.950 --> 00:08:10.290
I live a better life, I'm rollin' several dice, fuck your life (Than racism in recent years)

108
00:08:10.530 --> 00:08:12.310
TONY KAIZEN:
In the third song on the album, YAH,

109
00:08:12.710 --> 00:08:17.330
You can hear Kendrick taking a direct shot at Geraldo Rivera in the second verse of the song.

110
00:08:19.220 --> 00:08:22.630
KENDRICK LAMAR:
Interviews wanna know my thoughts and opinions.

111
00:08:22.630 --> 00:08:25.550
Fox News wanna use my name for percentage.

112
00:08:25.780 --> 00:08:29.370
My latest muse is my niece, she worth livin'.

113
00:08:29.460 --> 00:08:32.820
See me on the TV and scream: "That's Uncle Kendrick!"

114
00:08:34.770 --> 00:08:35.850
Yeah, that's the business

115
00:08:35.850 --> 00:08:38.810
Somebody tell Geraldo this nigga got some ambition

116
00:08:39.460 --> 00:08:42.720
I'm not a politician, I'm not 'bout a religion

117
00:08:43.280 --> 00:08:45.440
TONY KAIZEN:
With Kendrick being one of the world's biggest artists,

118
00:08:45.670 --> 00:08:50.590
It didn't take long for Geraldo Rivera to hear about his name being mentioned in one of Kendrick's songs.

119
00:08:51.350 --> 00:08:56.490
He decided to respond to Kendrick's lyrics by clarifying what he meant to say that day on Fox News.

120
00:08:57.830 --> 00:08:59.450
GERALDO RIVERA:
I have no beef with Kendrick Lamar.

121
00:08:59.720 --> 00:09:06.670
I think that Kendrick Lamar is, as I said, along with Drake, the most talented hip-hop artist,

122
00:09:06.900 --> 00:09:08.270
Rapper, whatever you want to call it.

123
00:09:09.350 --> 00:09:14.530
Maybe the biggest problem I had with my original statements about How that's why I say

124
00:09:14.530 --> 00:09:18.100
Hip hop has done more damage to young African-Americans than racism in recent years.

125
00:09:18.350 --> 00:09:22.610
The problem with a statement like that, though true, is that it is too general,

126
00:09:23.320 --> 00:09:26.790
And I don't want to smear everybody or tar everybody with the same brush.

127
00:09:27.550 --> 00:09:29.770
I say, and Kendrick Lamar is a great artist.

128
00:09:30.310 --> 00:09:33.680
But if your symbolism is all going to be,

129
00:09:34.140 --> 00:09:42.230
"the cops are bad and we are the victims of bad cops and we have no chance because of bad cops or the system being stacked against us."

130
00:09:42.590 --> 00:09:47.500
That's self-defeating attitude... It's not going to do you any good.

131
00:09:47.500 --> 00:09:51.730
It's not going to do your brothers and sisters any good. It's not going to do your kids any good.

132
00:09:53.910 --> 00:10:02.290
You have to take responsibility for yourself. Do the best you can, be practical, be hardworking.

133
00:10:05.860 --> 00:10:10.890
And again, I have no beef with Kendrick Lamar, anyone else in the business.

134
00:10:11.950 --> 00:10:17.670
TONY KAIZEN:
So just in case you had difficulty following that little piece of the episode,Let me summarize what Geraldo said.

135
00:10:19.100 --> 00:10:22.930
This message that the cops are bad, you know, and we, as black people,

136
00:10:22.970 --> 00:10:28.380
Are the victims and we have no chance because of these racist cops and, you know, the system is against us.

137
00:10:28.990 --> 00:10:34.840
That self-defeating attitude won't do you any good. You have to take responsibility.

138
00:10:35.290 --> 00:10:38.700
Do your best. Be practical and hardworking.

139
00:10:41.480 --> 00:10:43.260
So now that you've heard the entire story,

140
00:10:43.930 --> 00:10:49.770
Let's go back and analyze the critiques of the Fox News crew and many other Americans across this country.

141
00:10:50.810 --> 00:10:56.440
Number one, this message and this kind of performance are wrong and counterproductive.

142
00:10:57.840 --> 00:11:00.570
We've already kind of established and we heard from Kendrick himself,

143
00:11:00.610 --> 00:11:05.260
The message of the song is even though we have to deal with all these negative things, gang violence,

144
00:11:05.260 --> 00:11:13.150
Police brutality, poverty, no options, you know, no education, we're still going to be all right.

145
00:11:13.930 --> 00:11:15.020
That's the message of the song.

146
00:11:15.310 --> 00:11:18.760
So I guess I might ask you or anyone,

147
00:11:19.230 --> 00:11:23.130
How is this message wrong or counterproductive if you're interpreting it correctly?

148
00:11:24.010 --> 00:11:24.640
You see what I'm saying?

149
00:11:25.160 --> 00:11:28.720
And I guess you can understand the other perspective from the Fox News anchor saying,

150
00:11:30.340 --> 00:11:35.160
By saying we hate the police and we know they want to kill us and we have no chance everyone is against us,

151
00:11:35.980 --> 00:11:41.060
You're making it harder for black and white people to create some type of healthy relationship.

152
00:11:41.060 --> 00:11:46.770
You're making it harder for black people to move forward or overcome these difficulties that we face.

153
00:11:47.430 --> 00:11:52.840
I guess I can understand that perspective. I can understand that statement, let's say.

154
00:11:53.920 --> 00:11:57.390
But people talking about the reality that they have to deal with,

155
00:11:57.630 --> 00:12:02.530
That's different from yours, isn't wrong or counterproductive in any way.

156
00:12:02.640 --> 00:12:07.890
Because, again, the message of the song is even though this shit is going on, we're going to be all right.

157
00:12:09.100 --> 00:12:09.870
That's just my opinion.

158
00:12:10.850 --> 00:12:16.210
Point number two, we must remember that black people kill black people more than racist cops do,

159
00:12:16.490 --> 00:12:21.350
And no one is protesting that, no one is talking about that, no one is mad about that.

160
00:12:21.390 --> 00:12:25.560
Now, although that's true, that's 100% true,

161
00:12:25.560 --> 00:12:31.970
Black people kill black people more than racist cops kill black people. That statement is 100% true.

162
00:12:33.030 --> 00:12:37.560
However, it has absolutely nothing to do with the fact that there are racist cops killing black people.

163
00:12:38.670 --> 00:12:42.960
It's two completely different situations, two completely different problems.

164
00:12:43.130 --> 00:12:46.200
So what Kendrick was talking about in the song is police brutality,

165
00:12:46.690 --> 00:12:50.400
Racist cops targeting black and brown people and harassing them, beating them,

166
00:12:50.660 --> 00:12:53.190
Sending them to jail, and stuff like that.

167
00:12:54.190 --> 00:13:00.320
That has nothing to do with black people killing other black people or brown people killing other brown people.

168
00:13:00.320 --> 00:13:04.900
So it seems a bit disingenuous to bring that into the conversation when all you're really doing

169
00:13:04.900 --> 00:13:10.140
Is diverting the attention away from the real problem and trying to put it somewhere else

170
00:13:10.330 --> 00:13:14.290
So that we don't have to talk about the real problem. And again, that's my opinion.

171
00:13:15.600 --> 00:13:22.850
Number three, this performance was premeditated and no one stopped it. Therefore, it's unforgivable, right?

172
00:13:22.850 --> 00:13:25.340
That's really what I think this woman was trying to say.

173
00:13:26.810 --> 00:13:30.020
But I guess that's really just a question of opinion.

174
00:13:30.020 --> 00:13:32.150
I mean, of course, the performance was premeditated.

175
00:13:32.830 --> 00:13:37.720
But one of the great things about this country is everybody has the freedom to express themselves however they want.

176
00:13:38.040 --> 00:13:43.960
So in her mind, for her to think somebody should have raised their hand and said, "Yo, this is wrong. This cannot happen."

177
00:13:44.550 --> 00:13:48.360
It's a little silly to me because she has the right to sit up on Fox News

178
00:13:48.360 --> 00:13:52.500
And express her opinion about how she thinks it's wrong or counterproductive or unforgivable.

179
00:13:53.050 --> 00:13:57.380
But another individual doesn't have the right to go and express themselves.

180
00:13:58.530 --> 00:14:01.280
I think it's kind of hypocritical. I'd love to know what you think.

181
00:14:02.530 --> 00:14:03.690
Let's move on to point number four,

182
00:14:04.110 --> 00:14:08.040
Which is this performance of Kendrick on a vandalized cop car saying,

183
00:14:08.320 --> 00:14:10.440
"We hate the police, they want to kill us because we black".

184
00:14:11.390 --> 00:14:14.570
That type of thing incites violence, in their opinion.

185
00:14:15.490 --> 00:14:20.730
But the thing about violence is, you know, you can incite violence all you want,

186
00:14:20.730 --> 00:14:25.180
But unless the people decide to become violent, nothing happens.

187
00:14:26.890 --> 00:14:29.420
Like, imagine you're walking in the street, somebody walks up to you and says,

188
00:14:29.420 --> 00:14:30.700
"Hey, go kill that guy."

189
00:14:31.300 --> 00:14:33.080
"Hey, go punch that lady in the face."

190
00:14:33.720 --> 00:14:36.830
That's inciting violence. You're encouraging violent behavior.

191
00:14:37.250 --> 00:14:42.290
But unless I make the choice, or in this case you, unless you make the choice to go kill that guy

192
00:14:42.290 --> 00:14:44.340
Or punch that lady in the face nothing happens.

193
00:14:44.880 --> 00:14:48.560
So to put all the blame on Kendrick. First of all, he wasn't even inciting violence.

194
00:14:49.020 --> 00:14:51.210
He was just telling a story and sharing his opinion.

195
00:14:51.480 --> 00:14:53.090
But in your opinion, he's inciting violence.

196
00:14:53.090 --> 00:14:59.170
So even if that's the case until the crowd decides to become violent, nothing happens.

197
00:15:00.360 --> 00:15:04.890
So I think at some point we have to, like, talk about personal responsibility and understand,

198
00:15:05.390 --> 00:15:09.450
Even if I'm saying, "let's get violent" nothing happens unless you decide to get violent.

199
00:15:10.340 --> 00:15:13.160
You know? I don't know, it's my opinion.

200
00:15:13.310 --> 00:15:18.490
So number five, again, is not a point, but the news anchor sarcastically said,

201
00:15:18.490 --> 00:15:21.990
"Oh, a rapper who hates the police. That's nothing new. Give me a break."

202
00:15:23.110 --> 00:15:29.230
And that just makes me go back to point one, which is how is that comment correct or productive in any way?

203
00:15:29.550 --> 00:15:34.840
When you're sarcastically and arrogantly disregarding somebody's life experience.

204
00:15:35.060 --> 00:15:39.120
I mean, like, black people in many places around this country have to deal with police brutality,

205
00:15:39.770 --> 00:15:42.180
Racist officials, racist authority figures.

206
00:15:42.630 --> 00:15:43.750
And you're sarcastically saying,

207
00:15:43.750 --> 00:15:47.960
"Oh yeah, that's nothing new, huh? Oh, you hate the police? Wow. How novel?"

208
00:15:48.350 --> 00:15:53.690
I don't see how that comment in a conversation that, in your opinion, is supposed to be productive and healthy...

209
00:15:53.750 --> 00:16:00.050
I don't see how a comment like that is productive, healthy or helpful in any way when you're looking down,

210
00:16:00.050 --> 00:16:04.300
And sarcastically trying to disregard an experience that's completely different from yours.

211
00:16:04.650 --> 00:16:09.170
So again, it seems a little hypocritical, in my opinion.

212
00:16:10.550 --> 00:16:15.580
And then we go to the last clip I shared with you of Geraldo Rivera responding to Kendrick Lamar

213
00:16:15.580 --> 00:16:20.580
By saying "this self-defeating attitude and saying the cops are bad, the cops are racist.

214
00:16:21.190 --> 00:16:26.770
Everyone's against us. We have no chance. That kind of attitude and mentality won't serve you in any way.

215
00:16:27.320 --> 00:16:36.650
The solution is to take responsibility. Do your best. Be practical and be hardworking."

216
00:16:38.120 --> 00:16:41.150
I can't even keep a straight face when I say it, because, in his words,

217
00:16:41.750 --> 00:16:45.300
That is how you beat racism, that's how you overcome racism.

218
00:16:45.650 --> 00:16:50.490
That's how you overcome the fact that you have to deal with racist cops harassing you just because your skin is darker than theirs,

219
00:16:50.990 --> 00:16:52.970
Or just because you're from a different neighborhood than they are.

220
00:16:54.700 --> 00:17:01.240
Doing your best. Being practical and being hardworking is going to solve all those problems.

221
00:17:02.020 --> 00:17:07.600
Gang violence, drug abuse, no father at the house, racist cops harassing you,

222
00:17:08.720 --> 00:17:12.820
No opportunities to start businesses or get jobs, no real education.

223
00:17:13.100 --> 00:17:15.640
Just be practical and hardworking, and you'll be fine.

224
00:17:17.290 --> 00:17:21.140
That's what I understood, maybe that's not what he meant, but that's what I understood, right?

225
00:17:22.800 --> 00:17:24.180
But let me give you my final thoughts.

226
00:17:25.450 --> 00:17:28.790
There are a lot of rap songs out there that talk about doing very bad things to people

227
00:17:28.790 --> 00:17:33.510
Or living the lifestyle that can get you an STD, locked up, or killed.

228
00:17:35.180 --> 00:17:35.990
Rob me a nigga

229
00:17:37.090 --> 00:17:37.570
Pop That

230
00:17:38.450 --> 00:17:39.810
Druggys with the Hoes Again

231
00:17:40.680 --> 00:17:41.450
Lay It Down

232
00:17:42.090 --> 00:17:43.030
Wet Ass Pussy

233
00:17:44.520 --> 00:17:48.890
If you listen to some of the things they're saying in their songs, you'll notice it's some pretty graphic shit.

234
00:17:49.860 --> 00:17:53.880
Things that most parents hope their children never do or witness in their lifetimes.

235
00:17:55.060 --> 00:18:00.560
And the argument a lot of people are making here is that these rappers are glorifying very dangerous lifestyles in their music.

236
00:18:01.050 --> 00:18:05.610
Then the kids are listening to that music and then doing what they hear the rappers talking about in their songs.

237
00:18:06.780 --> 00:18:10.170
But the reality is these artists are just telling the stories about their lives.

238
00:18:11.200 --> 00:18:12.790
Real rap is all about storytelling.

239
00:18:14.060 --> 00:18:18.860
And the graphic stories being told in their music is or was a part of their reality.

240
00:18:19.880 --> 00:18:25.120
So even if some of these artists are in fact glorifying a lifestyle that you don't agree with or support,

241
00:18:25.470 --> 00:18:27.900
They still have every right to express themselves.

242
00:18:29.050 --> 00:18:33.800
It's up to the individual to decide whether or not they like what's being said in the songs.

243
00:18:34.820 --> 00:18:39.090
The individual decides what action they take after listening to the song.

244
00:18:40.550 --> 00:18:43.660
Like, I've heard the song Rob Me A Nigga hundreds of times,

245
00:18:43.920 --> 00:18:50.330
But I've not once thought about getting a pistol and committing an armed robbery, even when I had no money.

246
00:18:51.400 --> 00:18:56.020
Why? Because I make my own choices and I know my choices have consequences.

247
00:18:57.300 --> 00:19:03.500
So you can say, "Freddie Gibbs turned my son into a thug." "Cardi B turned my daughter into a hoe."

248
00:19:04.180 --> 00:19:06.870
And that might be true. I don't know for sure.

249
00:19:08.260 --> 00:19:11.290
What I do know is that there are certainly a lot of young people out there

250
00:19:11.290 --> 00:19:15.150
That only smoke weed and do drugs because they heard about it in a rap song.

251
00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:17.810
In fact, I'm probably included in that group.

252
00:19:19.160 --> 00:19:22.330
There are young people out there having unprotected sex with multiple people

253
00:19:22.650 --> 00:19:26.350
Because some rappers talk about that in a positive light in their songs.

254
00:19:27.630 --> 00:19:30.660
There are young people out there who walk around with their pants hanging off their ass

255
00:19:30.660 --> 00:19:32.900
Simply because their favorite rapper does the same thing.

256
00:19:34.170 --> 00:19:37.000
There are young people out there who fantasize about wearing gold chains,

257
00:19:37.270 --> 00:19:39.730
Driving fancy cars, and fucking somebody else's bitch

258
00:19:40.200 --> 00:19:43.340
Just because that's what their favorite rappers talk about in their songs.

259
00:19:44.680 --> 00:19:51.350
But even if that is the case, mom and dad, the question is who allowed all that to happen?

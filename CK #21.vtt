00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:02.250
We all have four wives.

00:00:04.609 --> 00:00:08.280
What's up, my friend?

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:10.470
This is Coffee with Kaizen number 21.

00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:13.530
And in this episode, I'm going to be sharing a story with you.

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:19.690
I saw this interesting clip on TikTok the other day of this man telling a story about four wives.

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:26.470
Now, unfortunately, I couldn't find the name of this man, or I don't know where this clip actually came from or anything like that.

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:30.790
All I was able to do was find the clip on YouTube so I could play it for you.

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:36.670
So I will put the link to this video in the show notes for this episode and in a description on YouTube.

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:43.030
But unfortunately, I can't really tell you much more about this story or this man, because I couldn't find any more information.

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:47.140
But at least I can share the story with you because it's pretty interesting and thought-provoking.

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:47.590
All right?

00:00:48.655 --> 00:00:50.905
I'm going to play the clip or the story for you.

00:00:50.905 --> 00:00:55.755
Then after that, I'll just explain a little bit of useful vocabulary and that'll be it for this episode.

00:00:55.765 --> 00:00:58.855
Now, like I always say, hopefully, it's a short one.

00:00:59.275 --> 00:01:03.055
But it seems like whenever I say that, the episode's like 20 or 30 minutes.

00:01:03.085 --> 00:01:03.385
All right.

00:01:03.385 --> 00:01:06.615
But we're going to see how this goes, and hopefully, you enjoy the story.

00:01:06.685 --> 00:01:06.925
All right.

00:01:06.925 --> 00:01:08.425
So let's not waste any more time.

00:01:08.695 --> 00:01:10.585
Let me play this story for you.

00:01:11.165 --> 00:01:11.535
Here we go.

00:01:14.305 --> 00:01:17.790
Once upon a time, there was a king with four wives.

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:22.620
One day, the king got sick and was on his death bed.

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:34.230
Afraid of being in the afterlife alone, he asked his fourth wife, which he loved the most, and bought her diamonds and gold and elegant clothing,

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:39.330
he asked her, "Would you die with me and go with me to the afterlife?"

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:43.030
The fourth wife replied, "I'm sorry, I can't do that."

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:43.770
and walked away.

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:50.940
He also loved his third wife and was very proud and would always show her off to neighboring kingdoms.

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:55.950
So he called on his third wife and asked, "Would you accompany me to the afterlife?"

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:00.570
The third wife replied, "I love my life too much.

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:03.150
And I'm sorry, I cannot go with you.

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:06.720
And when you die, I'm going to remarry."

00:02:07.854 --> 00:02:11.815
The second wife has always been there for him in his times of need.

00:02:12.445 --> 00:02:15.745
So he asked, "Would you accompany me to the afterlife?"

00:02:17.335 --> 00:02:27.924
The second wife then replied, "I'm sorry that I can't help you out this time,
but what I can do is arrange your funeral and I will be there for your funeral."

00:02:28.405 --> 00:02:35.605
A voice called out and said, "I'll leave with you and follow you wherever you go, even if it is to the afterlife."

00:02:38.095 --> 00:02:43.595
And it was his first wife, but this was the wife that he took care of the least.

00:02:44.555 --> 00:02:50.905
He felt embarrassed and said, "I'm sorry, I should have taken more care of you and given you more attention when I was alive."

00:02:51.325 --> 00:02:56.455
The moral of this story is that we all have four wives.

00:02:57.304 --> 00:02:59.915
Our fourth wife is our body.

00:03:00.875 --> 00:03:09.005
We like to decorate it with nice jewelry, nice clothing, but in the end, it can't follow us to the afterlife.

00:03:10.055 --> 00:03:13.234
The third wife represents our possessions.

00:03:13.715 --> 00:03:20.644
We spend so much time trying to gather possessions, but in the end they cannot follow us to the afterlife.

00:03:20.734 --> 00:03:26.184
They will be given to other people and divided just like the third wife said, she's going to remarry.

00:03:26.915 --> 00:03:29.584
The second wife, our friends and family.

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:31.800
We trust them.

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:39.600
They're always there for us in times of need, but the furthest they can go with us is to our funeral and send us off.

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:46.020
Our first wife, the first wife represents our soul.

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:50.790
We usually neglect taking care of our soul.

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:54.240
That is the thing that will follow us to the afterlife.

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:56.070
Care for your body.

00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:58.260
Keep it healthy.

00:03:58.959 --> 00:04:02.070
Enjoy your possessions and the comfort they provide.

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:06.480
Cherish your friends and family for the love that they provide.

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:11.190
But don't forget to take care of your soul, nourish your soul.

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:19.579
Take time to be alone, take time to pray, take time to meditate.

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:25.830
Because it is the source of all of your life and your most faithful friend.

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:29.370
I hope this story can help you or somebody that you love.

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:33.500
All right, y'all, that is a story about the king and the four wives.

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:38.359
Now, hopefully, you found it interesting or a little entertaining or hopefully, thought-provoking,

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:44.990
but all I'm going to do now is go through and talk about some of the useful vocabulary that this man used during his story

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:51.620
to hopefully help you understand the entire story and learn some things that you can use in your everyday conversations.

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:52.070
All right?

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:53.880
Let's get started.

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:58.710
The first one, the very first line of the story, 'once upon a time',

00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:06.270
this just means at some time in the past, and it's a very common, conventional way to start a story about the past.

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:10.440
Not so much when you're telling stories, like, to your friends and things like that,

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:16.470
but you'll hear a lot of times in fairytales or, um, fiction movies and things like that...

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:19.800
all movies are fiction, I guess, but you get the point.

00:05:20.099 --> 00:05:25.110
Like, more fantasy type stories, 'once upon a time in a foreign land' or something like that.

00:05:25.349 --> 00:05:28.169
It just means at some point in time, that's it.

00:05:28.349 --> 00:05:32.669
Now, we don't really speak that way in our daily conversations, but hopefully you get the point.

00:05:32.969 --> 00:05:33.270
All right.

00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:43.844
So the next one is 'got sick', which is the past tense of 'get sick' and to get sick just means to become sick or to become ill.

00:05:44.055 --> 00:05:45.675
Now, the reason I taught, you probably know that,

00:05:45.675 --> 00:05:51.975
but the reason I put that on the list is because this word get everybody's favorite verb because it means 20 different things.

00:05:52.275 --> 00:05:58.505
One of the most common meanings and uses for this word get is basically just a change in state.

00:05:59.085 --> 00:06:03.990
It could be a change in mental state or a change in physical state, a change in emotion or something like that.

00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:15.270
For example, to get sick, to become sick, to get mad, to become mad, to get hungry, to get taller, to get interested, whatever it is.

00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:18.075
You go from not being this thing to being this thing.

00:06:18.285 --> 00:06:25.335
So, just, essentially it means to become something, to change your state of mind, emotion, physical being or something like that.

00:06:25.545 --> 00:06:25.815
All right?

00:06:27.015 --> 00:06:27.285
All right.

00:06:27.285 --> 00:06:27.465
Cool.

00:06:27.465 --> 00:06:29.415
So next on the list is deathbed.

00:06:30.045 --> 00:06:35.665
Now, you probably can understand this just by hearing the words deathbed, but whenever we say deathbed,

00:06:35.685 --> 00:06:43.325
it just refers to, it's not always literally a bed, but most of the time it's the place where a person is laying right before they die.

00:06:43.925 --> 00:06:50.370
So a lot of times it's the hospital, but you'll hear in many conversations about death or older people talking about their life

00:06:50.760 --> 00:06:56.700
or us talking about how you don't want to be on your death bed with all this regret, which means you don't want to be

00:06:57.540 --> 00:07:02.420
in the last moments of your life, right before you die, thinking about all the things you regret.

00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:03.070
Okay?

00:07:03.070 --> 00:07:04.710
All right.

00:07:04.710 --> 00:07:05.970
Next is the afterlife.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:09.000
Another one of those terms that you probably understand just by hearing it,

00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:15.240
but the afterlife literally refers to life after death, your existence after death.

00:07:16.470 --> 00:07:20.430
The next word on the list is elegant, elegant, right?

00:07:20.490 --> 00:07:24.090
Elegant E L E G A N T elegant.

00:07:24.090 --> 00:07:27.960
And it just means pleasingly graceful and stylish in appearance.

00:07:28.590 --> 00:07:30.490
The next word on the list is replied.

00:07:31.110 --> 00:07:32.970
R E P L I E D.

00:07:32.970 --> 00:07:36.210
It's the past tense of reply, R E P L Y.

00:07:36.630 --> 00:07:41.160
And reply just means to say something in response to something that someone else has said.

00:07:41.490 --> 00:07:46.230
The reason I put that on the list is because there's more than one word to express this action.

00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:50.340
You can say reply, you can say respond, or you can say answer.

00:07:51.070 --> 00:07:51.330
Okay?

00:07:51.620 --> 00:07:54.915
I would say answer's probably the least formal, the most common,

00:07:55.875 --> 00:08:00.795
and then reply is a little more formal, respond is about the same level of formality as reply.

00:08:01.034 --> 00:08:08.205
And in this context, they all mean the same thing to, to say something in response to something that someone else has said.

00:08:08.505 --> 00:08:08.835
All right?

00:08:09.705 --> 00:08:09.914
All right.

00:08:09.914 --> 00:08:11.414
Next is walk away.

00:08:11.895 --> 00:08:19.650
Now, there is a very literal meaning of walk away which literally just mean
to use your feet to move away from someone or something, you're walking away.

00:08:19.920 --> 00:08:29.670
But in this context, it means to casually or irresponsibly withdraw from a situation in which one is involved or for which one is responsible.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.460
Now, that is a lot of words and it sounds very formal.

00:08:32.789 --> 00:08:35.549
So basically to walk away from something just means

00:08:35.549 --> 00:08:43.755
to decide that you are no longer going to care about or be responsible for one of your responsibilities.

00:08:44.025 --> 00:08:44.235
All right.

00:08:44.235 --> 00:08:47.955
So you might walk away from your children, which means you basically abandoned them.

00:08:47.955 --> 00:08:50.175
You don't care about that responsibility anymore.

00:08:50.355 --> 00:08:51.615
You walk away from your husband.

00:08:51.765 --> 00:08:57.165
You decide we're done, you're no longer my responsibility, I don't care about you anymore, I'm going to do my own thing.

00:08:57.165 --> 00:09:02.535
You have walked away from this person, not physically or literally, but more like figuratively.

00:09:02.565 --> 00:09:03.765
Hopefully you can understand that.

00:09:04.785 --> 00:09:06.765
So the next word on the list is proud.

00:09:07.785 --> 00:09:09.455
P R O U D proud,

00:09:09.635 --> 00:09:15.155
which is just a feeling of deep pleasure or satisfaction as a result of one's own achievements,

00:09:15.185 --> 00:09:20.045
qualities, or possessions, or those of someone with whom one is closely associated.

00:09:20.435 --> 00:09:21.545
Again, that's a lot of words.

00:09:21.545 --> 00:09:30.125
So when you think of proud, you can think of this deep sense of satisfaction for something that you have achieved, or a quality that you possess.

00:09:30.365 --> 00:09:32.765
Now, word that's very closely related is pride.

00:09:33.015 --> 00:09:34.405
So we feel proud.

00:09:35.045 --> 00:09:35.760
That's the adjective.

00:09:35.760 --> 00:09:37.230
I feel proud of something.

00:09:37.680 --> 00:09:40.350
Now pride is the feeling of being proud.

00:09:41.189 --> 00:09:42.180
Hopefully, that makes sense.

00:09:42.449 --> 00:09:42.720
Okay.

00:09:42.839 --> 00:09:49.439
So proud is the feeling or a proud is what you are, and pride is that feeling of being proud.

00:09:50.400 --> 00:09:51.450
I really hope that makes sense.

00:09:51.900 --> 00:09:52.170
All right.

00:09:52.170 --> 00:09:54.450
Next on the list is show her off.

00:09:54.480 --> 00:09:57.000
The king would like to show off his second or third wife.

00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:57.630
I can't remember.

00:09:57.840 --> 00:10:05.310
So to show off just means to, to really, to show someone off means to display someone or something that is a source of pride.

00:10:06.450 --> 00:10:09.120
A source of pride is something that makes you feel proud, right?

00:10:09.120 --> 00:10:15.300
So to show off your wife needs to take her around to all the, I don't know, the clubs, the bars, everywhere you go.

00:10:15.330 --> 00:10:20.550
You want everybody to see your beautiful, amazing wife, because you feel a sense of pride.

00:10:20.700 --> 00:10:22.320
You're proud that this woman is your wife.

00:10:22.620 --> 00:10:22.920
Okay.

00:10:24.030 --> 00:10:26.310
Next, neighboring kingdoms.

00:10:26.550 --> 00:10:27.810
The word here is neighboring.

00:10:27.840 --> 00:10:29.160
That's the word I want to explain.

00:10:29.580 --> 00:10:34.650
Neighboring just means next to, or very near another place or adjacent.

00:10:34.920 --> 00:10:40.680
Now, we use this word neighboring when we're talking not about just anything, like,

00:10:40.710 --> 00:10:48.090
I wouldn't say, uh, the TV is neighboring my desk or the light is neighboring the phone or anything like that.

00:10:48.330 --> 00:10:51.930
Normally, we're talking about, um, cities or communities.

00:10:52.110 --> 00:10:55.860
The neighboring city, the neighboring kingdom, the neighboring community

00:10:55.900 --> 00:11:00.810
means the community city or area next to my community, city or area.

00:11:01.200 --> 00:11:01.470
Okay.

00:11:02.580 --> 00:11:02.790
All right.

00:11:02.790 --> 00:11:05.250
Next is accompany, accompany.

00:11:06.045 --> 00:11:10.844
Accompany someone just means to go somewhere with someone as a companion or an escort.

00:11:10.844 --> 00:11:13.214
So would you accompany me to the store?

00:11:13.425 --> 00:11:16.545
It's a very formal way of saying, would you go with me to the store.

00:11:16.604 --> 00:11:18.765
To accompany someone just needs to go with someone.

00:11:19.005 --> 00:11:19.275
Okay.

00:11:19.574 --> 00:11:20.744
So let me repeat.

00:11:21.015 --> 00:11:25.140
It's a more formal way of saying to go with someone to someplace.

00:11:25.440 --> 00:11:25.710
All right.

00:11:26.850 --> 00:11:28.020
Next is remarry.

00:11:28.350 --> 00:11:33.420
Now you probably understand this, but just in case you don't to remarry simply means to get married again.

00:11:33.690 --> 00:11:39.570
So I married my first wife, we get divorced or she dies and then I get married again, which means I have remarried.

00:11:41.070 --> 00:11:44.020
Next word on the list is to be there for someone.

00:11:44.470 --> 00:11:52.604
To be there for him or her or them or me, to be there for someone just means to be available, to provide support or comfort for someone.

00:11:52.814 --> 00:11:55.724
And this is a very common expression, let's say.

00:11:56.025 --> 00:11:56.345
You know I..

00:11:56.474 --> 00:11:57.645
Can you be there for me?

00:11:57.645 --> 00:12:01.844
Or I was always there for her, which means I always showed her support.

00:12:01.875 --> 00:12:02.984
I always gave her comfort.

00:12:02.984 --> 00:12:04.484
I was always by her side.

00:12:04.755 --> 00:12:05.775
That's another way of saying it.

00:12:05.984 --> 00:12:06.974
I'm right by your side.

00:12:07.214 --> 00:12:07.935
I'm there for you.

00:12:08.295 --> 00:12:09.614
Or you can say I'm here for you.

00:12:09.824 --> 00:12:12.405
I don't want to confuse you because, you know...

00:12:13.285 --> 00:12:19.450
When we say, I'm here for you, most of the time, we're actually there with the person, present in the same place.

00:12:19.750 --> 00:12:21.910
Like, I'm right in front of you, and I can say, I'm here for you.

00:12:22.930 --> 00:12:28.930
Now, if you're talking about the future, I'll say I will be there for you because here is right now.

00:12:29.140 --> 00:12:33.610
There, since we're not there right now, it's most likely in the past or the future.

00:12:35.380 --> 00:12:36.400
I really hope that makes sense.

00:12:36.430 --> 00:12:38.080
It makes sense in my head when I explained it.

00:12:38.080 --> 00:12:38.950
So let, somebody, let me know.

00:12:39.010 --> 00:12:41.040
Send me a message or leave a comment.

00:12:41.069 --> 00:12:42.150
Let me know if that makes sense.

00:12:42.569 --> 00:12:46.470
All right, next on the list is to help someone out.

00:12:46.980 --> 00:12:48.900
Help you out, help me out, help them out.

00:12:49.080 --> 00:12:49.740
It's all the same.

00:12:49.920 --> 00:12:55.230
And it just means to give ones services or resources to make it easier for someone to do something.

00:12:55.380 --> 00:12:58.860
So you might be thinking, what's the difference between help and help out?

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:04.110
There's really no distinct difference in my mind.

00:13:04.140 --> 00:13:13.395
I would just say the only difference I can think of at the moment is maybe
help out is, like, when you're helping someone out of a difficult situation.

00:13:14.235 --> 00:13:16.305
That, I think, is a more common way to use, help out.

00:13:16.485 --> 00:13:22.485
If you're doing, if you're going through something difficult and you need help to get out of the situation, then I would help you out.

00:13:22.814 --> 00:13:29.295
Imagine if you're stuck in a hole and you can't get out of the hole by yourself, I help you out of the hole.

00:13:29.895 --> 00:13:33.495
And again, it's, help and help out are essentially the same thing.

00:13:33.525 --> 00:13:37.125
But that's the one small distinction that I can make between those two.

00:13:37.305 --> 00:13:37.545
All right?

00:13:38.819 --> 00:13:39.060
Cool.

00:13:39.089 --> 00:13:42.810
Now, next on the list is arrange, arrange someone's funeral.

00:13:42.959 --> 00:13:47.520
To arrange a funeral just means to organize or make plans for a future event.

00:13:47.520 --> 00:13:49.860
And the future event in this case is the funeral.

00:13:49.860 --> 00:13:51.120
So we can arrange a party.

00:13:51.360 --> 00:13:53.880
We can arrange a meeting, arrange a funeral.

00:13:54.150 --> 00:14:00.449
Now, this word arrange when we use it in this way is a more formal way of saying organize or plan.

00:14:00.689 --> 00:14:02.130
So we can organize a funeral.

00:14:02.730 --> 00:14:03.720
We can arrange a funeral.

00:14:03.750 --> 00:14:07.710
We can organize or plan a party, or we can arrange a party.

00:14:07.870 --> 00:14:09.210
Just a more formal way of saying it.

00:14:10.470 --> 00:14:14.250
So, the next word or next phrase on the list is call out.

00:14:14.880 --> 00:14:16.320
He said a voice called out.

00:14:16.650 --> 00:14:21.210
Now, there's more than one meaning for this word, so I'll explain the two most common.

00:14:21.780 --> 00:14:29.440
In this context, to call out, if a voice calls out, it just means to summon someone to deal with an emergency or provide a service.

00:14:30.540 --> 00:14:31.920
So maybe that doesn't make much sense.

00:14:31.920 --> 00:14:33.840
So let me try and explain it a different way.

00:14:34.590 --> 00:14:36.870
Call and call out are similar.

00:14:36.900 --> 00:14:41.850
But when we hear call out in this context, it's most likely because the voice came from within,

00:14:42.630 --> 00:14:46.200
came from inside us or some hidden place that we can't see,

00:14:46.440 --> 00:14:49.920
and the voice came out of that hidden place and we heard it.

00:14:50.730 --> 00:14:51.660
Hopefully, that makes sense.

00:14:51.950 --> 00:14:59.895
Now, the same phrasal verb call out in a different context means to draw critical attention to someone's unacceptable actions or behavior.

00:15:00.135 --> 00:15:05.354
For example, let's imagine we're walking down the street and we see some guy literally pissing in the street,

00:15:05.805 --> 00:15:08.415
urinating in the street in front of everybody.

00:15:08.745 --> 00:15:11.834
Most people will probably just walk by and say, man, that dude is crazy,

00:15:12.045 --> 00:15:13.814
but you're like, nah, fuck that.

00:15:13.814 --> 00:15:14.714
That's unacceptable.

00:15:14.714 --> 00:15:18.525
So you walk over and you call him out for what he's doing.

00:15:18.824 --> 00:15:21.885
You basically, in front of everybody, out loud to his face...

00:15:22.875 --> 00:15:26.715
you might yell at him or reprimand him or basically scold him or say,

00:15:26.715 --> 00:15:28.215
you're doing, what you're doing is wrong.

00:15:28.305 --> 00:15:29.145
That's unacceptable.

00:15:29.145 --> 00:15:33.045
You're calling him out on his unacceptable behavior.

00:15:33.285 --> 00:15:33.615
Okay.

00:15:34.845 --> 00:15:35.055
All right.

00:15:35.055 --> 00:15:41.985
Next on the list is embarrassed, embarrassed as means feeling self-conscious or ashamed or awkward.

00:15:42.255 --> 00:15:45.645
You probably know that, but just in case you don't, now you know what embarrassed means.

00:15:46.245 --> 00:15:48.075
And next is the moral of the story.

00:15:49.035 --> 00:15:50.775
And the word I want to explain here is moral.

00:15:50.775 --> 00:15:53.925
There's more than one meaning, but when we say the moral of the story,

00:15:54.255 --> 00:15:58.995
the moral of the story is basically the lesson that can be taken away from the story.

00:15:59.205 --> 00:16:03.345
A lot of times it's referring to what is right or wrong, but that's not always the case.

00:16:03.345 --> 00:16:11.145
You can just understand that the moral is the lesson or the idea that you should take away, that you should understand after hearing the story.

00:16:11.445 --> 00:16:12.645
That's the moral of the story.

00:16:13.365 --> 00:16:13.575
All right.

00:16:13.575 --> 00:16:14.785
The next word on the list is.

00:16:15.885 --> 00:16:18.675
N E G L E C T neglect.

00:16:18.975 --> 00:16:22.755
And to neglect something just means to fail, to care properly for something.

00:16:22.965 --> 00:16:26.564
So if you neglect your kids, you're not taking care of them like you should.

00:16:26.685 --> 00:16:31.064
You're not feeding them like you should or giving them the love and attention and time that they need.

00:16:31.425 --> 00:16:31.725
Right?

00:16:31.725 --> 00:16:32.625
So you're neglecting them.

00:16:32.805 --> 00:16:36.645
If you neglect your car, eventually it's going to break down.

00:16:36.645 --> 00:16:41.385
It's going to stop working because you have to change the oil, put air in the tires, you have to wash it and things like that.

00:16:41.595 --> 00:16:46.015
So it just means to avoid or to fail to take care of something properly.

00:16:47.484 --> 00:16:53.305
The next word on the list is to nourish N O U R I S H nourish.

00:16:53.545 --> 00:17:00.115
And that means to provide with the food or other substances necessary for growth, for your health, or for good condition.

00:17:00.705 --> 00:17:02.790
So again, we can use the example of your children.

00:17:03.030 --> 00:17:04.200
You need to nourish them.

00:17:04.319 --> 00:17:09.119
You need to give them the food that they need so that they can grow, the water that they need so they can survive.

00:17:09.450 --> 00:17:09.690
Right?

00:17:09.690 --> 00:17:12.720
You need to give them the love, and affection, and attention.

00:17:12.720 --> 00:17:15.210
That's also a form of nourishment, right?

00:17:15.210 --> 00:17:20.760
You're feeding them the things that they need to grow the same way that you would feed a plant or something like that.

00:17:21.060 --> 00:17:21.359
Right?

00:17:22.679 --> 00:17:22.980
All right.

00:17:23.010 --> 00:17:23.609
Two more words.

00:17:23.609 --> 00:17:24.179
We're almost done.

00:17:24.210 --> 00:17:25.859
Last one, it's not last one.

00:17:25.919 --> 00:17:32.985
The second to last one is pray P R A Y, which is different from P R E Y.

00:17:33.225 --> 00:17:34.065
So don't get confused.

00:17:34.065 --> 00:17:35.985
They sound exactly the same, they're homophones,

00:17:36.255 --> 00:17:46.005
but this word P R A Y means to address a solemn request or expression of thanks to a deity or a God or some other object of worship.

00:17:46.995 --> 00:17:50.125
So hearing myself read that definition it's...

00:17:51.105 --> 00:17:52.875
you know, maybe not the easiest thing to understand,

00:17:52.875 --> 00:17:55.335
and you probably know what pray means, you know,

00:17:55.335 --> 00:18:00.675
but just in case, pray, you can think of it as the moment where you sit down and you talk to..

00:18:01.305 --> 00:18:03.015
You can, some people call it different things.

00:18:03.015 --> 00:18:08.895
It could be God, it could be some other deity of worship, some object of worship, the universe, whatever it is,

00:18:09.705 --> 00:18:13.745
but you're having a conversation with a higher power.

00:18:14.395 --> 00:18:16.350
Whatever it is that you believe in, you're praying.

00:18:16.620 --> 00:18:16.950
Okay?

00:18:18.210 --> 00:18:21.780
Now, last word on the list, which you probably know is meditate.

00:18:21.899 --> 00:18:25.169
M E D I T A T E meditate.

00:18:25.710 --> 00:18:30.840
And it just means to think deeply or focus one's mind for a period of time in silence

00:18:31.200 --> 00:18:37.290
or with the aid of chanting for religious or spiritual purposes or as a method of relaxation.

00:18:37.500 --> 00:18:40.139
So that's that time when you just sit in a quiet room by yourself.

00:18:41.085 --> 00:18:43.335
And some people will choose to focus on their breathing.

00:18:43.575 --> 00:18:45.735
Some people choose to focus on certain thoughts.

00:18:46.095 --> 00:18:51.765
Everybody meditates in their own way, but it's just that moment when you sit down and you basically do nothing.

00:18:52.635 --> 00:18:53.775
There's many reasons for doing that.

00:18:53.775 --> 00:18:57.795
Everybody meditates in different ways for different reasons, but you get the point, right?

00:18:57.795 --> 00:19:06.075
When you sit down and you deeply focus on just one thing or nothing, you know, you get the point.

00:19:06.375 --> 00:19:06.615
Right?

00:19:07.315 --> 00:19:07.585
All right.

00:19:07.605 --> 00:19:09.315
So let's just summarize this episode.

00:19:10.350 --> 00:19:13.290
Four wives, number one or number four, excuse me.

00:19:13.320 --> 00:19:13.950
Number four.

00:19:14.190 --> 00:19:14.730
The body.

00:19:15.210 --> 00:19:17.850
Take care of your body because it's the only one that you have.

00:19:18.240 --> 00:19:23.730
You have to nourish it, take care of it, give it what it needs to maintain itself healthy.

00:19:24.540 --> 00:19:26.580
Number three, possessions.

00:19:27.390 --> 00:19:28.440
Enjoy your possessions.

00:19:28.470 --> 00:19:32.490
They can be great sources of joy during your time here on earth, right?

00:19:33.270 --> 00:19:35.910
Wife number two, your friends and your family.

00:19:36.490 --> 00:19:42.330
Appreciate your friends and family, because they are the only ones that you can trust and rely on when things get difficult.

00:19:42.870 --> 00:19:45.450
And wife number one, your soul.

00:19:46.379 --> 00:19:47.370
Nourish your soul.

00:19:48.060 --> 00:19:51.650
It's the only thing that you will take with you to the afterlife.

00:19:52.850 --> 00:19:56.730
All right, my friend, that is Coffee with Kaizen number 21 in the books.

00:19:57.090 --> 00:19:59.274
So I will talk to you later.

00:19:59.415 --> 00:20:00.225
Peace.

1
00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:01.120
What's up, everybody?

2
00:00:01.120 --> 00:00:03.610
You are listening to another episode of Life in English.

3
00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:06.440
I'm your host, Tony Kaizen.

4
00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:10.290
And today I want to talk to you about learning English by yourself.

5
00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:13.740
More and more people around the world are starting to ditch the language schools

6
00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:17.230
And simply learn foreign languages at home by themselves.

7
00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:22.410
But how can you learn to communicate in a foreign language without having anyone to communicate with?

8
00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:27.330
In this episode, I'm going to share a simple activity that will help you to increase your vocabulary

9
00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:31.920
And improve your speaking skills, even if you don't have anyone to talk to.

10
00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:37.420
All right? Let's do it.

11
00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:41.520
Now before I tell you about the activity,

12
00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:43.630
I want to tell you how I came up with this idea.

13
00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:48.330
One of my favorite rappers is known for taking three to five words that people suggest to him

14
00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:51.280
And doing a freestyle rap that incorporates the words.

15
00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:55.170
His name is Harry Mack coming out of scandalous Los Angeles, California.

16
00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:58.360
And I got to say, man, if you've got love for real hip hop,

17
00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:02.940
If you appreciate real talent, if you want to see greatness personified,

18
00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:06.340
Then please take some time to check out Harry Mack on YouTube,

19
00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:09.180
Particularly his Omegle Bars series.

20
00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:14.010
He gets on Omegle and asks people for three random words to inspire his freestyle.

21
00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:17.490
He turns on a beat and he just fucking murders it, man.

22
00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.640
Time and time again. It's insane.

23
00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:23.610
So I'm going to leave a link to his channel in the description for this episode.

24
00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:26.910
Or you can just search on YouTube for Harry Mack.

25
00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:34.050
That's H A R R Y, Harry. M A C K, Mack. Harry Mack on YouTube.

26
00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:38.650
But anyway, I was watching one of his videos the other day and I thought to myself,

27
00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:47.340
This guy's active vocabulary is so extensive that it almost seems inhuman or unhuman. It's one of those.

28
00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:53.090
I mean, the amount of different words that this guy has at his disposal is insane to me.

29
00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:55.990
Like, his ability to take three just random words

30
00:01:56.050 --> 00:02:00.700
And incorporate them into a three-minute improvised yet coherent

31
00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:04.100
song that rhymes is something that never ceases to amaze me.

32
00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:09.560
And thinking about his active vocabulary made me remember another one of his videos

33
00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:11.950
That showed him preparing for the tour he was about to go on.

34
00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:16.520
But since he's a freestyle rapper, he wasn't rehearsing the songs he would perform

35
00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:21.430
Because you can't improvise, or excuse me, you can't rehearse a freestyle. Right?

36
00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:23.680
So instead, to prepare for his shows,

37
00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.040
He simply opens a random word generator on the internet,

38
00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:30.610
Uses the words as inspiration, and starts improvising to a beat.

39
00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:35.660
Just to get the creative juices flowing before the show. You know what I'm saying?

40
00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:38.190
And that made me think about conversations with people.

41
00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:41.640
You're just improvising. Right?

42
00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:46.630
In a conversation, you almost never know what the other person or people are going to say.

43
00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:50.480
They say some random words and those words make you think.

44
00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:53.990
Then you respond with some improvised random words,

45
00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:55.770
And those words make them think.

46
00:02:56.520 --> 00:03:00.270
Then the cycle repeats itself and the whole time you're both improvising.

47
00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:03.520
It's not like you're reading from a script or something like that. Right?

48
00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:07.950
And that's why having conversations with real people is the most dynamic

49
00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:11.620
And effective way to learn how to communicate in any language.

50
00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:15.870
Now, improvising can be uncomfortable or awkward at first,

51
00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:19.380
But when you're doing it all the time, it just starts to come natural to you.

52
00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:24.780
In other words, you get good at improvising. You get good at having conversations with anyone.

53
00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:29.260
But what if you don't have anyone to talk to? What can you do?

54
00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:32.130
Well, you can do what Harry Mack does.

55
00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:37.500
Simply go online, open a random word generator, they're free by the way,

56
00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:40.500
And use those words to improvise your own freestyle.

57
00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:43.400
Now, of course, you don't have to make it rhyme.

58
00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:47.770
You just talk about each word and as much detail as you possibly can.

59
00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:54.020
And this is such a great way to learn new vocabulary and force yourself to think in English.

60
00:03:54.640 --> 00:04:00.690
But, not because, but this exercise will only work if you're willing to play

61
00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:04.760
And experiment and sound silly and just have some fun.

62
00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:08.140
You can't take it too seriously. You know?

63
00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:12.640
The point isn't to make the most coherent sentences or the most engaging story.

64
00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:15.810
Just talk and keep talking.

65
00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:20.170
Don't judge yourself and say more than you think you need to say.

66
00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:24.750
The whole point of the exercise is to talk as much as possible.

67
00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:28.580
And the random word generator forces you to think on your feet

68
00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:31.410
The same way you do in a conversation with a stranger.

69
00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:36.840
The difference is that with the word generator, you can take as much time as you need.

70
00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:39.950
No one's waiting for you or judging you.

71
00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:43.210
And you can do this exercise any time, anywhere.

72
00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:47.920
Now, something I recommend you do during the exercise is take notes,

73
00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:52.220
Because you're going to see very quickly that there are a bunch of things you don't know how to say.

74
00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:57.740
And when you get to a point where you don't know a particular word or phrase, you got two choices.

75
00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:02.350
The first one is to stop and search for the vocabulary on the internet

76
00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:06.360
Or send a message to your language exchange partner or your teacher or whoever.

77
00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:09.090
You find the answer and then you continue speaking.

78
00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:14.280
The second option is to simply write down all the things you couldn't say in a notebook somewhere,

79
00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:17.770
And at this point, you'd be writing in your native language and that's fine.

80
00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:22.310
But then search for the words and phrases after you finish the speaking exercise.

81
00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:26.490
So in summary, the main difference between your two choices is,

82
00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:29.790
You stop and search for something every time you hit a wall

83
00:05:30.420 --> 00:05:32.870
And you can't find a word or a phrase that you don't know how to say.

84
00:05:33.410 --> 00:05:35.960
Or you just write everything down during the exercise

85
00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:41.940
And later you go search one by one for these words and phrases and expressions and stuff like that.

86
00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:46.600
I just think this could be a much more intentional way of using your time

87
00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:50.660
When you're trying to improve your speaking skills and your vocabulary by yourself.

88
00:05:51.710 --> 00:05:55.650
So now I'm going to give you a quick demonstration so you can see exactly

89
00:05:55.650 --> 00:06:00.620
How I think the exercise should be done and then you can make your own adjustments to it if you want.

90
00:06:01.090 --> 00:06:03.090
You know, you do whatever works for you. All right?

91
00:06:03.470 --> 00:06:06.250
But if you're watching this on YouTube, I'm going to share my screen with you.

92
00:06:06.610 --> 00:06:10.450
If you're just listening, I'm going to do my best to give you the play-by-play,

93
00:06:10.980 --> 00:06:13.690
You know, the color commentary. You know?

94
00:06:13.690 --> 00:06:17.960
And use my vernacular to describe what's happening in the actualar.

95
00:06:19.810 --> 00:06:21.740
That didn't make sense. Actualar, I don't think is a word.

96
00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:24.530
I'm just playing around. So let me share my screen real quick.

97
00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:28.340
All right, cool.

98
00:06:28.340 --> 00:06:29.840
So for those of you watching on YouTube,

99
00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:34.420
You can see I've simply gone to the website randomwordgenerator.com.

100
00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:40.140
But if you search on Google or Bing or DuckDuckGo for "random word generator",

101
00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:42.200
I'm sure there are a bunch of different ones.

102
00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:44.290
But if you want to use the same one as me,

103
00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:47.060
Then go to randomwordgenerator.com.

104
00:06:48.430 --> 00:06:50.650
So really quick before I actually do the exercise,

105
00:06:50.700 --> 00:06:54.460
I just want to talk about everything you see on the screen because this website is pretty cool.

106
00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:56.430
So if we look here in the left corner...

107
00:06:57.050 --> 00:06:59.710
Actually first, let's look at the header, the menu bar,

108
00:06:59.710 --> 00:07:01.560
The navigation bar, whatever you want to call it.

109
00:07:02.040 --> 00:07:06.670
You can generate random words or specifically random nouns,

110
00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:12.090
Or specifically random verbs or names, or even complete sentences,

111
00:07:12.340 --> 00:07:16.400
Phrases, numbers, letters. You can generate all these things randomly.

112
00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:18.170
So it doesn't have to be just one word.

113
00:07:18.570 --> 00:07:22.700
And now if we look in the left corner here, you can actually change the number of words.

114
00:07:23.180 --> 00:07:26.150
So I want three random words like Harry Mack.

115
00:07:26.150 --> 00:07:28.470
Or five random words or 10 random words.

116
00:07:28.720 --> 00:07:34.190
And I'll show you the benefit of using more than one word after I show you the basic exercise. All right?

117
00:07:34.250 --> 00:07:35.840
I don't want to lose you or confuse you.

118
00:07:36.200 --> 00:07:40.460
So to keep it simple, we're just going to generate one random word.

119
00:07:40.460 --> 00:07:43.900
It doesn't matter what kind of words. So I'm going to check all words

120
00:07:44.680 --> 00:07:45.950
And then I just click Generate.

121
00:07:46.430 --> 00:07:48.750
And once I click Generate, it gives me a random word

122
00:07:48.750 --> 00:07:53.700
And we just or I just talk about that word in as much detail as I possibly can.

123
00:07:54.310 --> 00:07:59.050
There are no other rules or guidelines. There's no wrong way to do this.

124
00:07:59.050 --> 00:08:00.700
You just talk. All right?

125
00:08:01.110 --> 00:08:03.240
So let's get started, man.

126
00:08:03.240 --> 00:08:05.130
Let's do a couple of words and see how this goes.

127
00:08:05.440 --> 00:08:07.410
So I'm going to click Generate a random word.

128
00:08:08.330 --> 00:08:13.820
Thoughtful. T H O U G H T F U L.

129
00:08:14.540 --> 00:08:18.900
Another thing that might be helpful is to spell the words out loud because all of it is just practice.

130
00:08:19.420 --> 00:08:22.250
There are times when you need to spell words, especially in English,

131
00:08:22.280 --> 00:08:25.960
Because not all words are written how they sound.

132
00:08:25.960 --> 00:08:30.300
So you can be a thoughtful person and spell the word for somebody on the phone. Right?

133
00:08:30.890 --> 00:08:34.040
Like, if you call customer service and they ask you what your name is

134
00:08:34.990 --> 00:08:39.850
And you know you have a challenging name or a name that doesn't exist in their native language

135
00:08:39.850 --> 00:08:42.490
That you know people have trouble spelling, you can be thoughtful

136
00:08:42.900 --> 00:08:45.360
And immediately after saying your name, you can spell it.

137
00:08:46.880 --> 00:08:51.240
That helps the customer service representative a lot when getting information from you,

138
00:08:51.240 --> 00:08:52.730
That's a very thoughtful thing you can do.

139
00:08:53.610 --> 00:08:57.660
Speaking of being thoughtful, when I think of thoughtful,

140
00:08:57.660 --> 00:09:00.320
I think of flowers for some reason. You know?

141
00:09:00.600 --> 00:09:04.880
Because traditionally, in the context of a romantic relationship,

142
00:09:04.880 --> 00:09:10.010
A thoughtful gift to give your partner is flowers, and I never understood why.

143
00:09:10.010 --> 00:09:14.090
Like, why flowers specifically or chocolate specifically?

144
00:09:14.150 --> 00:09:15.940
There are so many things you could give to your partner.

145
00:09:16.220 --> 00:09:20.160
What if your partner doesn't like flowers or chocolate? You know?

146
00:09:21.250 --> 00:09:24.730
Being thoughtful is nice, but I think you got to know what they like

147
00:09:24.730 --> 00:09:28.520
Instead of just getting them the generic flowers and chocolates.

148
00:09:28.520 --> 00:09:29.460
That's not very thoughtful.

149
00:09:29.970 --> 00:09:34.600
Like, you thought of me and you bought the gift, but I don't even fucking like chocolate.

150
00:09:34.600 --> 00:09:37.880
So were you thinking about me? Were you? You know?

151
00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:41.670
Anyway, it's good to be thoughtful, man.

152
00:09:42.010 --> 00:09:47.170
It's good to be full of thoughts. It's good to be full of thoughts.

153
00:09:48.190 --> 00:09:49.720
From time to time, not all the time.

154
00:09:50.220 --> 00:09:55.540
Because sometimes it's good to be void of thoughts, to think nothing. You know?

155
00:09:56.480 --> 00:09:58.630
And just witness, just observe, don't think anything.

156
00:09:59.720 --> 00:10:03.550
That's easier said than done or easy to say than it is to do.

157
00:10:04.620 --> 00:10:09.430
But, yeah. Anyway, sometimes it's good to be full of thoughts.

158
00:10:09.430 --> 00:10:13.840
Sometimes it's good to be void of thoughts. But being a thoughtful person is always good.

159
00:10:14.190 --> 00:10:17.010
Taking consideration of those around you and you know,

160
00:10:17.590 --> 00:10:21.240
The context of a situation and things like that. That's a good thing.

161
00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:24.590
Because I'm sure you've met people who are not thoughtful.

162
00:10:25.120 --> 00:10:29.290
If you drive a car on the freeway in the United States you come into

163
00:10:29.290 --> 00:10:31.730
Contact with people who are not thoughtful all the time.

164
00:10:31.730 --> 00:10:35.460
Because people here, man, maybe it's just in the big cities. I don't know.

165
00:10:36.250 --> 00:10:40.190
But they drive like they're the only person on the road and nobody else exists.

166
00:10:40.190 --> 00:10:47.140
Like, What the fuck, bro? You know? No thought or consideration for any of the other,

167
00:10:47.810 --> 00:10:52.060
You know, thousand-pound death machines traveling at 90 miles an hour.

168
00:10:52.060 --> 00:10:54.020
No thought or consideration for any of that.

169
00:10:54.860 --> 00:10:57.490
It's just them on a three-lane freeway by themself.

170
00:10:59.270 --> 00:11:02.670
They don't give a fuck about anyone or anything else. No blinkers.

171
00:11:03.480 --> 00:11:06.780
You know, people that... Bro, you want to talk about inconsiderate people?!

172
00:11:06.780 --> 00:11:07.940
Because when you think about it,

173
00:11:08.310 --> 00:11:11.250
A thoughtful person is similar to a considerate person. Right?

174
00:11:11.250 --> 00:11:15.140
You think about other people, you take other people into consideration.

175
00:11:15.140 --> 00:11:17.700
So the opposite would be inconsiderate.

176
00:11:18.140 --> 00:11:23.860
So people who are not thoughtful, people who are inconsiderate, on the freeway,

177
00:11:23.960 --> 00:11:28.270
Like the worst kind are the ones that drive slow in the fast lane, bro.

178
00:11:28.810 --> 00:11:31.880
I don't know how this works in your country, but here in the U.S.

179
00:11:31.920 --> 00:11:37.240
It's just like an unwritten rule, if there's a three-lane freeway or highway,

180
00:11:39.140 --> 00:11:41.520
The lane furthest to the right is the slow lane.

181
00:11:42.200 --> 00:11:45.450
You can drive slow on the freeway, but just do it in this lane right here. You know?

182
00:11:45.860 --> 00:11:49.690
Then the lane in the middle is moderate speed. Not too fast. Not too slow.

183
00:11:49.900 --> 00:11:51.550
The left lane is the fast lane, bro.

184
00:11:52.310 --> 00:11:54.340
Why the fuck are you driving slow in the fast lane?

185
00:11:54.630 --> 00:12:01.230
With 15 cars behind you. Just move over. Just move over, bro.

186
00:12:01.230 --> 00:12:03.970
I don't understand. Like, I don't understand.

187
00:12:03.970 --> 00:12:05.700
That's just like the way things work.

188
00:12:07.130 --> 00:12:09.980
If you're in a fast lane and the people behind you are going faster than you

189
00:12:09.980 --> 00:12:13.680
Just move over one so that they can get to where they need to go.

190
00:12:13.680 --> 00:12:14.710
Why are you holding them up?

191
00:12:16.410 --> 00:12:22.030
You could easily move your hand like 15 degrees to the right and be in a different lane.

192
00:12:22.030 --> 00:12:24.290
Get the fuck out of everybody's way. That's thoughtful.

193
00:12:25.850 --> 00:12:27.070
That would be the thoughtful thing to do.

194
00:12:27.930 --> 00:12:30.400
But so many people, they're just like, "No, this is my freeway".

195
00:12:31.290 --> 00:12:34.240
I'm going to go as fast as I want in the fast lane,

196
00:12:34.240 --> 00:12:37.020
Even if it's slower than everyone else on the freeway. Because fuck it.

197
00:12:37.560 --> 00:12:39.880
Land of the free. I do what I want. Right?

198
00:12:41.700 --> 00:12:44.850
Don't be that guy. Do not drive slow in the fast lane.

199
00:12:44.850 --> 00:12:47.440
Get the fuck out of people's way, man. Be thoughtful. Be considerate.

200
00:12:50.240 --> 00:12:52.170
You can tell I drive on the freeway every day.

201
00:12:52.300 --> 00:12:56.380
This is just, that shit... It used to drive me like batshit crazy.

202
00:12:56.760 --> 00:12:58.330
Now it's just like, it is what it is.

203
00:12:58.330 --> 00:13:02.260
There's nothing you can do about it. Right? There's nothing you can do.

204
00:13:02.400 --> 00:13:03.900
Such shitty drivers everywhere.

205
00:13:05.780 --> 00:13:07.590
Anyway, that's thoughtful.

206
00:13:07.610 --> 00:13:09.080
Now, I just did that whole tangent.

207
00:13:09.110 --> 00:13:11.890
I went off on that entire tangent based on the word thoughtful.

208
00:13:12.560 --> 00:13:14.280
So if you're still with me at this point, hopefully,

209
00:13:14.280 --> 00:13:19.050
You can get the idea is I just take that word, I spell the word, which is helpful for many reasons.

210
00:13:19.430 --> 00:13:21.590
And then I just think, what does it mean to be thoughtful?

211
00:13:22.140 --> 00:13:24.520
It's thoughtful a noun, a verb, or an adjective?

212
00:13:25.190 --> 00:13:27.270
Can I use it with prepositions in the phrase?

213
00:13:27.530 --> 00:13:29.940
What are the most common prepositions to use with this word?

214
00:13:30.360 --> 00:13:32.200
You know, am I pronouncing this word correctly?

215
00:13:32.930 --> 00:13:36.200
And what context can I use this word? Are there any synonyms for this word?

216
00:13:36.620 --> 00:13:40.690
Now, as a language teacher and somebody who's fascinated by language in general,

217
00:13:40.780 --> 00:13:44.580
I think much more deeply about language than I think the average person.

218
00:13:45.160 --> 00:13:49.020
I don't know if that's true. It's just in my experience. That's the impression I get.

219
00:13:49.260 --> 00:13:54.120
So I'm not saying you have to think, is this noun, verb, adjective? Which prepositions? My pronunciation...

220
00:13:54.120 --> 00:13:59.020
You don't have to like, be overwhelmed by all those questions, or even consider those things.

221
00:13:59.020 --> 00:14:02.480
The point is just to talk, but I'm saying when I'm talking about this word,

222
00:14:02.480 --> 00:14:06.520
When I'm thinking about what can I say about this word, I'm considering things like that.

223
00:14:07.410 --> 00:14:09.080
Hopefully, you get the idea. All right?

224
00:14:09.360 --> 00:14:13.810
So let's do one more word. Maybe two more. You know? Just for more examples.

225
00:14:13.900 --> 00:14:16.510
Give you something to listen to, and you can see how I do this.

226
00:14:16.510 --> 00:14:19.630
Because I understand that my first language is English

227
00:14:20.050 --> 00:14:23.900
So it's much easier for me to just improvise a random story

228
00:14:23.900 --> 00:14:26.270
Or just start talking about any given word.

229
00:14:26.610 --> 00:14:28.320
You are trying to increase your vocabulary.

230
00:14:28.670 --> 00:14:32.890
But like I said before, if you're taking notes, you'll see you're trying to speak,

231
00:14:32.890 --> 00:14:34.650
You have things to say, but you don't know how.

232
00:14:34.650 --> 00:14:39.060
So now you go and study those things specifically. You go back and you do it again.

233
00:14:39.650 --> 00:14:40.940
That's how you practice and improve.

234
00:14:40.940 --> 00:14:45.030
That's how you fill the holes in your vocabulary so that you become solid,

235
00:14:45.030 --> 00:14:49.010
You have a nice, strong foundation upon which you can build.

236
00:14:49.850 --> 00:14:54.920
Hopefully, I'm not losing you. I'm sure you get the point. I hope you get the point.

237
00:14:55.190 --> 00:14:56.610
Let's do one more word, let's keep it moving.

238
00:14:59.130 --> 00:15:10.630
Difficulty. D I F F I C U L T Y, difficulty. Difficulty.

239
00:15:11.280 --> 00:15:16.040
A lot of people have difficulties, man. Everyone has difficulties.

240
00:15:16.320 --> 00:15:21.480
That's what's interesting, man, is when you talk to enough people from all different social classes,

241
00:15:21.480 --> 00:15:25.920
Economic classes, races, different gender, different age,

242
00:15:25.920 --> 00:15:28.870
Like all these different categories that we find ourselves in,

243
00:15:28.870 --> 00:15:30.240
When you talk to people from all of them,

244
00:15:30.930 --> 00:15:33.190
You realize that everybody's got difficulties in life, man.

245
00:15:34.280 --> 00:15:37.760
Everyone, even the person you look up to and you think their life is just perfect,

246
00:15:37.760 --> 00:15:41.210
They're living their dream. Even they have difficulties.

247
00:15:41.800 --> 00:15:47.260
Men, women, rich, poor, black, white, young, old, smart, stupid, funny, boring.

248
00:15:47.260 --> 00:15:48.580
Like, everyone has difficulties.

249
00:15:50.070 --> 00:15:53.190
Which is all the more reason to treat people with kindness and respect, man.

250
00:15:53.190 --> 00:15:56.870
You know what I'm saying? Because life can be really hard.

251
00:15:57.580 --> 00:16:01.560
So why are you, you know, why make it harder by being a dick or being an asshole?

252
00:16:02.140 --> 00:16:04.990
Why would you do that? It's good for no one, right?

253
00:16:04.990 --> 00:16:07.650
You put out that negativity, that disrespect,

254
00:16:07.650 --> 00:16:14.410
And that hatred, that black, nasty shit. You know?

255
00:16:14.410 --> 00:16:18.310
Just all that... Not black, nasty shit. What's the word I'm looking for?

256
00:16:18.520 --> 00:16:21.540
You spew that hatred. It's just... it's disgusting. It's nasty.

257
00:16:21.980 --> 00:16:25.030
You put that out into the fucking universe. You put that on other people.

258
00:16:25.380 --> 00:16:27.900
Karma is real. So it's just going to come right back to you.

259
00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:31.290
Which is going to make you feel bad, so you want to make somebody else,

260
00:16:31.290 --> 00:16:32.950
Why would you do that? Why would you do that?

261
00:16:32.950 --> 00:16:34.850
Why make life more difficult than it needs to be?

262
00:16:36.260 --> 00:16:41.390
I've been realizing that a lot lately, like, just personally over the past like 10 years,

263
00:16:41.390 --> 00:16:45.150
Just making life so much harder, so much more difficult than it needs to be.

264
00:16:47.540 --> 00:16:49.190
I heard a couple of weeks ago that apparently,

265
00:16:49.190 --> 00:16:54.780
The age the ages 18 to about 28 are what they call "the dumb decade"

266
00:16:55.200 --> 00:16:58.960
Because as a young person from that age, you know,

267
00:16:58.960 --> 00:17:03.200
From the beginning of what we know of as adulthood to about 28,

268
00:17:03.630 --> 00:17:07.790
You just make so many dumb decisions, do so much stupid shit.

269
00:17:07.790 --> 00:17:11.630
You make life so much more difficult than it really needs to be. You know?

270
00:17:12.120 --> 00:17:16.650
And thus you make everyone else's lives so much more difficult than they need to be, man.

271
00:17:16.750 --> 00:17:17.990
That fucking dumb decade.

272
00:17:17.990 --> 00:17:24.390
And I feel so glad that I'm slowly inching my way out of the fucking dumb decade. You feel me?

273
00:17:25.960 --> 00:17:29.660
Difficulties, man. A lot of people have difficulties with English.

274
00:17:29.680 --> 00:17:32.590
And what's the main difficulty? Speaking. You know?

275
00:17:32.640 --> 00:17:37.870
I think listening is challenging at first, but when you do it enough, you get used to it.

276
00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:41.370
You listen to enough podcasts, you listen to enough interviews,

277
00:17:41.370 --> 00:17:45.240
You watch enough movies and TV series, you get used to it, eventually.

278
00:17:45.280 --> 00:17:49.030
Even if you still need the captions at the bottom of the screen, it's normal.

279
00:17:50.290 --> 00:17:53.430
But slowly but surely, you can improve that, and then once you get to a certain level,

280
00:17:53.430 --> 00:17:56.500
It just improves extremely fast. That's just the way the learning curve works.

281
00:17:57.400 --> 00:18:01.020
But when it comes to speaking, even the most advanced listeners,

282
00:18:01.450 --> 00:18:07.020
Writers and readers have difficulty with speaking. Because no one speaks.

283
00:18:08.100 --> 00:18:10.080
I think that's in general, not just language learners.

284
00:18:10.350 --> 00:18:13.290
I think one difficulty that we're going to face in the future,

285
00:18:13.330 --> 00:18:15.910
Especially with the next generation, it's just communication.

286
00:18:16.890 --> 00:18:21.530
What we know of as communication. Us old folks here, you know, 27 and up and shit.

287
00:18:21.860 --> 00:18:24.730
But we know of, what we know of as communication,

288
00:18:25.080 --> 00:18:27.210
Which is like talking to a real person face to face,

289
00:18:29.160 --> 00:18:31.130
It just feels like it's becoming less common.

290
00:18:31.130 --> 00:18:32.640
I don't know if it is, it just feels that way.

291
00:18:32.640 --> 00:18:38.100
Like, more and more people are just used to... My phone is too far, I can't grab it.

292
00:18:38.520 --> 00:18:42.120
But people are used to grabbing their phone and just looking at the phone

293
00:18:42.120 --> 00:18:48.400
And watching something or listening to something and not being required to talk. You know what I mean?

294
00:18:48.400 --> 00:18:56.340
Like, most people, especially the younger people spend most of their day looking at a phone. Right?

295
00:18:56.340 --> 00:18:59.790
But they're not talking to the phone, they're just watching video after video, after video.

296
00:19:00.110 --> 00:19:02.660
Or looking at picture after picture or reading, tweet after tweet.

297
00:19:02.900 --> 00:19:05.800
But they're never talking. So a lot of people, I think,

298
00:19:05.800 --> 00:19:11.020
Are just getting used to that being talked to, but not talking to people.

299
00:19:13.140 --> 00:19:14.340
I don't know if that makes sense to you.

300
00:19:14.700 --> 00:19:18.840
But that's what I think, man, I think that's a difficulty we're going to have to deal with.

301
00:19:19.930 --> 00:19:22.350
Now and in the future even more, unfortunately.

302
00:19:24.080 --> 00:19:28.570
So my recommendation is don't be one of those people, man. Get to talking.

303
00:19:28.570 --> 00:19:32.150
Because getting back to my point, the reason a lot of people have difficulty speaking.

304
00:19:32.150 --> 00:19:35.440
Is because they never speak. They never speak.

305
00:19:36.350 --> 00:19:37.820
They just listen, listen, listen, listen.

306
00:19:38.490 --> 00:19:42.910
And you can understand the difficulty when it comes to not being able to say what you want to say.

307
00:19:43.500 --> 00:19:44.880
But that just comes with time and practice.

308
00:19:45.070 --> 00:19:46.770
But there are a lot of people who can speak,

309
00:19:47.330 --> 00:19:50.400
But especially when it comes to a stranger or someone they don't know very well

310
00:19:50.550 --> 00:19:53.280
Or starting a conversation and keeping it going,

311
00:19:53.350 --> 00:19:57.540
A lot of people have difficulty with that. Myself included, you know?

312
00:19:58.120 --> 00:20:00.780
I've gotten better over the years through practice and effort.

313
00:20:00.810 --> 00:20:04.640
But still, it can be a challenge. You know,?

314
00:20:05.640 --> 00:20:07.650
So I think that's the main difficulty.

315
00:20:07.700 --> 00:20:13.410
And this whole exercise is trying to act as a solution

316
00:20:14.040 --> 00:20:18.300
Or an alleviation to that difficulty, let's say, trying to make it easier.

317
00:20:18.710 --> 00:20:21.440
Because again, maybe you don't have someone to talk to.

318
00:20:22.370 --> 00:20:24.120
But by doing something like this,

319
00:20:24.510 --> 00:20:27.030
Things get less difficult because at least you're trying to speak,

320
00:20:27.320 --> 00:20:30.600
You're trying to think in this language and you're realizing what you need to know.

321
00:20:31.040 --> 00:20:35.420
So there's never going to be a situation in which you don't learn something new,

322
00:20:35.660 --> 00:20:38.520
A new word, expression, or phrase when you do this exercise.

323
00:20:38.520 --> 00:20:41.410
Unless your English, like, you know every word in the language

324
00:20:41.740 --> 00:20:44.670
And you've had every thought you could possibly have in the language,

325
00:20:44.670 --> 00:20:47.020
It's always something new. You know?

326
00:20:47.350 --> 00:20:52.040
So anyway, I'll stop the demonstration there, because I'm sure you get the point.

327
00:20:52.560 --> 00:20:54.880
All off the word difficulty, I just said all that stuff.

328
00:20:55.250 --> 00:20:58.280
I just let my mind wander. I'm not judging myself

329
00:20:58.280 --> 00:21:00.410
Or really thinking too deeply about what I'm saying.

330
00:21:00.410 --> 00:21:05.060
I'm just talking and talking and talking. And I could talk for another hour if I really wanted to

331
00:21:05.400 --> 00:21:08.720
Because I got 27 years of practice of just talking.

332
00:21:09.970 --> 00:21:12.950
Just like every other skill you have, it's just years and years of practice.

333
00:21:13.260 --> 00:21:16.080
So by sitting down, opening a random word generator,

334
00:21:16.130 --> 00:21:20.650
And just getting the juices flowing, you're practicing, man. You're practicing.

335
00:21:21.380 --> 00:21:24.380
So I don't know exactly what would happen if you did this exercise three

336
00:21:24.380 --> 00:21:27.260
Or four times a day for the next month. I have no idea,

337
00:21:27.570 --> 00:21:32.710
But I imagine that your ability to think in English is going to improve like you never imagined possible.

338
00:21:33.500 --> 00:21:36.100
And this is something you can do if you don't have anyone to talk to.

339
00:21:36.100 --> 00:21:39.130
But even if you do have someone, it's a simple game.

340
00:21:39.130 --> 00:21:44.160
You can play anytime, anywhere. You can play it with another person. You know?

341
00:21:44.160 --> 00:21:47.680
Like, I give you a random word and you start talking and I critique your speech.

342
00:21:47.940 --> 00:21:50.040
You give me a random word and I do the same thing.

343
00:21:50.420 --> 00:21:52.100
Now, one other thing I wanted to show you,

344
00:21:52.220 --> 00:21:56.620
I almost forgot is using more than one word to increase the difficulty

345
00:21:56.620 --> 00:22:01.260
Because maybe one word is boring to you And the word difficulty doesn't inspire you in any way.

346
00:22:01.810 --> 00:22:05.350
Another thing that I was thinking about making a separate episode about,

347
00:22:05.350 --> 00:22:09.650
But it's really the same exercise with just more difficulty. So I'll explain it now.

348
00:22:10.360 --> 00:22:14.830
You can take three words just like Harry Mack, generate those random three words.

349
00:22:14.830 --> 00:22:17.610
Like, here we have pitch, long and cold.

350
00:22:18.040 --> 00:22:22.620
And what you can do is try to create an actual story with these three words.

351
00:22:23.210 --> 00:22:27.160
Now again, you don't have to be like Harry Mack and make the story rhyme with every line,

352
00:22:27.160 --> 00:22:30.730
But you can take the words "pitch" "long" and "cold" and make an actual story.

353
00:22:31.270 --> 00:22:34.900
It could be a story with just five sentences, 50 sentences.

354
00:22:34.900 --> 00:22:38.480
It could be as long as you want. There are no rules, you know?

355
00:22:39.370 --> 00:22:43.570
Like, I love watching a good game of football on a nice, clean pitch, you know,

356
00:22:43.800 --> 00:22:46.930
After a long day of work on a cold winter evening.

357
00:22:47.890 --> 00:22:49.610
Just take those three words and of course,

358
00:22:49.660 --> 00:22:52.250
I have more practice with English that might not be so easy to you,

359
00:22:52.870 --> 00:22:56.530
But it's just an example. I just took those three words and just start talking.

360
00:22:57.250 --> 00:23:01.470
Just weave them into the speech because you're forcing your brain to be creative,

361
00:23:01.470 --> 00:23:03.900
To produce these thoughts and it's all in English.

362
00:23:04.660 --> 00:23:05.910
And there's no wrong way to do it.

363
00:23:06.480 --> 00:23:10.110
You can't fail at this exercise and the whole time you're just talking

364
00:23:10.110 --> 00:23:13.490
And you're not even thinking about that. You're just focusing on trying to have fun

365
00:23:13.490 --> 00:23:16.840
And be creative and let your mind wander. You know?

366
00:23:17.340 --> 00:23:21.180
So if you want to increase the difficulty, increase the number of words that you use,

367
00:23:21.490 --> 00:23:26.560
And maybe instead of talking just randomly about a specific word or phrase or expression,

368
00:23:26.830 --> 00:23:30.270
Try to create a story. You know? Take three words, five words,

369
00:23:30.270 --> 00:23:33.650
Seven words, and you can write this down if you need to first,

370
00:23:33.650 --> 00:23:38.220
Or you can just speak without thinking and just create a random story. You know?

371
00:23:38.220 --> 00:23:42.750
I'm going to start doing this myself. So I highly recommend you do it, man.

372
00:23:42.750 --> 00:23:47.220
Because the benefits don't have to do just with thinking and speaking in English,

373
00:23:47.520 --> 00:23:51.160
But also just being creative, just improvising in general. You know?

374
00:23:51.480 --> 00:23:53.660
Getting better at storytelling and things like that.

375
00:23:54.790 --> 00:23:58.120
These are like, really good skills to have, they can help you in more than one way,

376
00:23:58.590 --> 00:24:03.680
But especially in the context of language, especially in the context of making conversation,

377
00:24:04.300 --> 00:24:06.180
Especially with people you don't know very well,

378
00:24:06.180 --> 00:24:08.100
But you want to have some kind of connection with.

379
00:24:08.470 --> 00:24:12.180
It's all based on communication, bro. It's all based on that.

380
00:24:12.180 --> 00:24:18.020
So improving your communication skills will guarantee that everything else gets better along with it.

381
00:24:18.330 --> 00:24:20.090
Just trust me on that. Okay?

382
00:24:20.550 --> 00:24:24.570
But like I said, you can do this alone. You can do this with somebody else.

383
00:24:25.100 --> 00:24:28.870
You can do it as many times a day as you want, anywhere, anytime.

384
00:24:29.220 --> 00:24:32.450
On the bus, at the doctor's office, in your kitchen. It doesn't matter.

385
00:24:32.980 --> 00:24:35.460
Just find an object or a word and start talking about it.

386
00:24:36.290 --> 00:24:40.690
You can even experiment with the difference between thinking in your head and thinking out loud.

387
00:24:41.900 --> 00:24:43.560
Now, I don't know why, but it's much easier for me

388
00:24:43.560 --> 00:24:46.670
To think out loud in a foreign language than it is to think in my head.

389
00:24:46.670 --> 00:24:50.410
But anyway, if you end up giving this exercise a try,

390
00:24:50.410 --> 00:24:53.140
Then I recommend documenting your progress.

391
00:24:53.390 --> 00:24:56.880
So record short videos of yourself every time you do the exercise

392
00:24:57.130 --> 00:25:00.350
So you can track your progress and share it with the community and me.

393
00:25:01.140 --> 00:25:04.770
Also, take note of all the nouns, verbs, adjectives, prepositions,

394
00:25:04.770 --> 00:25:08.800
Phrases, expressions, and slang that you learn, you know,

395
00:25:09.010 --> 00:25:12.980
Or that you need to learn during the exercise and review them from time to time.

396
00:25:13.560 --> 00:25:15.840
Talk to real people about the things you learned to make sure

397
00:25:15.840 --> 00:25:18.800
You truly understand what you're learning. You know?

398
00:25:19.560 --> 00:25:23.520
So I know that this activity might sound a little simple and silly,

399
00:25:23.720 --> 00:25:25.590
But I've come to realize that the best methods for

400
00:25:25.590 --> 00:25:31.260
Achieving great success at anything are usually very simple methods.

401
00:25:31.260 --> 00:25:35.750
And this exercise is kind of like the "Wax on, wax off" type of activity.

402
00:25:36.140 --> 00:25:39.340
That will help you to start speaking in more detail about anything you want.

403
00:25:40.430 --> 00:25:42.580
And the fact that you can do it alone means that

404
00:25:42.580 --> 00:25:46.090
It can help alleviate the problem for millions of people around the world

405
00:25:46.390 --> 00:25:49.860
Who constantly complain about having no one to speak with, in English.

406
00:25:51.650 --> 00:25:55.990
Now, if you'd like some feedback on your English, if you'd like to have your mistakes corrected,

407
00:25:56.250 --> 00:26:01.210

00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:04.630
All right y'all. Most of us know about the Oscars and the significance of this event.

2
00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:08.280
It's when a bunch of rich and famous people and all their publicists get all dressed up

3
00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:10.260
To go suck each other's dicks for a couple of hours,

4
00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:13.330
Narcissistically, telling themselves how wonderful they are.

5
00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:18.630
So I'm not going to waste any time talking about the Oscars or the so-called prestige of this event.

6
00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:20.730
Let's get right into the real reason we're here,

7
00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:25.290
And that's to talk about what happened between Chris Rock and Will Smith at the Oscars.

8
00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:30.960
Now, Will Smith slapped the absolute shit out of Chris Rock after he made a joke about Jada Pinkett Smith.

9
00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:35.140
This moment, for better or for worse, is the topic of everyone's discussions right now,

10
00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:38.420
And it's ironically the topic of this podcast episode.

11
00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:43.310
Now, I highly recommend you watch this episode on YouTube to get the complete experience,

12
00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:45.530
Because I'm going to be showing pictures and videos,

13
00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:49.910
And I think it might be a little confusing at times if you can't see what I'm talking about.

14
00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:56.320
So if you can go to YouTube.com/lifeinenglish to watch the full episode.

15
00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:01.280
But now let's take a look at what actually happened, or at least what we saw on TV.

16
00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:07.390
Chris Rock was making jokes about some of the actors in the crowd, like Javier Bardem and Penelope Cruz.

17
00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:11.290
And then he made a joke about Jada Pinkett Smith and the fact that she's now bald

18
00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:15.530
Because of a disease called alopecia. So let's take a look at that clip real quick.

19
00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:22.490
You know who's got the hardest job tonight? Javier Bardem and his wife are both nominated.

20
00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:34.700
Now, if she loses, he can't win. He is praying that Will Smith wins. Like, please, Lord!

21
00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:40.060
Jada, I love you. G.I. Jane 2, can't wait to see it. All right.

22
00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:51.460
It's just.. That was a nice one! Ok. I'm out here.. Uh oh, Richard.

23
00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:58.400
[Will Smith slaps Chris Rock] Oh, wow. Wow.

24
00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:02.370
Will Smith just smacked the shit out of me.

25
00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:09.190
Keep my wife's name out your fucking mouth.

26
00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:10.270
Wow, dude.

27
00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:10.400
Yes.

28
00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:13.290
It was a G.I. Jane joke.

29
00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:18.530
Keep my wife's name out your fucking mouth.

30
00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:30.430
I'm going to, ok? Ok, woah, ok. That was uh.. Greatest night in the history of television. Ok. Ok.

31
00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:36.380
All right. So before we go any further, let me explain what alopecia is,

32
00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:42.580
Just in case you're not familiar with this disease. Alopecia areata, also known as spot baldness,

33
00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:46.610
Is a condition in which hair is lost from some or all areas of the body.

34
00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:51.920
Often it results in a few bald spots on the scalp, each about the size of a coin.

35
00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:58.310
Psychological stress and illness are possible factors in bringing on alopecia in individuals at risk,

36
00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:02.960
But in most cases, there's no obvious trigger. People are generally otherwise healthy.

37
00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:09.220
In a few cases, all the hair on the scalp is lost or all body hair is lost and can be permanent.

38
00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:14.210
So as you can see, the only real symptom of this disease is partial or in some cases,

39
00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:17.320
Complete loss of hair, typically on the head and face.

40
00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:20.970
Now, what does that have to do with the joke that Chris Rock told?

41
00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:23.190
Well, let's hear that joke one more time.

42
00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:28.500
Jada, I love you. G.I. Jane 2, can't wait to see it. All right.

43
00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:33.930
So you might be asking yourself who or what is G.I. Jane?

44
00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:40.870
Well, G.I. Joe is a fictional character that was created to represent members of the U.S. armed forces.

45
00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:46.880
It started out as an action figure and turned into various movies and this entire media franchise.

46
00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:53.720
Now, G.I. Jane is a movie that came out back in 1997 about a woman who joins the U.S. Navy

47
00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:57.190
During a time when most people believe that women shouldn't join the military

48
00:03:57.190 --> 00:04:00.770
Because they're too weak and passive and feminine and all that stuff.

49
00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:04.590
So if you're watching this on YouTube, you can see that the woman in the movie

50
00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:09.350
G.I. Jane ended up shaving her head to look like the rest of the men in the military.

51
00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:14.020
And that's why Chris jokingly said he couldn't wait to see Jada in G.I. Jane 2.

52
00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:17.180
And of course, we know what happened after he made the joke.

53
00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:20.390
So now I'd really just like to share my opinion with you.

54
00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:24.890
But before I do that, let's summarize the main talking points that we've surely heard by now.

55
00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:30.620
Here are some main arguments against Chris Rock, people that think that Chris Rock was wrong, right?

56
00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:35.450
People say that Chris Rock was out of line because you can't joke about people's illnesses.

57
00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:39.320
They say that it was the wrong place and time for the joke. Right?

58
00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:44.340
They say that or I can't say 'they'. But we were talking about this in the community the other day,

59
00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:52.580
And one of our members said that what Chris Rock said was a form of violence... A form of violence.

60
00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:57.570
And some people also say that, you know, he had.. How can I say that?

61
00:04:57.570 --> 00:05:03.350
Some people say that they believe in free speech, but only if it's not mean or hurtful speech.

62
00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:06.030
Like, hate speech is not included in free speech.

63
00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:09.740
Mean or disrespectful words are not included in free speech.

64
00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:14.090
And therefore what he said was not okay. He did not have the right to say that. Right?

65
00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:18.730
Now, people who support Will Smith or think that he was in the right say things

66
00:05:18.730 --> 00:05:22.020
Like Will Smith was defending his wife's honor. Right?

67
00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:26.770
Because Chris Rock attacked his wife. So he was defending his wife in some way.

68
00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:30.610
Other people say that sometimes it's hard to think twice before you act.

69
00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:35.150
So even if what Will Smith did was wrong, you can excuse him for it.

70
00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:40.640
Because in the heat of the moment, you know, he didn't think twice about his actions and he just reacted, right?

71
00:05:41.140 --> 00:05:46.720
Other people say, "If it were me or if I were Will Smith, I would have done the same thing!" You know?

72
00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:50.670
Or, "If I had to choose a side between Will Smith and Chris Rock,

73
00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:55.670
I choose Will Smith because Chris Rock was out of line. He disrespected Will Smith's wife.

74
00:05:56.010 --> 00:05:59.920
And therefore, if I had to choose, I would side with Will Smith."

75
00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:04.660
Now I want to make a disclaimer. I want to make it clear that I have no intention

76
00:06:04.660 --> 00:06:09.620
Of judging anyone involved in this situation nor anyone who has an opinion that opposes mine.

77
00:06:10.010 --> 00:06:13.460
I simply like to talk about the actions that were taken and not the people themselves,

78
00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:17.900
Because although I don't know these people, it's an opportunity for us to have a conversation

79
00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:24.510
About important topics like what's right and what's wrong, responsibility, free speech, respect?

80
00:06:24.930 --> 00:06:29.470
And manhood. Right. So without further adieu, let me tell you what I think.

81
00:06:30.900 --> 00:06:33.100
So let's take it all the way back to the beginning, right?

82
00:06:33.100 --> 00:06:37.090
Chris Rock told this joke about Jada Pinkett Smith's appearance,

83
00:06:37.170 --> 00:06:41.530
And a lot of people would say it was completely uncalled for. It was disrespectful.

84
00:06:41.530 --> 00:06:46.240
It was the wrong place in time. And on some level, I could agree with that.

85
00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:50.600
Like, me personally, I have a very, very, very dark sense of humor.

86
00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:53.610
Like, in my opinion, there's absolutely nothing that cannot be joked about.

87
00:06:53.970 --> 00:06:59.410
Because at the end of the day, a joke is meant to make light of a situation. You see what I'm saying?

88
00:06:59.580 --> 00:07:04.440
So when you joke about something, you're basically saying, like, "This is reality,

89
00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:07.940
And here's the bright side of it." That's really the idea of a joke,

90
00:07:07.940 --> 00:07:16.190
Especially when you're joking about something dark or negative or sensitive or something like that.

91
00:07:16.190 --> 00:07:17.570
You're making light of the situation.

92
00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:21.910
Now, people will say that this is the Oscars. This is not a comedy show, right?

93
00:07:21.910 --> 00:07:24.280
We understand that comedians make light of situations

94
00:07:24.280 --> 00:07:28.800
And we understand that if a comedian is in the room, nobody is safe, right?

95
00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:31.690
If you look funny, you're going to get made fun of if you say something stupid,

96
00:07:31.690 --> 00:07:34.180
You're going to get made fun of. It could be anybody in the room.

97
00:07:34.490 --> 00:07:37.030
But this is the Oscars. This is not a comedy show.

98
00:07:37.430 --> 00:07:43.960
And for him to single out Jada Pinkett Smith specifically was uncalled for. It was unnecessary.

99
00:07:43.960 --> 00:07:49.400
And I can agree with that. But at the same time, it was a joke, bro. It was a joke.

100
00:07:49.400 --> 00:07:52.350
He didn't say, "Hey, bitch, you look ugly. Look at your bald head. HA HA!"

101
00:07:52.350 --> 00:07:54.540
He said, "G.I. Jane 2, can't wait to see it."

102
00:07:54.540 --> 00:07:57.610
Because you look like the lady from fucking G.I. Jane, bro.

103
00:07:58.170 --> 00:08:03.000
So some people say it was the wrong place, wrong time. He was out of line.

104
00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:06.590
He got what he deserved. You know, he should have been slapped in the face, you know?

105
00:08:07.670 --> 00:08:11.390
And it's fine if you have that opinion. I just think that, you know,

106
00:08:13.050 --> 00:08:15.610
There was nothing wrong with the joke. But that's a question of opinion, right?

107
00:08:15.610 --> 00:08:20.520
I just.. He could have said something much, much, much worse about her appearance.

108
00:08:20.520 --> 00:08:24.710
But I think it was a light-hearted joke. But it's just a question of opinion, you know what I'm saying?

109
00:08:24.710 --> 00:08:27.620
But when you think about the reaction, what happened next..

110
00:08:28.520 --> 00:08:32.540
If we watch the video again, you saw that most people in the room laughed.

111
00:08:32.540 --> 00:08:34.450
Some people were like, "Well, that's kind of fucked up."

112
00:08:34.710 --> 00:08:37.230
But Will Smith himself, his first reaction was to laugh.

113
00:08:37.230 --> 00:08:39.730
It was like, ha ha, like a light-hearted joke. We get it.

114
00:08:40.230 --> 00:08:46.200
Then he looks at his wife, she's not feeling it, and then he changes his reaction.

115
00:08:46.200 --> 00:08:49.920
He said, "No, now it's time to be big and tough and I got to defend my wife. I'm going to do something."

116
00:08:49.920 --> 00:08:53.900
And he walks up on stage on live TV and slaps the shit out of this man.

117
00:08:53.900 --> 00:08:56.800
And the justification is you disrespected my wife.

118
00:08:58.360 --> 00:09:04.470
Now, you know, I guess depending on how you look at it, you could say he was protecting his wife.

119
00:09:04.510 --> 00:09:10.300
But the question is protecting from what? A joke? Another man's words?

120
00:09:11.280 --> 00:09:14.920
You know what I'm saying? Like, what exactly was he protecting her from?

121
00:09:14.920 --> 00:09:19.310
Where was the actual danger in the situation? You see what I'm saying?

122
00:09:19.310 --> 00:09:22.930
Like, some people will say, "Oh, well, in the heat of the moment, you know, he got triggered.

123
00:09:22.930 --> 00:09:25.680
It's hard to think twice. And he just.. He just acted.

124
00:09:25.680 --> 00:09:28.920
So we can't really judge him or hold him accountable for that.

125
00:09:28.920 --> 00:09:31.670
And if it were me, I would have done the same thing.

126
00:09:31.670 --> 00:09:34.690
If somebody makes a joke about my wife's appearance or somebody's talking shit,

127
00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:41.380
I slap the shit out of them too." But would you really? Would you really?

128
00:09:41.380 --> 00:09:46.060
Like, let's be honest, if Dwayne Johnson, The Rock, or Brock Lesnar

129
00:09:46.280 --> 00:09:51.060
Or Francis Ngannou was up on stage and your wife has alopecia and she's sitting next to you,

130
00:09:51.350 --> 00:09:54.010
And he says, "G.I. Jane 2, can't wait to see it. Ha, ha."

131
00:09:54.400 --> 00:09:59.100
Are you really going to get up on stage and slap the taste out of one of these men's mouths?

132
00:10:01.450 --> 00:10:04.270
Come on, bro. Like, let's be serious. You would not do the same thing.

133
00:10:04.550 --> 00:10:07.810
Maybe if it was a person that was smaller than you that you weren't afraid of,

134
00:10:07.810 --> 00:10:10.990
That you felt that you could take in a fight. You might do something like that.

135
00:10:11.150 --> 00:10:14.000
But let's be honest, bro. If it was somebody that could beat the shit out of you,

136
00:10:15.260 --> 00:10:16.800
And he made a joke about your wife's appearance.

137
00:10:16.800 --> 00:10:19.010
Would you get up on stage and slap the shit out of his face?

138
00:10:20.730 --> 00:10:23.540
I doubt it. I don't know, but I doubt it.

139
00:10:24.250 --> 00:10:27.830
But let's get to the real root of the situation here because you're saying..

140
00:10:27.830 --> 00:10:33.240
What you're telling me.. For people that.. We can already agree that what Chris Rock said was unnecessary.

141
00:10:33.240 --> 00:10:36.770
Now, whether you think the joke was inappropriate or disrespectful or whatever,

142
00:10:36.770 --> 00:10:39.970
That's a question of opinion. I don't think it was. It was just a fucking joke.

143
00:10:40.280 --> 00:10:42.810
But I remember that my sense of humor is extremely dark

144
00:10:43.150 --> 00:10:46.160
And I am nowhere near as sensitive as most people these days.

145
00:10:46.180 --> 00:10:48.800
So I'm taking that into consideration. I get it.

146
00:10:49.410 --> 00:10:53.290
But if we talk about what actually happened, this man made a joke. He said something.

147
00:10:53.940 --> 00:10:59.040
And Will Smith's reaction was to get physically violent, to slap him in the face.

148
00:11:00.120 --> 00:11:02.970
If you're saying that was justifiable and he was protecting his wife,

149
00:11:03.690 --> 00:11:07.090
What I hear you saying is anytime somebody says something that you don't like

150
00:11:07.600 --> 00:11:10.050
Or any time you feel disrespected by somebody's words,

151
00:11:10.090 --> 00:11:15.730
It is completely fine to slap the shit out of them. Or to beat they ass.

152
00:11:15.730 --> 00:11:18.860
That's really what you're saying here, that it's totally justifiable.

153
00:11:18.860 --> 00:11:21.600
Any time somebody says something that you don't like,

154
00:11:22.240 --> 00:11:26.770
Beat the shit out of them or cancel them or whatever it is. You know,

155
00:11:26.770 --> 00:11:29.880
"If I had to choose sides, I would choose Will's side." But, like, bruh...

156
00:11:32.610 --> 00:11:35.760
There's so many things here. Like, first of all, he laughs first,

157
00:11:36.870 --> 00:11:39.030
And then changed his reaction and got up there and slapped him.

158
00:11:39.030 --> 00:11:42.300
And he didn't even, like.. The way he went about it..And this is just my opinion,

159
00:11:42.300 --> 00:11:46.820
Again, but it was just such a bitch move to me, bruh, to get up on stage and slap that man.

160
00:11:46.820 --> 00:11:51.260
And first of all, he sucker slapped him, you know, because.. That's really not even a term.

161
00:11:51.260 --> 00:11:56.760
But the term sucker punch.. To sucker punch someone means to punch somebody when they're not expecting it.

162
00:11:57.080 --> 00:12:02.540
So if you watch the clip again, you'll see where Smith walked up, and looked down for a second,

163
00:12:03.850 --> 00:12:06.500
And then he slapped them out of nowhere. It was a surprise.

164
00:12:06.690 --> 00:12:08.450
Nobody knew that the slap was actually coming.

165
00:12:08.450 --> 00:12:11.610
And that's what it means to sucker somebody, to sucker punch somebody..

166
00:12:11.610 --> 00:12:15.920
Is they're not expecting it, everything is cool, and all of a sudden, bam, you punch them.

167
00:12:17.060 --> 00:12:21.380
And you might have your own opinion about that, but that's just a bitch move. That's a coward's move.

168
00:12:21.380 --> 00:12:23.870
If we're going to fight, if there's going to be a confrontation,

169
00:12:24.510 --> 00:12:27.090
You're walking up to this person, there's no hesitation, there's no talking.

170
00:12:27.090 --> 00:12:31.300
You punch them, and then you stand there, and we're going to fight now.

171
00:12:32.180 --> 00:12:35.980
You don't slap a man like a woman, like a little bitch, and then turn around and walk away.

172
00:12:36.950 --> 00:12:39.860
Run away. He walked, but turn around and run away. You know what I'm saying?

173
00:12:39.860 --> 00:12:42.760
That's just a bitch move, bro. That's a bitch move. If you..

174
00:12:42.760 --> 00:12:46.300
If it's really a problem and you're going to slap a man in his mouth,

175
00:12:47.680 --> 00:12:49.680
Then you stand there and wait for his retaliation.

176
00:12:49.680 --> 00:12:51.920
We're going to fight now. That's just my opinion.

177
00:12:52.230 --> 00:12:55.890
And ladies, I don't expect you guys to understand this one.

178
00:12:56.590 --> 00:13:00.570
But as a man, one of the things that's most important to us is respect.

179
00:13:01.170 --> 00:13:07.730
And to slap a man with an open hand... It's just one of the highest forms of disrespect

180
00:13:08.210 --> 00:13:14.040
That you can demonstrate towards another man. You just.. You just don't do that. You see what I'm saying?

181
00:13:14.040 --> 00:13:18.130
Like, to slap a man with an open hand is basically communicating you think he's a bitch.

182
00:13:18.450 --> 00:13:20.650
He's less than a man. That's what you do with a woman.

183
00:13:20.860 --> 00:13:23.060
Now, ladies, no disrespect. I'm not saying that you should hit women.

184
00:13:23.060 --> 00:13:25.780
I'm not saying that you slap women. I don't condone that behavior.

185
00:13:25.780 --> 00:13:30.020
So, like, please don't come at me with that bullshit. Just follow me and try to understand my point.

186
00:13:30.570 --> 00:13:35.660
You slap a man with an open hand. That's what you do to a bitch. You're saying he's a bitch? Right?

187
00:13:36.510 --> 00:13:41.240
You just don't do that. You don't do it, especially in the context of that situation, bruh.

188
00:13:42.940 --> 00:13:47.810
Like, I mean, let's put it this way. You're saying Chris Rock disrespected..

189
00:13:48.800 --> 00:13:56.760
Excuse me, one second. You're saying Chris Rock disrespected Will Smith's wife with this joke,

190
00:13:56.880 --> 00:14:00.320
And therefore it's justifiable for him to defend his wife's honor and get up there

191
00:14:01.230 --> 00:14:05.350
And punch him in the mouth. Right? Both were kind of wrong in the situation.

192
00:14:05.350 --> 00:14:08.410
But we can understand Will Smith's side because he was protecting his wife.

193
00:14:08.790 --> 00:14:09.960
But let me ask you this question.

194
00:14:10.280 --> 00:14:13.200
For those of you that are of the opinion that Will Smith was justified.

195
00:14:14.120 --> 00:14:19.350
Let's switch it for just a second. Imagine we're at a presidential inauguration

196
00:14:19.350 --> 00:14:26.160
Or some formal event and Barack Obama is up on stage and Donald Trump's wife has alopecia.

197
00:14:26.160 --> 00:14:29.430
She's bald and he says "G.I. Jane 2, can't wait to see it."

198
00:14:31.010 --> 00:14:35.670
Or even more accurate, he makes a joke about his wife's citizenship

199
00:14:35.940 --> 00:14:38.470
Or her accent when she's speaking English or something like that.

200
00:14:39.470 --> 00:14:44.660
Would it be justifiable if Donald Trump got up on stage and slapped the shit out of Barack Obama?

201
00:14:46.850 --> 00:14:51.430
Would that be okay? Would that be justifiable? Of course not. You'd be ready to castrate that man.

202
00:14:51.680 --> 00:14:55.980
Bury him under the fucking jail. This racist.. And he did it because he was black.

203
00:14:56.030 --> 00:14:59.530
Donald Trump slapped him because he was black. And he's a racist piece of shit.

204
00:14:59.790 --> 00:15:02.100
And, oh, it was just a joke, bro. You can't take a joke?

205
00:15:02.470 --> 00:15:07.450
What, your fucking ego is too weak, Donald Trump? You're a bitch. It was just a joke. Relax, man.

206
00:15:08.040 --> 00:15:12.070
Tell me I'm wrong. Tell me that wouldn't be the majority of people's reaction.

207
00:15:12.070 --> 00:15:14.810
Like, come on, bro, let's be real for a second.

208
00:15:14.810 --> 00:15:20.750
Like, just because you're a fan of this person doesn't mean that they can do no wrong. You know what I'm saying?

209
00:15:20.750 --> 00:15:24.930
Like, and again, I don't know or give a fuck about Will Smith, Chris Rock, Jada Pinkett.

210
00:15:24.930 --> 00:15:28.540
We're talking about the actions that were taken. Right? So if we switch it..

211
00:15:28.540 --> 00:15:35.680
Those same actions with different people, would it be the same? I just don't think so. I don't think so.

212
00:15:35.680 --> 00:15:40.230
Because going back to the joke that was made, you're saying it's not okay to joke about people's illnesses,

213
00:15:40.490 --> 00:15:44.110
Which it certainly is, in my opinion. There's nothing that cannot be joked about.

214
00:15:44.730 --> 00:15:48.750
Now, if she was lying on her deathbed and he was making jokes like, "Ha, ha, you're about to die."

215
00:15:48.750 --> 00:15:51.740
Like that's.. That's a little too much. I can agree with that, you know?

216
00:15:51.740 --> 00:15:58.060
But I just don't think. The joke was inappropriate or too much or disrespectful in any way.

217
00:15:58.060 --> 00:15:59.770
It was a good joke, but that's just my opinion.

218
00:16:00.220 --> 00:16:02.900
But if it's not okay for us to joke about people's appearance,

219
00:16:02.940 --> 00:16:06.020
If it's not okay for us to joke about people's illness or what they look like,

220
00:16:06.340 --> 00:16:10.230
How they sound, whatever, it's not okay to make jokes at other people's expense.

221
00:16:10.690 --> 00:16:17.270
Why is it then okay, nobody says shit, nobody's upset or angry in any way when we joke about somebody like Donald Trump?

222
00:16:18.060 --> 00:16:22.880
"Hey, orange man. Hey, orange face. Hey, yellow hair, toupee man,

223
00:16:22.880 --> 00:16:25.680
You ugly motherfucker, you piece of shit." That's totally fine".

224
00:16:25.910 --> 00:16:29.040
It's totally fine to joke about his wife's citizenship or her accent

225
00:16:29.040 --> 00:16:31.650
Or the fact that she worked here as a model with no visa or whatever.

226
00:16:31.950 --> 00:16:37.190
That's totally fine. Why? Because you don't like him. Because you don't respect him.

227
00:16:38.260 --> 00:16:43.030
That's the only reason that it's okay. But if it's somebody you like, if it's somebody you support,

228
00:16:43.180 --> 00:16:47.540
If it's a woman, if it's a black man, if it's a gay man, if it's a transsexual, then it's not okay.

229
00:16:50.840 --> 00:16:56.180
I call bullshit, bro. That's very.. It's extremely hypocritical. Right or wrong..

230
00:16:57.520 --> 00:17:01.880
Whatever happened, whether you think it's right or wrong, that's hypocritical, I think. You know?

231
00:17:01.880 --> 00:17:05.450
And it's like we just have to understand, like, this is..

232
00:17:05.850 --> 00:17:09.170
If we're talking we're taking the context of the situation into consideration,

233
00:17:09.170 --> 00:17:13.620
This is the Oscars, this prestigious event. Most of us know Will Smith is going to win the award.

234
00:17:14.610 --> 00:17:19.510
And the moment, I mean, like, this is his first Oscar, if I'm not mistaken.

235
00:17:19.510 --> 00:17:23.120
And, like, a 20-year career in acting. He should have been won an Oscar a long time ago,

236
00:17:23.120 --> 00:17:27.850
But he finally wins. And that moment is overshadowed by the fact that he couldn't control himself

237
00:17:27.850 --> 00:17:34.020
In the moment because somebody made a joke about his wife. I don't know.

238
00:17:34.110 --> 00:17:36.290
You might say, like, "If I was him, I'd do the same thing.

239
00:17:36.320 --> 00:17:38.870
Somebody disrespects me and makes a joke about me or my wife.

240
00:17:39.660 --> 00:17:42.550
We're going to fight or I'm going to slap the shit out of you or whatever."

241
00:17:43.960 --> 00:17:49.600
It's a question of opinion, man. But I just think. As a man or a woman, as an adult,

242
00:17:49.650 --> 00:17:55.500
As an evolved, educated human being, You understand that words are just words.

243
00:17:57.550 --> 00:18:01.730
They're just words. Like, who gives a fuck what people got to say, bro, who gives a fuck?

244
00:18:01.730 --> 00:18:07.760
If somebody makes a joke about your appearance or your job or your weight or your height or your whatever.

245
00:18:09.140 --> 00:18:15.470
Who gives a shit? If you can't take a joke all that means is you cannot accept reality.

246
00:18:17.410 --> 00:18:20.840
In my opinion, that's all that means, because the joke is just making light of reality.

247
00:18:20.840 --> 00:18:23.920
We're.. Maybe it's a terrible reality, maybe it's a dark reality,

248
00:18:24.180 --> 00:18:26.250
But we're making light of that situation. We're laughing at it.

249
00:18:26.290 --> 00:18:30.090
We're saying this is the case, but let's try to make light of it.

250
00:18:30.090 --> 00:18:32.640
Let's laugh about it because at the end of the day, this is reality.

251
00:18:32.670 --> 00:18:36.570
We cannot change or bend or alter reality just because we don't like it.

252
00:18:37.410 --> 00:18:40.560
So let's laugh about it. If we can't laugh about it, what else do we have?

253
00:18:40.560 --> 00:18:45.580
If we can't say what we're really thinking, what else do we have? Right?

254
00:18:45.610 --> 00:18:51.490
Because that's all you're saying. In that moment. it was just words. It was just a joke.

255
00:18:52.710 --> 00:18:59.070
I made a joke about your wife's appearance. So when you can't take that and you decide, like,

256
00:18:59.690 --> 00:19:02.960
I'm feeling triggered. I'm feeling angry. After you laughed about it..

257
00:19:02.960 --> 00:19:05.950
Immediately after you laughed about the joke, you then change your mind,

258
00:19:05.950 --> 00:19:08.930
And then you want to play the tough guy and go physically assault this man.

259
00:19:09.510 --> 00:19:14.060
All you've shown the entire world is that all I have to do to get you out of your element,

260
00:19:14.470 --> 00:19:19.160
All I have to do to get you acting like a little bitch, like a coward, is just, pow, just flick you.

261
00:19:20.230 --> 00:19:23.340
Just say a couple of words and I can get you to throw your career away.

262
00:19:23.630 --> 00:19:26.140
I can get you to physically assault me and possibly go to jail.

263
00:19:27.340 --> 00:19:31.100
And spend who knows how much money on some type of lawsuit if I press charges and all this shit.

264
00:19:31.370 --> 00:19:33.510
That's all you've shown me, is how fucking small you are.

265
00:19:33.920 --> 00:19:37.190
Because all I had to do was say, "Ha, your wife's bald." and you're ready to fight.

266
00:19:38.880 --> 00:19:45.660
You's a bitch. You are a bitch, bro. You're weak. I'm not saying that in a judgmental way.

267
00:19:46.270 --> 00:19:50.370
I'm not saying that I'm better or worse than anybody else. It's just my opinion. That's weak as fuck.

268
00:19:52.120 --> 00:19:56.410
Like, if you're offended by somebody else's words to the point where you want to physically hurt them

269
00:19:56.840 --> 00:20:00.810
Or cancel them or get them fired or whatever it is, it's most likely

270
00:20:00.810 --> 00:20:02.970
Because your parents did a poor job of raising you.

271
00:20:03.260 --> 00:20:05.610
Your parents didn't teach you how the world actually works.

272
00:20:05.880 --> 00:20:09.660
Your parents didn't teach you how life actually works. Because a lot of people would say,

273
00:20:10.340 --> 00:20:15.190
Like, we were talking about this in the community on Discord the other day, and one of our members said,

274
00:20:15.760 --> 00:20:19.410
Or I asked everyone in the group, "Do you guys believe in freedom of speech?

275
00:20:19.410 --> 00:20:22.060
Do you think that Chris had the right to say what he said?

276
00:20:22.900 --> 00:20:26.200
Do you believe that anybody has the right to say anything negative or positive,

277
00:20:26.200 --> 00:20:28.310
Hurtful or helpful? Do you believe in that?"

278
00:20:29.040 --> 00:20:35.910
And one of our members said, "Yeah, but only if what the person is saying is not mean or hurtful or disrespectful.

279
00:20:35.910 --> 00:20:41.000
I don't think that they should have the ability or the platform or the stage to say those things."

280
00:20:42.720 --> 00:20:46.830
And if that's what you believe, that's totally fine. I mean, it's just a question of opinion, I guess.

281
00:20:46.860 --> 00:20:52.370
But what you're saying, what you're communicating is, "I believe in free speech, but only if.

282
00:20:53.630 --> 00:20:56.700
What the person is saying is something I like or want to hear."

283
00:20:57.910 --> 00:21:01.310
And that's not free speech. You cannot say, "I believe in free speech, but".

284
00:21:03.210 --> 00:21:06.240
There is no 'but'.. There's. That's the end of the sentence. I believe in free speech.

285
00:21:06.870 --> 00:21:11.810
Because free, freedom, the idea is no restrictions, no limits, no barriers.

286
00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:17.110
Do whatever you want, say whatever you want. So as soon as you say 'but', the speech is no longer free.

287
00:21:17.550 --> 00:21:23.850
And the problem here is you are arbitrarily putting limits on someone else's ability to express themselves freely.

288
00:21:24.790 --> 00:21:29.540
And the problem with that is life just doesn't work like that.

289
00:21:29.560 --> 00:21:34.400
The world is not going to stop and consider your thoughts or feelings

290
00:21:34.400 --> 00:21:39.230
Or experiences every time they have something to say. That's just not the way the world works.

291
00:21:39.460 --> 00:21:43.130
Because you, expressing your opinion, saying that he's wrong, saying that he deserved it,

292
00:21:43.130 --> 00:21:46.670
Saying he's a piece of shit or talking shit about somebody like Donald Trump.

293
00:21:46.880 --> 00:21:49.970
And I've said his name a few times. I keep using that example. I'm not like,

294
00:21:49.970 --> 00:21:52.990
"Yeah, go for Donald Trump, support him." I don't give a fuck about none of that.

295
00:21:53.130 --> 00:21:57.700
I'm not a Trump supporter or Obama supporter. I don't.. I have no political affiliation.

296
00:21:57.740 --> 00:22:01.790
I don't give a fuck about any of that. It's just.. That is a public figure that is..

297
00:22:02.650 --> 00:22:07.710
And it's totally fine to disrespect and degrade him, but not people that we like and respect.

298
00:22:08.580 --> 00:22:12.600
And I just think that's hypocritical. So I just wanted to make that clear, but it's like...

299
00:22:16.400 --> 00:22:22.090
I lost my train of thought. What was I saying? Ah, yeah. Free speech.

300
00:22:22.850 --> 00:22:27.320
Free speech, you can't say, "I believe that everyone has the right to express themselves,

301
00:22:27.370 --> 00:22:31.330
But only if they're saying something I like or appreciate or agree with."

302
00:22:31.670 --> 00:22:35.170
That's not how free speech works. And people died.

303
00:22:35.850 --> 00:22:39.780
People gave their lives so that you could sit up here and express your thoughts or opinions.

304
00:22:40.020 --> 00:22:42.730
So for you to turn around and say that somebody else can't just

305
00:22:42.730 --> 00:22:46.800
Because you don't like what they have to say is childish and hypocritical, I think.

306
00:22:47.980 --> 00:22:50.270
Because if you don't like what somebody has to say, you don't have to listen.

307
00:22:51.500 --> 00:22:54.550
You can always get up and fucking leave. Right?

308
00:22:55.100 --> 00:22:57.520
And how is it that you feel justified to say that you disagree?

309
00:22:58.550 --> 00:23:01.550
But he doesn't have the right or she doesn't have the right to say what they want to say?

310
00:23:01.590 --> 00:23:06.850
It doesn't make sense to me. Hate speech is free speech.

311
00:23:07.980 --> 00:23:12.110
Disrespectful speech is free speech. Hurtful speech is free speech.

312
00:23:12.410 --> 00:23:15.560
You don't have to like it or accept it, but that's what it is.

313
00:23:16.840 --> 00:23:21.200
Because think about it, if you're saying that we can only say things that are not hurtful, disrespectful,

314
00:23:21.200 --> 00:23:24.710
Controversial, we can only say things that won't hurt other people's feelings,

315
00:23:24.920 --> 00:23:28.780
We need to consider everyone's thoughts, feelings and experiences before we open our mouths,

316
00:23:29.070 --> 00:23:37.680
How the fuck are we going to speak about anything? We can't. Jordan Peterson said it best.

317
00:23:37.790 --> 00:23:42.960
In order to be able to think, you have to be able to risk being offensive to somebody.

318
00:23:44.380 --> 00:23:47.920
It's impossible to take.. Imagine we have a black person, a white person, a woman,

319
00:23:48.010 --> 00:23:52.840
A man, a gay person, a transsexual, a Latino, an Asian an African,

320
00:23:53.290 --> 00:23:56.680
All in the same room and I have something to say. You're telling me I need to stop,

321
00:23:57.470 --> 00:24:00.670
Think and consider all of these people from all of these different walks of life

322
00:24:00.670 --> 00:24:03.570
And make sure I'm not going to say anything that will hurt any of their feelings?

323
00:24:06.580 --> 00:24:09.110
That's childish, bro. It's ridiculous. It's like you're really..

324
00:24:09.340 --> 00:24:12.780
You just don't understand how life works. And you're totally fine..

325
00:24:12.780 --> 00:24:15.870
It's just hypocritical because you're totally fine saying what you have to say

326
00:24:15.870 --> 00:24:20.680
Or making jokes about things that you think are funny or expressing your opinion about certain things.

327
00:24:20.940 --> 00:24:25.180
And I highly doubt that you're taking the world into consideration every time you express yourself,

328
00:24:26.170 --> 00:24:30.510
And that's the way it should be. You shouldn't take the entire world into consideration. Right?

329
00:24:31.730 --> 00:24:34.420
It's ridiculous, bro. It's ridiculous.

330
00:24:35.020 --> 00:24:41.390
I am not responsible for your feelings about what I said. I'm responsible for what I say. That's it.

331
00:24:41.430 --> 00:24:44.580
Now, if there's a reaction to what I say, then I just have to deal with that.

332
00:24:44.620 --> 00:24:48.830
But to say that I'm responsible for how you feel about what I say is fucking childish.

333
00:24:50.320 --> 00:24:56.100
It's childish. I don't know what else to say about that.

334
00:24:56.140 --> 00:24:59.690
Like, if you can't understand that concept, I don't really know what else to say.

335
00:25:02.320 --> 00:25:04.820
You can't say "I believe in freedom of speech, but.

336
00:25:06.060 --> 00:25:10.030
And it's impossible to take everyone into consideration before you speak because then nobody would speak.

337
00:25:10.330 --> 00:25:12.990
And even if you do try to put those limits on someone else's speech,

338
00:25:13.900 --> 00:25:18.060
You think they're going to stop thinking what they think? Of course not.

339
00:25:18.160 --> 00:25:20.320
They're just not going to say it, but they keep thinking it.

340
00:25:21.790 --> 00:25:25.530
They're going to talk about it behind closed doors, which just makes it harder for us to communicate

341
00:25:25.920 --> 00:25:27.850
And for us to understand each other and to work together.

342
00:25:27.850 --> 00:25:32.400
Because now I smile and I say these nice things, but as soon as I shut the door

343
00:25:32.400 --> 00:25:34.770
And I'm with my friends, I'm saying something completely different.

344
00:25:35.430 --> 00:25:41.210
That's called 'politics'. That's politics. And we hate fucking politicians. Why?

345
00:25:41.410 --> 00:25:45.340
Because they say one thing and they do another. They say one thing and they believe another.

346
00:25:45.800 --> 00:25:50.770
We hate that shit. And you're asking everyone to be a fucking politician when you say

347
00:25:51.070 --> 00:25:56.230
"Only say things that are acceptable by everyone, only say things that will hurt no one's feelings."

348
00:25:56.230 --> 00:25:57.380
That's fucking crazy, bro.

349
00:25:59.390 --> 00:26:05.640
That is fucking ridiculous to say that if somebody says something that you don't like physically assault them,

350
00:26:05.750 --> 00:26:09.230
Beat the shit out of them, slap them if you feel disrespected, get physical.

351
00:26:09.730 --> 00:26:11.640
If you feel disrespected, try to get them fired.

352
00:26:11.640 --> 00:26:14.940
Try to ruin their lives because they hurt your feelings. It's childish.

353
00:26:16.860 --> 00:26:20.510
That's childish because if we go back to the moment at the Oscars, I mean,

354
00:26:20.540 --> 00:26:25.510
This great legendary American actor, Will Smith, his crowning achievement,

355
00:26:25.510 --> 00:26:30.900
He finally wins the Oscar. This is his moment. This is his night. Finally, he gets the award.

356
00:26:31.980 --> 00:26:34.300
And somebody makes a joke about his wife's appearance.

357
00:26:35.970 --> 00:26:43.120
In that moment, again, you know, it's hard to say what should have been done because it's a question of opinion.

358
00:26:43.720 --> 00:26:48.630
But in that moment you're saying, ok, you got disrespected. Somebody says something he didn't like.

359
00:26:49.010 --> 00:26:54.200
Why not sit there, grab your wife's hand, look at her and understand, we know who we are.

360
00:26:56.100 --> 00:26:59.430
So who gives a fuck with somebody else has to say about us or the way we look or what we do?

361
00:26:59.530 --> 00:27:03.690
I know who I am. She knows who she is. We know who we are.

362
00:27:04.280 --> 00:27:08.640
So there's nothing that you can tell me that's going to make me feel or think differently about myself.

363
00:27:08.640 --> 00:27:14.030
I know who I am. Because guess what? She is bald. Guess what?

364
00:27:14.030 --> 00:27:17.810
She does look like fucking G.I. Jane. She does, that's just the truth.

365
00:27:18.180 --> 00:27:22.060
Now, you might say, "Ok, but you don't have to say that." And I agree, it was unnecessary.

366
00:27:22.060 --> 00:27:25.340
He didn't need to say that. He didn't need to single her out and comment on her appearance.

367
00:27:25.710 --> 00:27:30.680
Sure, bro. But why not just.. If it was so horrible what he said,

368
00:27:30.680 --> 00:27:35.400
If it was so disrespectful and just horrific what he said.

369
00:27:35.400 --> 00:27:40.310
Why not just sit there and let the room feel that? He makes this joke, why not just sit there?

370
00:27:41.230 --> 00:27:45.870
Why do you need to react? Let the room feel that and let him sit in that disgusting thing he just said.

371
00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:50.040
The embarrassment alone is enough punishment for him.

372
00:27:50.040 --> 00:27:55.780
And you maintain your dignity and your self-respect by showing everyone.

373
00:27:55.870 --> 00:28:00.540
Yeah, he said that. But so fucking what? I'm tall, dark, handsome, rich, famous.

374
00:28:00.540 --> 00:28:04.440
I got a beautiful wife. We're both successful entertainers. I'm about to win an Oscar tonight.

375
00:28:04.440 --> 00:28:11.900
I don't give a fuck what you got to say. To me. That's the way you handle that situation.

376
00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:15.110
Somebody who respects themselves and knows who they are

377
00:28:15.390 --> 00:28:18.530
And is not affected by the fucking petty little comments that people make.

378
00:28:18.800 --> 00:28:26.280
That's how you handle that situation. This is my opinion, you know, so I just think it's weird.

379
00:28:26.280 --> 00:28:29.250
Of course, everyone has their own opinion, but it's just weird to me how people pick

380
00:28:29.250 --> 00:28:34.090
And choose and change the definition of right and wrong depending on who we're talking about.

381
00:28:37.140 --> 00:28:38.950
Because if it was somebody that you didn't like or respect,

382
00:28:38.950 --> 00:28:44.670
You'd be ready to fucking end that man's career and possibly his life for doing what he did, right?

383
00:28:45.050 --> 00:28:49.160
Take the Oscar back from him. Cancel him. Never invite him back to the academy.

384
00:28:49.420 --> 00:28:52.430
Stop watching his movies. Boycott Will Smith.

385
00:28:52.550 --> 00:28:55.780
Or boycott this person I don't like because he did something I don't like.

386
00:28:55.880 --> 00:29:06.540
Tell me I'm wrong, bro. Tell me I'm wrong. It was.. It was a weird moment, man. It was weird.

387
00:29:06.590 --> 00:29:11.140
I mean, unfortunately, I didn't, like, write down what I wanted to say

388
00:29:11.140 --> 00:29:17.480
Before I started recording this because I just wanted to express myself naturally about the subject

389
00:29:17.480 --> 00:29:22.430
And kind of just let my.. Let my mind kind of wander in and out of this subject

390
00:29:22.430 --> 00:29:25.260
Because there's so many different things to talk about, so many different things to consider.

391
00:29:25.570 --> 00:29:27.620
And at the end of the day, it's just a question of opinion, right?

392
00:29:27.620 --> 00:29:30.520
Like you may think that Chris Rock was wrong and he got what he deserved.

393
00:29:30.870 --> 00:29:34.110
You may think he was right and it was no big deal. And the same thing about Will Smith.

394
00:29:34.110 --> 00:29:42.960
We're just talking about opinion here, right? But I don't know. I don't know, man.

395
00:29:43.180 --> 00:29:47.600
I'm trying to look back at these points like, was he out of line? Maybe.

396
00:29:48.010 --> 00:29:51.250
Can you talk about people's illnesses? I think so.

397
00:29:51.400 --> 00:29:54.330
But again, I have a very dark sense of humor, you know what I'm saying?

398
00:29:54.330 --> 00:29:57.370
So I know a lot of people, especially these days, are extremely sensitive.

399
00:29:58.030 --> 00:30:00.800
And, you know, they think there are certain things you can't joke about.

400
00:30:00.850 --> 00:30:04.660
Was it the right place or time? Probably not, because it wasn't a comedy show.

401
00:30:04.660 --> 00:30:07.930
You know, it was the Oscars. Maybe he shouldn't have made that joke. I can agree with that.

402
00:30:08.510 --> 00:30:12.930
But was.. Was it violence? Was what Chris Rock said,

403
00:30:12.930 --> 00:30:15.590
A form of psychological violence or something like that? I don't think so,

404
00:30:15.590 --> 00:30:20.960
Because for somebody to say that that joke was a form of violence, if you believe that,

405
00:30:21.010 --> 00:30:25.590
I just think you don't know what real violence actually is. Maybe you've never experienced real violence.

406
00:30:26.970 --> 00:30:29.440
Like, I've experienced real violence. You know what I'm saying?

407
00:30:30.990 --> 00:30:34.700
I've experienced violence done to me and I've been violent towards somebody else.

408
00:30:34.740 --> 00:30:39.150
And saying that your wife is bald, she looks like G.I. Jane is not violent in any way,

409
00:30:39.150 --> 00:30:43.860
Shape, or form. Now, words can incite violence for sure. But violence?

410
00:30:46.170 --> 00:30:50.560
I think that's a step.. I think that's a slight exaggeration of what happened, but that's just my opinion.

411
00:30:51.130 --> 00:30:56.750
And again, if you believe in free speech, then you have to accept the fact

412
00:30:56.750 --> 00:30:58.790
That people are going to say things that you don't want to hear.

413
00:30:58.830 --> 00:31:05.140
People are going to say things that you don't like. You're going to be disrespected verbally. And that's just life, bro.

414
00:31:05.140 --> 00:31:09.890
Nobody gives a fuck about your feelings the same way you don't give a fuck about everyone's feelings.

415
00:31:09.890 --> 00:31:13.110
It's impossible to take everyone's thoughts and feelings

416
00:31:13.110 --> 00:31:15.730
And experiences into consideration every time you have something to say.

417
00:31:15.730 --> 00:31:22.410
It's ridiculous. It's fucking ridiculous. It's childish. Whatever your political affiliation,

418
00:31:22.410 --> 00:31:26.110
Whoever you are a fan of, it doesn't matter, bro. It doesn't matter.

419
00:31:26.390 --> 00:31:30.900
Take your favorite person out of the situation and then ask yourself, "right or wrong?"

420
00:31:33.090 --> 00:31:40.750
You know what I'm saying? I don't know. I don't know. It was fucking weird.

421
00:31:41.290 --> 00:31:49.590
It's just weird to me how people will get a pass just because you like them.

422
00:31:50.090 --> 00:31:54.120
But if it was somebody else, it would be unacceptable. That's.. That's weird to me.

423
00:31:54.920 --> 00:31:58.840
It's weird to me that people think it's okay to get violent,

424
00:31:58.840 --> 00:32:01.500
Physically violent just because somebody says something you don't like.

425
00:32:02.140 --> 00:32:07.600
It's weird to me that people expect the entire world to change the way that they behave,

426
00:32:07.630 --> 00:32:13.930
The way that they speak, the way that they interact, because they are uncomfortable.

427
00:32:14.970 --> 00:32:18.720
It's like you expect the world to bend to your reality and consider your thoughts and feelings.

428
00:32:19.960 --> 00:32:24.220
Because they're your thoughts and feelings. But nobody's responsible for your thoughts or feelings except you.

429
00:32:26.310 --> 00:32:30.750
Now, I'm not saying you should just be mean, you should just make hurtful jokes, it's okay to disrespect people.

430
00:32:30.750 --> 00:32:34.460
That's not what I'm saying. I'm just saying you're free to say whatever you want

431
00:32:35.260 --> 00:32:38.550
And nobody should have the ability to stop you from doing that.

432
00:32:40.170 --> 00:32:42.470
That's one of the greatest things about.. I'm speaking about the U.S. now.

433
00:32:42.470 --> 00:32:45.060
That's one of the greatest things about this country, is you can say whatever you want.

434
00:32:45.060 --> 00:32:50.700
You can say, "Fuck the president." and nothing will happen. That's the way it should be.

435
00:32:50.890 --> 00:32:56.990
You should be able to say whatever you want. That's just what I think. You know?

436
00:32:57.790 --> 00:33:03.460
So... I feel like at this point I'm going to start being redundant

437
00:33:03.460 --> 00:33:06.600
And repetitive because again, I didn't write what I thought first.

438
00:33:06.600 --> 00:33:09.640
I'm not reading a script or anything like that so I can feel I'm going to start

439
00:33:09.640 --> 00:33:12.660
Going in circles and just keep saying the same thing. So I think I'll stop it there.

440
00:33:13.320 --> 00:33:17.260
And at the end of the day, none of us will ever really know what really happened

441
00:33:17.260 --> 00:33:21.970
Or the motivation for what took place. And more importantly, we'll never know why it happened.

442
00:33:22.300 --> 00:33:25.170
I guess that's kind of the same thing. We'll never know what actually happened

443
00:33:25.400 --> 00:33:28.480
And we'll never know why it happened because all we know is what we saw on television.

444
00:33:28.820 --> 00:33:30.980
None of us know any of these people personally and frankly,

445
00:33:31.010 --> 00:33:33.580
I don't give a fuck about two celebrities fighting on TV.

446
00:33:34.130 --> 00:33:37.230
Now, I know that sounds contradictory and maybe a little hypocritical

447
00:33:37.230 --> 00:33:40.580
When you consider the fact that I did an entire podcast episode about them.

448
00:33:40.870 --> 00:33:44.640
But my interest is simply in the actions that were taken and not the people that took them.

449
00:33:44.640 --> 00:33:50.370
Because let's be honest, if you saw the same scenario between two guys in a grocery store or at the park,

450
00:33:50.830 --> 00:33:54.060
You'd probably tell your friends about it when you got home, right?

451
00:33:54.520 --> 00:33:56.930
You might record it and post it on social media and be like,

452
00:33:56.930 --> 00:33:59.700
"Oh, that's fucking crazy! Look at this!" But after a few days,

453
00:33:59.700 --> 00:34:01.520
You'd probably never talk about it again.

454
00:34:01.520 --> 00:34:06.170
And you certainly wouldn't be talking about it as if you knew those people personally,

455
00:34:06.430 --> 00:34:09.360
The way people are doing with Will, Jada, and Chris. Right?

456
00:34:10.490 --> 00:34:13.870
But anyway, I want to end this episode with another video clip,

457
00:34:14.160 --> 00:34:17.990
And I want you to tell me if there's a difference between what happened at the Oscars

458
00:34:18.570 --> 00:34:20.930
And what happened in this clip right here.

459
00:34:21.480 --> 00:34:24.170
Man, Arsenio, they got rules. They got rules. Like, he has a rule.

460
00:34:24.690 --> 00:34:27.480
The bass player, he got a rule. He's got to wax his head every morning.

461
00:34:27.480 --> 00:34:33.770
That's a rule. He follows the rules, man. He follows the rules.

462
00:34:33.770 --> 00:34:35.960
Oh, these are jokes! Come on!

463
00:34:37.270 --> 00:34:39.500
See, you go too into the characters and got hurt.

Tony Kaizen:
What's up, my friend? You are listening to the Life in
English podcast. I'm your host, Tony Kaizen, and today I'm

2
00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:11.660
going to tell you about a mental issue that is almost
certainly making your life harder than it needs to be. And

3
00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:21.260
that issue is the "action bias". The term

4
00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:28.000
"action bias" refers to our tendency to prefer action to
inaction, even if there's no evidence that doing something

5
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:34.120
is better than doing nothing. You know those situations when
you feel helpless and you say, "Well, I can't just sit here

6
00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:43.740
and do nothing." That is the action bias at work. So how
does it affect us? Well, on an individual level, it causes

7
00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:49.710
us to waste time and energy doing things that have
absolutely no positive impact on the situation. In fact,

8
00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:56.350
there are times when our impulsive need to act ends up
making the situation worse. An example I'm sure most of us

9
00:00:56.350 --> 00:01:03.040
have experienced is when we're stuck in a traffic jam on the
freeway. I mean, you know how it is. Every single car is

10
00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:09.280
going three miles per hour at most. Countless cars are
trying to merge onto the freeway and every time traffic

11
00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:15.400
stops or someone tries to merge, some jackass feels the need
to honk his horn repeatedly, as if that's somehow going to

12
00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:23.070
make the situation better. The action bias compels this
jackass to honk his horn because the idea of doing nothing

13
00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:31.780
in such a frustrating situation is unacceptable to him. He
says to himself, "I bet if I just keep honking the horn, the

14
00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:38.770
entire freeway will part like the Red Sea, and I'll be able
to drive straight home." But what usually happens is the

15
00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:45.210
jackass gets cut off in traffic, he honks his horn
excessively, then he sees that the honking is doing nothing

16
00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:51.730
but by that time, he's already angry and possessed by his
need to act so he furiously follows the car that cut him off

17
00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:56.820
until it stops. Then he gets out of his car and tries to
attack the driver, for example:

18
00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:03.900
Reporter:
"Houston police got a call shortly before 9 am.
Investigators say a man was driving this white truck down

19
00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:10.830
Airport Boulevard near Mykawa when a red truck cut him off.
They say the man in the white truck then tried to catch up

20
00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:18.110
to the red truck, but witnesses told police he caught up to
the wrong red truck and he began following the truck. Inside

21
00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:23.720
that truck was a woman taking her eight-year-old son to
school. When they reached the stoplight at Airport and

22
00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:30.360
Telephone Road, investigators say the man got out of his
vehicle with a metal rod and broke the rear window of the

23
00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:36.520
woman's truck. They say that's when the woman in the red
truck pulled out her pistol and shot the man once in the

24
00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:36.910
arm."

25
00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:44.370
Houston Police Detective:
"One male victim was shot. Uh, he has been transported to
the, uh, local hospital, like, in critical but stable

26
00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:48.170
condition. I do believe at this time he will...he is
expected to survive."

27
00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:53.860
Reporter:
"The woman was detained for questioning and investigators
even asked her to reenact the incident. The alleged

28
00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:58.560
aggressor will survive, but officers have some advice for
those angry drivers:"

29
00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:03.150
Houston Police Detective:
"Try to just let it go. That's all I can say. Just let it
go, because it's not...it's not really...it's not worth it.

30
00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:04.040
Not worth someone's life."

31
00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:14.040
Tony Kaizen:
Now in modern society, doing nothing is typically seen in a
negative light. For example, whenever we witness some form

32
00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:20.250
of social injustice, we say illogical things like, "If you
remain silent and you don't take action, that means you

33
00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:28.020
agree with what is happening." In other words, doing
something is better than doing nothing. Whenever a social

34
00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:33.200
cause goes viral on the internet, every company in the
Western world has to create a marketing campaign and a

35
00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:41.060
fucking hashtag to show that they stand with whatever social
group is being exploited this month. These empty actions

36
00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:50.020
receive praise and applause, even though they're not having
any lasting positive effect on the situation. Why? The

37
00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:57.600
action bias. Now, it's still unclear as to why we've
developed this cognitive bias. Some people believe it was

38
00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:04.270
passed down by our ancestors who lived as hunter gatherers.
Back then, failing to take action could literally mean dying

39
00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:11.210
of thirst, starvation, or predators attack. So this impulse
to take action is in some way a survival tactic, depending

40
00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:16.860
on how you look at it. But the problem with this bias is
that we don't really need it to survive as much as we did in

41
00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:24.760
the past. Now, others believe our need to take action comes
from our need to feel like we're in control. When we take

42
00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:31.320
action, it feels like we're having an impact. It feels like
progress. And when we do nothing, we feel helpless and it

43
00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:37.800
feels like we've given up. In other words, doing something
makes us feel better about ourselves than doing nothing,

44
00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:45.950
which further reinforces this habit of acting impulsively. 
Now, some believe this bias is continuously reinforced by

45
00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:52.770
society. There are so many situations in which those who
take action are rewarded while those who do nothing are

46
00:04:52.900 --> 00:05:01.550
punished. For example, if a woman is being harassed in the
street, the man who steps in to protect her is a hero. And

47
00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:09.090
the men who sit by and watch are shameful cowards. Students
who participate in class are often favored by their teachers

48
00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:16.880
and get better grades, while the quiet ones often get
ignored and left behind. In society, you're seen as a loser

49
00:05:16.970 --> 00:05:25.320
if you never do anything with your life. We applaud those
who do. We praise people's accomplishments.

50
00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:32.370
We chant their names and we give them lifetime achievement
awards. This only further reinforces the idea that the way

51
00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:39.820
to get respect, praise, and admiration is by doing
something, especially if you're a man. A man who does

52
00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:47.960
nothing is called a bum. He has no utility and therefore he
has no value in society. And once we internalise this

53
00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:55.010
illogical idea, we allow it to influence all of our
decisions. We're motivated by our fear of being a loser or

54
00:05:55.010 --> 00:06:00.810
losing control of the situation. We feel the need to take
action at times when doing nothing is probably the best

55
00:06:00.810 --> 00:06:09.280
choice. In episode 94 of this podcast, I posed the question,
"How long are you going to watch?" And I was implying that

56
00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:17.330
you must take action; you must participate in the game of
life. But the reality is, my idea of a good life may be

57
00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:25.040
different from yours. I mean, who's to say that you have to
do something with your life? Some people are content with

58
00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:31.330
observing. Some people are content with staying still. And
whether that's good or bad is really up for them to decide.

59
00:06:32.930 --> 00:06:39.260
So in summary, the true origin of this cognitive bias is
still a mystery, but it seems that it's part nature and part

60
00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:46.610
nurture like many human behaviors. But you might be sitting
there asking yourself, "Why should I care? Why does this

61
00:06:46.610 --> 00:06:54.800
matter?" Well, we typically equate action with productivity,
and productivity is also something we tend to value very

62
00:06:54.800 --> 00:07:02.480
highly. However, doing nothing can often be better and more
productive than doing something. Now, let's go back to the

63
00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:08.700
example of the traffic jam. You're in bumper-to-bumper
traffic on the highway, right? You're going three miles per

64
00:07:08.790 --> 00:07:16.580
hour and you still got 30 miles to go. You can do the math
on that one. So naturally, you start to get frustrated and

65
00:07:16.580 --> 00:07:22.320
you decide to get off at the next exit so you can take a
faster route home. But that decision quickly backfires when

66
00:07:22.320 --> 00:07:28.730
you realize that there's more traffic on the city streets
than there was on the highway. You end up making more stops,

67
00:07:29.060 --> 00:07:34.990
more turns, and driving a longer distance just to get home.
And all of that means you used more gas, which means you

68
00:07:34.990 --> 00:07:42.490
spent more money. So logic tells us that staying on the
highway is more efficient, but getting off the highway makes

69
00:07:42.490 --> 00:07:50.690
us feel better. When we sit in traffic, we feel like we're
getting nowhere. We feel helpless amidst the endless sea of

70
00:07:50.690 --> 00:07:59.170
automobiles that won't just get out of our way. But when we
get off the highway, we can drive at a regular speed. We're

71
00:07:59.170 --> 00:08:04.630
not stuck in the same spot for minutes at a time. We feel
like we're taking the situation into our own hands and

72
00:08:04.630 --> 00:08:12.430
having a positive impact. But the most productive thing to
do is actually nothing at all. The most logical thing to do

73
00:08:12.430 --> 00:08:19.370
in rush hour traffic is to accept the fact that you cannot
outsmart rush hour traffic. So you should care about

74
00:08:19.370 --> 00:08:24.480
cognitive biases like these because being aware of them
enables us to make more productive decisions that are based

75
00:08:24.480 --> 00:08:32.300
on logic instead of impulsive feelings. In other words, we
can train ourselves to do what makes sense and not just what

76
00:08:32.300 --> 00:08:39.410
feels good in the moment. And there are many times when we
don't know exactly what to do. And our automatic response to

77
00:08:39.410 --> 00:08:44.990
that feeling of indecision is often to take action without
even considering the possibility that it would be better to

78
00:08:44.990 --> 00:08:54.290
do nothing. This affects us on a personal and societal level
alike. Whether you're in traffic, at school, or at work, the

79
00:08:54.290 --> 00:09:00.940
action bias will be present. You will find it in government
buildings where public policies are made. You will find it

80
00:09:00.940 --> 00:09:08.350
in doctors' offices where diagnoses are given. You will find
it in investment firms where money is put at risk. And we

81
00:09:08.350 --> 00:09:13.710
don't know exactly how this bias was developed, but it seems
clear that we as a society continue to reinforce it by

82
00:09:13.710 --> 00:09:21.540
rewarding those who take action and punishing those who
don't. If we're not careful, this cognitive bias can land us

83
00:09:21.540 --> 00:09:27.600
in some very senseless, unproductive situations simply
because we feel incapable of sitting back and letting things

84
00:09:27.600 --> 00:09:35.410
happen. Our desperate need for control could be the very
thing that causes us to lose it. We've got to be more

85
00:09:35.410 --> 00:09:42.510
cognizant of our faulty logic so we can begin to overcome it
and make more productive and efficient decisions. But

86
00:09:42.510 --> 00:09:48.750
developing this skill is a longterm process that requires us
to cultivate an incredible level of self-control. And

87
00:09:48.750 --> 00:09:55.440
there's no easy way to do this. In my experience, you simply
got to pay much more attention to your impulsive feelings

88
00:09:55.930 --> 00:10:02.060
and then get in the habit of pausing and taking a moment to
really think about what you're feeling in that moment.

89
00:10:03.370 --> 00:10:07.540
Before you can decide what you're going to do about your
feelings, it's best to understand where the feelings are

90
00:10:07.540 --> 00:10:17.000
coming from, or in other words, why you feel the way you do.
You tend to do things based on the way you feel.

91
00:10:17.840 --> 00:10:24.100
So if you never understand why you feel the way you do, you
will never understand why you do the things you do. You

92
00:10:24.560 --> 00:10:33.110
understand? I want you to imagine a scenario with me:
Imagine walking down the street and seeing a man slap

93
00:10:33.110 --> 00:10:37.560
himself in the face repeatedly. Slap, slap, slap.

94
00:10:37.840 --> 00:10:46.280
Again and again. And naturally, this confuses you so you
walk up to him and you ask, "Why are you doing that?" And

95
00:10:46.280 --> 00:10:56.220
the man pauses for a second. And he looks at you with a
straight face and says, "I don't know." That's

96
00:10:56.220 --> 00:11:01.190
what you look like when you allow yourself to be controlled
by impulsive feeling instead of using a logical thought

97
00:11:01.190 --> 00:11:07.330
process to make decisions. You look like the guy on the
street corner who's slapping himself for no reason, unable

98
00:11:07.330 --> 00:11:14.860
to figure out why his face hurts so fucking much. But once
you realize you're slapping yourself and you stop to think

99
00:11:15.370 --> 00:11:21.590
about why you're doing it, you might realize that deep down,
you just want to see yourself in pain so you impulsively do

100
00:11:21.590 --> 00:11:29.210
these stupid things that you subconsciously know will only
bring you more pain. Now, with this newfound knowledge, you

101
00:11:29.210 --> 00:11:34.680
could begin to monitor your feelings with a more educated
eye and start to notice what triggers those impulsive

102
00:11:34.680 --> 00:11:41.270
feelings. Once you identify the triggers, you can begin to
remove them from your life or at least develop a better,

103
00:11:41.270 --> 00:11:48.330
more logical response to those triggers. One that's actually
productive and in your best interest, as opposed to one that

104
00:11:48.330 --> 00:11:56.190
just feels good in the moment. And the point is not to favor
doing nothing over doing something. I'm not saying we should

105
00:11:56.190 --> 00:11:57.630
glorify inaction.

106
00:11:58.560 --> 00:12:05.630
I'm saying that we should develop the habit of pausing to
think before we act on impulse. There are times when

107
00:12:05.630 --> 00:12:13.060
decisive action is necessary, but there are also many times
when doing nothing is absolutely the best choice. And the

108
00:12:13.060 --> 00:12:18.800
only way we can learn to identify these situations is by
paying closer attention to the motives behind our actions

109
00:12:19.010 --> 00:12:28.420
and even more importantly, the possible outcomes. I want to
thank you for your time and attention, my friend.

110
00:12:28.420 --> 00:12:33.020
I really hope this episode is giving you something
interesting to think about. And you already know, this is

111
00:12:33.020 --> 00:12:38.720
the Life in English podcast. I am your host, Tony Kaizen,
and I'll talk to you soon. Peace!

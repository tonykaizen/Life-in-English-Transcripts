00:00:00.049 --> 00:00:06.539
Do not, do not, do not be afraid to feel like a fucking idiot.

00:00:11.774 --> 00:00:12.504
What's up, my friends?

00:00:12.504 --> 00:00:15.104
This is Coffee with Kaizen number 25.

00:00:15.104 --> 00:00:16.364
We finally made it.

00:00:16.364 --> 00:00:18.584
It has been a month officially.

00:00:18.584 --> 00:00:25.844
This is episode 25 out of 25 that I've committed to making for this Coffee with Kaizen experiment.

00:00:25.874 --> 00:00:27.254
Very happy to be here today.

00:00:27.644 --> 00:00:33.039
It's been a very interesting process, recording all these episodes, pretty much every day for the past month.

00:00:33.489 --> 00:00:40.209
And, um, today we're talking about, really, today's episode is kind of like a continuation of yesterday's episode.

00:00:40.209 --> 00:00:43.059
When I talked about how idioms are for idiots.

00:00:43.269 --> 00:00:46.299
Now, if you haven't heard that episode, I recommend you go check it out.

00:00:46.299 --> 00:00:48.369
I think it's like six or seven minutes.

00:00:48.729 --> 00:00:53.319
And it's not meant to be taken seriously when I say idioms are for idiots, all right.

00:00:53.649 --> 00:01:05.574
I'm pretty sure I made that clear in the episode, but anyway, today's episode is a continuation of that, and I'm not
talking about idioms per se, but like the title, I'm talking about how you shouldn't be afraid to feel like an idiot.

00:01:05.754 --> 00:01:08.424
It's actually very important that you feel like an idiot.

00:01:08.424 --> 00:01:09.594
And I'm going to explain why.

00:01:09.924 --> 00:01:11.154
All right, so let's just get into it.

00:01:12.114 --> 00:01:18.324
I'll talk many times before about the methods I use to learn Spanish and Portuguese, basically without leaving my home.

00:01:18.954 --> 00:01:26.064
And once you have an effective study method is really just a question of time
and practice before you reach a level of fluency that you feel comfortable with.

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:28.840
And you don't need to spend a thousand dollars to make that happen.

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:39.130
However, one thing I don't think I've talked too much about is the fact that if you
don't use all the language that you've managed to learn, you will definitely lose it.

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:42.435
I'm not talking about the words and phrases you learned last week.

00:01:42.675 --> 00:01:46.845
Although if you don't put that vocabulary into practice, you'll lose it as well.

00:01:47.265 --> 00:01:52.155
I'm talking about the language that you or I, in this case learned over five years ago.

00:01:53.205 --> 00:01:58.605
After reaching an advanced level in Spanish, back in 2016, I started learning Portuguese.

00:01:59.385 --> 00:02:05.505
After a few months, I had to stop speaking Spanish completely because I kept getting the two languages confused in my head.

00:02:06.225 --> 00:02:11.235
And this was a good decision at the time, because it's important to focus on one language at a time.

00:02:11.955 --> 00:02:19.735
Now, over the next few years, I became very comfortable with speaking Portuguese;
so much so that aspect of myself in Portuguese, about 40% of the time.

00:02:20.495 --> 00:02:27.240
However, in that same amount of time, I feel like I've lost almost all of my ability to communicate in Spanish.

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:35.700
Now, I still understand it very well, but it's as if all of the things
that I had learned a few years ago simply disappeared from my memory.

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:37.650
Just gone.

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:39.690
But why am I telling you this?

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:44.510
Well, I recently met this Spanish speaker who's really interested in improving her English skills.

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:54.940
And I've been wanting to get back to practicing my Spanish skills for a while, but I had
been avoiding it simply because it's so difficult to find a good language exchange partner.

00:02:55.790 --> 00:03:03.680
So when the opportunity to do a language exchange with this girl presented itself, I took
full advantage by simply asking her if she wanted to speak with me a few times a week.

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:07.850
So she accepted my offer and we've been talking almost every day for a couple of weeks now.

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:11.570
And that brings me to the point of this episode.

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:19.070
For the past few weeks, I've been feeling like a complete fucking idiot every time I try to talk to this girl in Spanish.

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:26.885
I have to search in my memory for the basic words and the most basic phrases, and it really feels like I'm seven years old again.

00:03:26.885 --> 00:03:29.735
And I just can't express myself clearly.

00:03:30.555 --> 00:03:37.685
I'm sure at some point you found yourself trying to have a conversation
with a native speaker and you were just struggling to say simple things.

00:03:38.285 --> 00:03:40.835
You have to keep stopping to think about what you want to say.

00:03:41.135 --> 00:03:43.235
You know, how you're going to say it and things like that.

00:03:43.475 --> 00:03:48.365
And meanwhile, the person who's listening to you is just kind of, like, sitting there looking at you.

00:03:48.875 --> 00:03:49.225
Right?

00:03:50.205 --> 00:04:01.670
The person is probably patient and understanding, mainly because they know you're not a native speaker,
but in your mind, it feels like to hate you because you're stupid and you're wasting their time.

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:05.090
And you just, you can't fucking say simple things.

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:06.800
What the fuck is wrong with you, man?

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:08.660
That's how it feels, right?

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:15.680
Like one second passes, five seconds that passed when you're trying to find a word in this foreign language, it feels like 50 minutes.

00:04:16.475 --> 00:04:18.545
You know, that's really what it feels like.

00:04:18.995 --> 00:04:25.505
Now, although this isn't the best feeling in the world, I think it's really important to feel like a fucking idiot from time to time.

00:04:26.345 --> 00:04:26.975
I really do.

00:04:27.675 --> 00:04:28.235
Understand that.

00:04:28.235 --> 00:04:31.115
I don't mean you should be an idiot.

00:04:31.385 --> 00:04:31.775
Okay.

00:04:31.955 --> 00:04:32.975
Just feel like one.

00:04:33.665 --> 00:04:37.205
Let me explain what I mean by using the same example, a language exchange.

00:04:37.805 --> 00:04:47.690
If you're trying to express yourself to a native speaker and you find that you feel like a seven year old
kid that doesn't know how to express oneself, it'll probably make you feel slightly stupid and insecure.

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:49.970
How could that be a good thing?

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:54.650
Well, first of all, it's a great way to get your ego in check.

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:55.490
Let me say that again.

00:04:55.730 --> 00:04:59.990
It's a great way to get your ego in check.

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:06.830
It's easy to get comfortable and feel confident saying whatever we want in our native language, even if we're saying something stupid.

00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:09.560
We just feel like we're in control.

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:19.115
But when you're reduced to the vocabulary of a child, you might remember that you
don't know everything, you might feel like you've lost control of the situation.

00:05:19.355 --> 00:05:22.145
And that's an uncomfortable feeling indeed.

00:05:22.685 --> 00:05:23.015
Right?

00:05:24.295 --> 00:05:28.175
Now, this is a good thing because you're forced to consider your actions before you take them.

00:05:29.105 --> 00:05:32.765
You'll also see that everyone knows something you don't.

00:05:33.965 --> 00:05:35.495
Everyone has an advantage over you.

00:05:35.795 --> 00:05:37.715
And I don't say that in the sense of competition.

00:05:37.985 --> 00:05:41.125
I say that in the sense that you can learn something from everyone meet.

00:05:41.475 --> 00:05:52.670
So by being the idiot or the fool, you put yourself in a position not only to remain humble,
but also to learn more than you ever could have imagined much more than you could have learned

00:05:52.970 --> 00:05:57.050
if you were too busy thinking you're smarter and more capable than everyone around you.

00:05:58.950 --> 00:06:04.280
You can get an idea of the size of a man's ego by his willingness to be the idiot.

00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:08.630
The one that doesn't know anything, the one that has to take the risks and make the mistakes.

00:06:08.750 --> 00:06:11.990
The one that has to be corrected, the one that has to be laughed at.

00:06:13.010 --> 00:06:13.370
You see?

00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:22.235
If a man or a woman, obviously is not willing to do these things, it's most likely because their ego is the one that's in control.

00:06:23.225 --> 00:06:30.005
It's been a long time since they've been forced out of their comfort
zone and they have no interest in leaving that comfort zone anytime soon.

00:06:31.385 --> 00:06:34.085
Their sense of self-importance is too valuable to them.

00:06:34.685 --> 00:06:36.965
Their self-image is too fragile.

00:06:37.925 --> 00:06:43.205
And this is obviously just my opinion, but whether you agree with me or not, it's something to be considered.

00:06:44.755 --> 00:06:48.025
So do not be afraid to feel like a fucking idiot.

00:06:48.865 --> 00:06:49.195
Okay.

00:06:49.855 --> 00:06:53.935
It's in those moments that you have the greatest potential to learn something new.

00:06:55.535 --> 00:06:55.875
Peace.

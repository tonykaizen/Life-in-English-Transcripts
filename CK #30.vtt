1
00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:01.690
What's up, my friend?

2
00:00:01.690 --> 00:00:03.730
This is Coffee with Kaizen number 30.

3
00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:08.450
And in this episode, you're going to learn English with some contemporary R&B music.

4
00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:20.290
All right, my friend.

5
00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:22.990
Today we're going to be listening to a song from the super popular

6
00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:27.190
American R&B singer Jhené Aiko from Los Angeles, California.

7
00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:31.580
She's got a smooth and calming voice, and she makes that type of laidback music that you can listen to

8
00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:33.510
While you're cruising around the city. You know what I'm saying?

9
00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:38.930
So if you're into contemporary R&B, then I highly recommend you check out some of her music when you get the chance.

10
00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.690
Now, today we're going to listen to one of her most popular songs, which is B.S.

11
00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:47.840
And it features another popular R&B singer named H.E.R. That's actually her name, H.E.R.

12
00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:52.930
And those letters represent the words having everything revealed, just in case you were wondering.

13
00:00:53.610 --> 00:01:00.050
Anyway, in this song, Jhené and H.E.R sing about bouncing back from a failed relationship and feeling an abundance of confidence,

14
00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:03.890
Knowing that they'll be fine without their exes. That's the main idea of the song.

15
00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:06.000
Now, as always, I'm going to play the entire song,

16
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.540
And then I'll explain any and all words and phrases that might be useful for you to know.

17
00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:13.590
I think you're going to learn lots of vocabulary and American slang in this episode.

18
00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:16.580
So, let's get started!

19
00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:22.400
Yeah

20
00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:24.080
Yeah

21
00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:39.910
Back up on my

22
00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:46.580
Done dealing with you

23
00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:47.390
Yeah

24
00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:49.810
Back up on my bullshit

25
00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:51.080
Back up on the scene

26
00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:52.660
Done dealing with you

27
00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:54.620
Don't know how to deal with me

28
00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:58.040
Done fuckin' with you, don't know how to love me

29
00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:01.110
Done dealing with you, so I'm back

30
00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:05.690
It seem like I give so much and don't get nothin' back

31
00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:09.220
I really thought it was love but you're so fuckin' whack

32
00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:12.750
Always get caught up in love, but I am done with that

33
00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:16.120
I can't get caught up in lust, so now I'm, yeah

34
00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:19.730
Flexin' on my exes in my model X

35
00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:23.280
Pretty little skinny, little bitty body model-esque

36
00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:26.440
Some of y'all ain't never had no real bitch and it shows

37
00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:29.990
I keep it one hunnid from my head down to my toes

38
00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:31.890
Back up on my bullshit

39
00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:33.480
Back up on the move

40
00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:37.230
Touch down in my hometown, got nothing to lose

41
00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:40.410
I am on my own now, I am in control now

42
00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:44.020
I need you to go now, I can fix my own crown

43
00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:46.290
Back up on my bullshit

44
00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:47.600
Back up on the scene

45
00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:49.410
Done dealing with you

46
00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:51.080
Don't know how to deal with me

47
00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:54.610
Done fuckin' with you, don't know how to love me

48
00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:58.650
Done dealing with you, so I'm back, yeah (bitch)

49
00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:02.940
Seen you with your ex, I see you still about your old ways

50
00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:06.340
Might just see him for the weekend, you say that's a cold play

51
00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:09.840
I be feelin' triggered, I don't know how to let it go

52
00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:15.120
Really, you ain't shit and I know I'm too emotional, ay, ay

53
00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:16.900
Puttin' me through it

54
00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:20.670
He's the only thing that's been gettin' me through it

55
00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:22.300
He be comin' through with it

56
00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:24.100
And I hope you cool with it

57
00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:28.630
I just met your roommate, put him on my to-do list

58
00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:29.910
Doin' me

59
00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:33.530
Back up on some new shit, everything in between

60
00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:35.520
I'm out here, I'm gettin' stupid

61
00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:37.450
I'm done bein' exclusive and

62
00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:40.800
You know the truth is that these niggas is useless

63
00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:41.850
I'm back on my

64
00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:42.820
Back up on my bullshit

65
00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:44.100
Back up on the scene

66
00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:47.630
Out here actin' foolish, like I'm seventeen

67
00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:51.620
I just bought a new whip, don't need gasoline (yeah)

68
00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:54.720
I just seen your new bitch, it boost my self-esteem (oh babe)

69
00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:56.630
Back up on my bullshit

70
00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:58.220
Back up on the scene

71
00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:00.010
Done dealing with you

72
00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:01.610
Don't know how to deal with me

73
00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:05.200
Done fuckin' with you, don't know how to love me

74
00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:09.960
Done dealing with you, so I'm back, yeah (bitch)

75
00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:13.170
Flex on my ex in my model X

76
00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:16.730
Flex on my ex in my model X

77
00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:24.340
Flex on my, flex on my

78
00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:27.510
Flex on my

79
00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:35.760
(You know I'm) Back up on my bullshit

80
00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:38.860
I'm back up on the scene

81
00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:41.250
Oh, I

82
00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:44.670
Done dealing with you, so I'm back

83
00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:57.150
All right, my friend.

84
00:04:57.610 --> 00:05:01.300
So hopefully, you enjoyed the song. One of my favorites, it's a really good one.

85
00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:06.160
So now we're going to go to the song not line by line like we've done in the past,

86
00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:08.110
Because not everything here needs to be explained.

87
00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:12.970
So instead of playing the song lines and then explaining and then playing a line and then explaining it,

88
00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:18.450
I'm just going to go through and kind of read the lines and explain, you know, only what's necessary.

89
00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:20.040
Alright my friend, so let's get started.

90
00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:28.940
So in the intro, or excuse me, the chorus and chorus is C H O R U S, chorus, and that's also known as the hook.

91
00:05:29.890 --> 00:05:31.190
And it's the main idea of the song.

92
00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:35.180
It's the idea that gets repeated at the beginning, in the middle, and at the end of the song.

93
00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:38.450
So she starts by saying, "back up on my bullshit".

94
00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:40.020
It's really the first line of the song.

95
00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:45.500
So what I want to explain here is first "back up on".

96
00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:49.780
This one is really complicated because it's like a culture... It's a colloquial way of speaking.

97
00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:55.670
Back up on my bullshit. So to be back, in this case, means to have returned. Right?

98
00:05:55.670 --> 00:06:01.310
Like, you go to the store and then you come back or I come to your house and then I go back home.

99
00:06:01.310 --> 00:06:02.880
It's like the idea of returning somewhere.

100
00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:08.070
So back up on my bullshit, it's like, literally it makes no sense,

101
00:06:08.110 --> 00:06:16.350
But colloquially makes perfect sense when we say "back up on my bullshit" without trying to make sense of the reason we say "up on".

102
00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:19.970
Let me just tell you the idea of to be back up on something,

103
00:06:19.970 --> 00:06:26.070
It means I have returned to whatever comes next and what comes next in that line is my bullshit.

104
00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:29.670
So she's really saying I have returned to my bullshit.

105
00:06:30.010 --> 00:06:32.830
Translating into standard simple English, that's what it means.

106
00:06:32.830 --> 00:06:42.020
Now "my bullshit" is like a way of saying my nonsense, my toxic behavior, my childish behavior, my negative.

107
00:06:42.650 --> 00:06:44.550
Not necessarily... Well, yeah, negative behavior.

108
00:06:46.090 --> 00:06:50.410
Yeah, really just nonsense, ridiculous behavior, stuff like that, unproductive, unhealthy behavior.

109
00:06:50.410 --> 00:06:51.550
All of that is my bullshit.

110
00:06:52.130 --> 00:06:53.290
So I'm back up on my bullshit.

111
00:06:53.290 --> 00:06:58.520
I'm back up on, you know, or I have returned to my old ways.

112
00:06:59.540 --> 00:07:00.380
That's really the idea.

113
00:07:00.380 --> 00:07:02.040
That's the idea of this song. You know what I'm saying?

114
00:07:02.040 --> 00:07:03.850
So it's important to understand that line.

115
00:07:04.210 --> 00:07:06.230
So the next line, she says, "back up on the scene".

116
00:07:07.170 --> 00:07:10.440
So again, hopefully now you get the idea, even if you don't understand exactly.

117
00:07:10.440 --> 00:07:12.540
Hopefully you get the idea of back up on.

118
00:07:12.810 --> 00:07:15.140
So the second line is "back up on the scene",

119
00:07:15.630 --> 00:07:18.970
And the scene in this case is like the dating scene. You know what I'm saying?

120
00:07:18.970 --> 00:07:24.030
Because we might say to be on the scene means to be present at a particular location.

121
00:07:24.510 --> 00:07:29.230
But in this case, the scene, like I said, it's more like the dating scene.

122
00:07:29.630 --> 00:07:32.330
Because again, like I said before the song started,

123
00:07:32.330 --> 00:07:40.190
This song is really about bouncing back from a breakup or recovering from a breakup and being fine without your ex.

124
00:07:40.220 --> 00:07:42.280
So when she says, "I'm back up on the scene" it's like,

125
00:07:42.280 --> 00:07:46.640
I just broke up with my ex, I'm single now. I'm back up on the dating scene. I'm available.

126
00:07:46.980 --> 00:07:50.970
I'm back up on my bullshit. I'm ready to, you know... I don't want to be...

127
00:07:51.140 --> 00:07:53.830
I'm done being exclusive. You see what I'm saying? That's the idea.

128
00:07:54.990 --> 00:07:56.900
So after that, she says, "done dealing with you".

129
00:07:56.900 --> 00:07:59.070
And what I want to explain here is "dealing with".

130
00:07:59.550 --> 00:08:05.660
To deal with somebody, in this case, is like to be occupied by somebody.

131
00:08:05.980 --> 00:08:09.250
So, you know, like me and my girl, for example,

132
00:08:09.250 --> 00:08:13.260
I'm dealing with her and only her. I'm dating her and only her.

133
00:08:13.260 --> 00:08:17.550
Like, she's the one that occupies my time, my attention, my energy, all that type of stuff.

134
00:08:17.550 --> 00:08:22.920
I'm dealing with her. She's got me occupied, not some other girl, not any other girl. You see what I'm saying?

135
00:08:22.920 --> 00:08:24.980
So when she says, "I'm done dealing with you", it's like,

136
00:08:24.980 --> 00:08:30.210
I'm done letting you occupy my time and attention. Right?

137
00:08:30.570 --> 00:08:33.410
I'm not going to deal with you anymore. So that's the idea.

138
00:08:34.200 --> 00:08:38.680
And next, she says, "Don't know how to deal with me" which is a continuation of what she said.

139
00:08:38.680 --> 00:08:42.480
She said "I'm done dealing with you because you don't know how to deal with me". Right?

140
00:08:42.480 --> 00:08:44.520
So maybe I can explain in a different way.

141
00:08:44.520 --> 00:08:48.400
She's saying, I'm done letting you occupy my time and attention because you don't know how to treat me.

142
00:08:48.530 --> 00:08:51.070
Because to deal with somebody also means to treat them in a certain way.

143
00:08:51.610 --> 00:08:57.210
So she's saying, I'm done talking to you, dating you, dealing with you because you don't know how to deal with me,

144
00:08:57.210 --> 00:09:00.330
You don't know how to treat me or handle me with care. Right?

145
00:09:00.860 --> 00:09:03.590
And then she says, "Done fucking with you. Don't know how to love me".

146
00:09:04.240 --> 00:09:06.210
So it's kind of saying, you know, the same thing twice.

147
00:09:06.210 --> 00:09:08.310
I'm done dealing with you because you don't know how to deal with me.

148
00:09:08.660 --> 00:09:11.190
I'm done fucking with you because you don't know how to love me.

149
00:09:11.190 --> 00:09:14.110
And to fuck with somebody is similar to deal with somebody.

150
00:09:14.110 --> 00:09:17.210
If I'm fucking with you it means that I'm spending time with you,

151
00:09:17.940 --> 00:09:20.390
You're occupying my attention and stuff like that.

152
00:09:21.640 --> 00:09:25.780
We interact on a regular basis like friends or, in this case, a boyfriend or girlfriend or whatever.

153
00:09:26.180 --> 00:09:28.660
If I'm done fucking with you, means I don't want to talk to you anymore,

154
00:09:28.660 --> 00:09:31.020
I don't want to spend time with you anymore or nothing like that.

155
00:09:31.020 --> 00:09:35.660
I don't fuck with you. I don't like you. That's the idea. All right?

156
00:09:35.660 --> 00:09:36.550
So that's really the chorus.

157
00:09:36.580 --> 00:09:37.740
Back up on my bullshit.

158
00:09:38.080 --> 00:09:38.940
Back up on the scene

159
00:09:39.300 --> 00:09:40.140
Done dealing with you

160
00:09:40.140 --> 00:09:41.330
Don't know how to deal with me

161
00:09:41.730 --> 00:09:42.620
Done fucking with you

162
00:09:42.620 --> 00:09:43.680
Don't know how to love me

163
00:09:44.210 --> 00:09:45.180
I'm done dealing with you

164
00:09:45.550 --> 00:09:46.080
So I'm back

165
00:09:46.240 --> 00:09:50.140
That's the chorus. All right? So now, let's move on to verse one.

166
00:09:51.350 --> 00:09:52.980
Verse one, Jhené is singing.

167
00:09:53.570 --> 00:09:58.200
So the first line, she says, "it seem like I give so much and don't get nothing back".

168
00:09:59.300 --> 00:10:02.810
Now the only things I want to explain here are questions of grammar.

169
00:10:03.010 --> 00:10:07.940
Because she said "it seem like", but "it" is the third person singular, right?

170
00:10:07.940 --> 00:10:13.010
So you should say "it seems like I give so much and don't get nothing back".

171
00:10:13.010 --> 00:10:17.020
So that's the second part I want to explain. Don't get nothing back.

172
00:10:18.260 --> 00:10:23.730
Again, in standard English, this is grammatically incorrect because it's the double negative, right?

173
00:10:23.730 --> 00:10:26.840
I do not get nothing. We don't do that in standard English.

174
00:10:27.210 --> 00:10:29.880
You don't have two negatives in the same sentence. Like, not and nothing.

175
00:10:30.220 --> 00:10:31.880
You would say "I don't get anything back".

176
00:10:32.790 --> 00:10:34.430
That's like correct standard English.

177
00:10:34.950 --> 00:10:38.020
But this phrase right here, Jhené is speaking what we call Ebonics,

178
00:10:38.310 --> 00:10:40.980
Or Black English or African-American Vernacular English.

179
00:10:40.980 --> 00:10:44.950
There's many different names for it, but it's just not standard English.

180
00:10:44.950 --> 00:10:48.550
It's a different dialect with its own rules and patterns of speech and stuff like that.

181
00:10:48.860 --> 00:10:52.750
So it's very common for us to conjugate all verbs the same way.

182
00:10:53.550 --> 00:10:57.500
I seem, you seem, she seem, we seem, it seem, they seem. You see what I'm saying?

183
00:10:57.950 --> 00:10:59.070
And then "don't get nothing".

184
00:10:59.630 --> 00:11:05.400
The double negative in Ebonics is totally normal. It's standard to us. Right?

185
00:11:05.950 --> 00:11:07.530
So in standard English, it's incorrect.

186
00:11:07.530 --> 00:11:12.600
But in Ebonics, it's totally fine, it's correct. It makes perfect sense. You see what I'm saying?

187
00:11:12.600 --> 00:11:16.850
So now the meaning of the phrase. It seems like I give so much and don't get nothing back.

188
00:11:17.450 --> 00:11:18.630
She's talking about in the relationship,

189
00:11:18.670 --> 00:11:22.670
I give so much of my time, energy, love, attention, affection, all these things.

190
00:11:22.670 --> 00:11:26.060
But I don't get anything in return. Right?

191
00:11:26.060 --> 00:11:28.960
That's what it means to not get anything back or I don't get nothing back.

192
00:11:29.570 --> 00:11:31.630
Like I said before the word "back", you can think of return.

193
00:11:31.630 --> 00:11:38.030
So in this case, I'm giving so much in the relationship and I feel like I don't receive anything in return. All right?

194
00:11:38.030 --> 00:11:42.620
In the next line, she says, "I really thought it was love, but you're so fucking whack".

195
00:11:43.430 --> 00:11:44.890
Now that one's kind of self-explanatory.

196
00:11:44.890 --> 00:11:47.370
But what I want to explain here is the words "fucking" and "whack".

197
00:11:47.830 --> 00:11:51.880
Because I'm sure you've heard on the podcast before me explain the fact that

198
00:11:51.880 --> 00:11:56.440
The word "fucking" many times it's used to put emphasis on the word that comes after it.

199
00:11:57.220 --> 00:12:00.380
And in this case, that word is whack, W H A C K.

200
00:12:00.860 --> 00:12:03.460
And whack is just like, the opposite of cool. The opposite of good.

201
00:12:03.830 --> 00:12:05.480
The opposite of quality. All right?

202
00:12:05.480 --> 00:12:09.700
So I thought this relationship was the one. I thought this was love. I thought this was real.

203
00:12:10.230 --> 00:12:13.410
But I ended up finding out that you're just fucking whack.

204
00:12:13.410 --> 00:12:15.990
You're lame. You're not cool. You're not the one for me.

205
00:12:16.490 --> 00:12:21.010
You're not as good as I thought you were in the beginning. Right?

206
00:12:22.050 --> 00:12:26.330
So she continues and says, "Always get caught up in love. But I am done with that".

207
00:12:26.820 --> 00:12:28.470
So here I just want to explain "caught up".

208
00:12:29.630 --> 00:12:36.760
To get caught up in something means to become involuntary involved in something, especially emotionally. Right?

209
00:12:36.760 --> 00:12:42.980
So I'm always getting involuntarily involved in love and relationships and things like that, but now I'm done with that.

210
00:12:44.180 --> 00:12:48.000
So the next line, she says, "I can't get caught up in love, so now..." Yeah.

211
00:12:48.990 --> 00:12:51.620
So the next line after that, I want to explain, she says,

212
00:12:51.620 --> 00:12:53.990
"Flexing on my exes in my Model X"

213
00:12:54.160 --> 00:12:57.020
"Pretty little skinny, little bitty body model-esque".

214
00:12:57.390 --> 00:12:59.810
That's two lines. So the first one, flexing.

215
00:13:01.220 --> 00:13:02.830
This one is kind of hard to explain.

216
00:13:03.310 --> 00:13:06.210
To be flexing is like, showing off.

217
00:13:07.090 --> 00:13:10.730
Showing everybody how good you look or how much you have or how happy you are or whatever it is.

218
00:13:10.730 --> 00:13:11.440
It's just showing off.

219
00:13:11.720 --> 00:13:14.940
So if I'm flexing on my ex... and just in case you don't know,

220
00:13:14.940 --> 00:13:20.130
"my ex" is a shorter way of saying my ex-girlfriend or my ex-boyfriend, my ex-partner.

221
00:13:20.590 --> 00:13:24.200
So whenever you hear somebody say "my ex", that's what they're talking about.

222
00:13:24.560 --> 00:13:31.280
So if I'm flexing on my ex, it's like we just broke up and I'm showing her like, I'm happy without you.

223
00:13:31.630 --> 00:13:35.970
I'm getting money. I got, you know, a nice car,

224
00:13:35.970 --> 00:13:39.830
Which is again or not again, it's not what I meant to say.

225
00:13:40.630 --> 00:13:44.330
Model X, which is the rest of the line, she says, "Flexing all my exes in my Model X".

226
00:13:44.720 --> 00:13:48.990
A Model X is a car. I believe is the Tesla. The Tesla Model X.

227
00:13:48.990 --> 00:13:52.720
So she's saying, like, I just broke up with my boyfriend and now I'm flexing on him.

228
00:13:54.120 --> 00:13:56.460
It's like, yeah, we broke up, whatever, but I'm still doing good.

229
00:13:56.460 --> 00:14:01.000
Like, I got a brand new car, great career. I'm happy, fulfilled.

230
00:14:01.070 --> 00:14:04.450
Like, I'm fine without you. You know what I'm saying?

231
00:14:04.450 --> 00:14:06.410
She's flexing on him, just showing off.

232
00:14:07.410 --> 00:14:10.710
And then the next line, "Pretty little skinny, little bitty body model-esque".

233
00:14:12.380 --> 00:14:17.380
This one's kind of hard because it's like a very... it's a poetic, like, artistic way of speaking.

234
00:14:17.380 --> 00:14:21.520
So "pretty little skinny, little bitty", it's kind of hard to explain like,

235
00:14:21.520 --> 00:14:23.090
Why that makes sense or why she said that.

236
00:14:23.700 --> 00:14:27.940
But you understand the word pretty most likely you understand the word little and skinny.

237
00:14:28.650 --> 00:14:32.300
And she's referring to herself because if you see a picture of her, she's a very skinny woman.

238
00:14:32.300 --> 00:14:36.600
So she says, pretty little skinny, little bitty.

239
00:14:38.130 --> 00:14:43.330
The word "bitty" B I T T Y, is not something that's like, that we say on a day to day basis,

240
00:14:43.380 --> 00:14:47.910
But it's a creative way of saying the word "bitch".

241
00:14:48.700 --> 00:14:51.390
You're saying bitch without saying bitch. You know what I mean?

242
00:14:52.760 --> 00:14:54.170
It's really hard to explain that, but..

243
00:14:54.660 --> 00:14:58.940
Pretty little skinny little, and she's just like describing herself in an artistic way.

244
00:14:59.060 --> 00:15:00.730
She's this pretty little skinny woman.

245
00:15:01.880 --> 00:15:05.270
But she says "bitty", which in my mind when I hear bitty, I think bitch.

246
00:15:05.270 --> 00:15:06.510
She's just not saying the word bitch.

247
00:15:06.510 --> 00:15:10.160
It's a less vulgar, more colorful, or creative way of saying that.

248
00:15:10.310 --> 00:15:13.010
So she's saying, I'm a pretty little skinny little woman.

249
00:15:13.010 --> 00:15:15.350
And then she says, "body model-esque".

250
00:15:15.710 --> 00:15:18.810
And model-esque means similar to that of a model.

251
00:15:19.710 --> 00:15:24.050
So she's talking about herself saying, a pretty woman, a skinny woman, a little woman,

252
00:15:24.730 --> 00:15:28.540
And her body is like that of a model. She's gorgeous. Right?

253
00:15:29.240 --> 00:15:31.620
So I'm flexing on my exes in my Model X.

254
00:15:31.620 --> 00:15:34.500
Pretty little skinny, little bitty body model-esque.

255
00:15:35.320 --> 00:15:37.440
You see what I'm saying? All right.

256
00:15:37.630 --> 00:15:41.500
So next line, "Some of y'all ain't never had no real bitch and it shows"

257
00:15:41.980 --> 00:15:44.620
"I keep it one hundred from my head down to my toes"

258
00:15:45.230 --> 00:15:46.730
I said next line. But that was two lines.

259
00:15:46.780 --> 00:15:50.470
So the first one, some of y'all ain't never had no real bitch and it shows.

260
00:15:51.940 --> 00:15:55.800
Now, she said "ain't never had no", and again, this is Ebonics.

261
00:15:56.290 --> 00:16:00.010
A typical English teacher would tell you this is grammatically incorrect, never say something like this.

262
00:16:00.010 --> 00:16:02.230
And I'm also not telling you to speak like this.

263
00:16:02.230 --> 00:16:06.800
I just want you to understand that it's not incorrect, it's just a different dialect.

264
00:16:06.800 --> 00:16:11.500
So when she says "ain't never had no", that's a double negative. Right?

265
00:16:11.880 --> 00:16:13.700
Because "ain't" is a negative word.

266
00:16:14.370 --> 00:16:20.750
And it means many things, but in this context, in this sentence, it means we're using it... how can I say?

267
00:16:22.380 --> 00:16:24.520
In the present, we're using it like the present perfect tense.

268
00:16:24.570 --> 00:16:28.650
So I could say "some of y'all have never had a real bitch and it shows".

269
00:16:29.260 --> 00:16:31.720
And that's the present perfect in standard English that makes perfect sense.

270
00:16:31.780 --> 00:16:34.680
But in Ebonics, I would say "some of y'all ain't never had".

271
00:16:34.680 --> 00:16:39.050
And it's literally the same thing, the same meaning and everything.

272
00:16:39.050 --> 00:16:40.960
It's just a different choice of words.

273
00:16:41.490 --> 00:16:45.210
So some of you all have never had a real bitch, and it shows.

274
00:16:45.210 --> 00:16:48.810
Now a real bitch it's really hard to explain the way we use the word "bitch"

275
00:16:48.810 --> 00:16:51.320
Because there's so many meanings and uses, right?

276
00:16:51.320 --> 00:16:52.490
It just depends on the context.

277
00:16:52.490 --> 00:16:57.170
So in this context, a real bitch, which is just like a real nigga,

278
00:16:57.170 --> 00:16:59.280
But we use the word bitch for women and nigga for men.

279
00:17:00.080 --> 00:17:09.340
I say we and I mean like, people of my culture, not all black people and not all white people. Not all Americans.

280
00:17:09.340 --> 00:17:14.400
It's hard to explain because it's, I want to say, black people and black culture, but that doesn't apply to all black people.

281
00:17:14.500 --> 00:17:15.820
I can't really generalize like that.

282
00:17:15.820 --> 00:17:19.970
So I'm going to say people like me, whatever that means.

283
00:17:19.970 --> 00:17:24.590
I'm going to have to think about that and find a way to explain that in the future. All right?

284
00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:27.950
But for the sake of this episode, I'm going to continue.

285
00:17:27.950 --> 00:17:36.210
So a real bitch is essentially a real woman, a real person. An authentic, genuine person.

286
00:17:36.210 --> 00:17:41.620
Never fake, never manipulative or deceitful or nothing like that.

287
00:17:41.620 --> 00:17:43.980
A real bitch is somebody that's authentic.

288
00:17:45.990 --> 00:17:48.790
And I mean, you understand the word "real". Just the opposite of fake.

289
00:17:49.170 --> 00:17:51.220
So she's saying, "some of y'all have never had a real woman".

290
00:17:51.450 --> 00:17:54.600
Some of y'all never had somebody real, and it shows.

291
00:17:54.890 --> 00:18:00.250
So when she says "it shows" like, all she's saying is it's apparent, I can see it. You know what I'm saying?

292
00:18:00.250 --> 00:18:05.520
Some of y'all have never had a real woman. Some of y'all have never had real love, a real partner.

293
00:18:05.640 --> 00:18:09.360
And I can see that. It shows in your behavior, the way you talk, the way you carry yourself.

294
00:18:09.700 --> 00:18:15.730
You ain't never had a real woman. You've been playing around with these little girls. You know what I'm saying?

295
00:18:16.130 --> 00:18:18.840
And it's very apparent in the way you carry yourself or the way you behave.

296
00:18:19.180 --> 00:18:22.710
That's the idea, or at least that's what I understood from the sentence. You know?

297
00:18:23.480 --> 00:18:26.220
So then she says, "I keep it one hundred from my head down to my toes".

298
00:18:26.480 --> 00:18:28.740
Which is a continuation of the idea because she's saying,

299
00:18:28.780 --> 00:18:32.500
Some of y'all have never had a real one, and that's another way you can say it.

300
00:18:32.500 --> 00:18:34.350
You don't have to say "real nigga" or "real bitch".

301
00:18:34.550 --> 00:18:38.060
Something that's universal is a "real one". We say that all the time.

302
00:18:38.060 --> 00:18:40.390
That dude is a real one. She's a real one. He's a real one.

303
00:18:40.390 --> 00:18:43.980
It just means that he's real. He's authentic. He's not fake. You know what I'm saying?

304
00:18:44.700 --> 00:18:48.870
So some of y'all have never had a real one. And that's apparent, it shows.

305
00:18:49.300 --> 00:18:51.780
But I keep it one hundred from my head down to my toes.

306
00:18:51.780 --> 00:18:55.790
Now, if you listen to every episode of the podcast, you should know what to keep it one hundred means.

307
00:18:56.290 --> 00:19:01.070
But she's saying, I keep it one hundred, which means I'm always real, 100% authentic.

308
00:19:01.620 --> 00:19:07.050
From my head down to my toes, which is just a creative way of saying 100%. Right?

309
00:19:07.050 --> 00:19:09.650
From the top of my head to the bottom of my toes, my entire body,

310
00:19:09.650 --> 00:19:11.550
Everything about me is real, inside and out.

311
00:19:12.280 --> 00:19:14.660
I keep it one hundred from my head to my toes. You know what I'm saying?

312
00:19:16.340 --> 00:19:20.360
All right. So then she says, "Back up on my bullshit. Back up on the move".

313
00:19:21.070 --> 00:19:22.900
Now you should understand back up on my bullshit.

314
00:19:22.930 --> 00:19:26.750
But to be back up on the move or to be on the move just means like...

315
00:19:28.390 --> 00:19:33.150
It's kind of hard to explain, it just means mobile, not literally moving, but it just means...

316
00:19:35.240 --> 00:19:40.600
Hold on, let me do a quick internet search to see if I can find a good definition for you.

317
00:19:40.600 --> 00:19:48.240
To be on the move. To be on the move, to be traveling from one place to another or to be busy and active.

318
00:19:48.240 --> 00:19:51.190
Yeah, I would say in this case, it's more like to be busy and active.

319
00:19:51.190 --> 00:19:54.210
I'm not sitting at home doing nothing waiting on you to call me anymore.

320
00:19:54.210 --> 00:19:58.490
I'm back up on the move. I'm getting around, I'm active, I'm doing things, enjoying my life.

321
00:19:58.860 --> 00:20:00.680
I'm good without you. You know what I'm saying?

322
00:20:00.680 --> 00:20:03.410
Because I'm back up on my bullshit. You feel me?

323
00:20:04.050 --> 00:20:06.160
So I'm back up on my bullshit. Back up on the move.

324
00:20:06.540 --> 00:20:09.130
Touch down in my hometown, got nothing to lose.

325
00:20:10.280 --> 00:20:19.870
So to touch down... to touch down is a colloquial way of saying to arrive via plane or to arrive by airplane.

326
00:20:20.840 --> 00:20:24.230
Because, you know, a plane takes off and then it flies to the sky

327
00:20:24.300 --> 00:20:29.170
And then eventually it lands back on the Earth and the wheels touch the ground.

328
00:20:29.170 --> 00:20:33.320
So it's kind of, it's hard to explain phrasal verbs, but it just means to arrive by plane.

329
00:20:34.130 --> 00:20:37.410
If I touched down in my city, it means I just came here from another city,

330
00:20:37.410 --> 00:20:39.670
Most likely via plane, and I just arrived.

331
00:20:40.030 --> 00:20:45.060
So if I touch down in my hometown, it means I'm back in my home city, the place where I grew up, my home.

332
00:20:46.070 --> 00:20:47.480
And she said "I got nothing to lose".

333
00:20:48.280 --> 00:20:52.480
So it's kind of just remember the idea of the song is like, I just broke up with my ex,

334
00:20:53.270 --> 00:20:58.160
And now I'm back to my old ways when I was single. You see what I'm saying?

335
00:20:58.160 --> 00:21:00.500
And now I'm back in my hometown. I got nothing to lose.

336
00:21:00.500 --> 00:21:03.220
I got no relationships, no responsibilities, no obligations.

337
00:21:03.220 --> 00:21:06.690
Like, I'm on my bullshit. Let's get it cracking. You know what I'm saying?

338
00:21:07.510 --> 00:21:09.750
So, touch down in my hometown, got nothing to lose.

339
00:21:10.240 --> 00:21:11.470
I am on my own now.

340
00:21:12.120 --> 00:21:13.140
I am in control now.

341
00:21:13.660 --> 00:21:14.670
I need you to go now.

342
00:21:15.130 --> 00:21:16.480
I can fix my own crown.

343
00:21:17.270 --> 00:21:20.400
So these last two lines, she says, "I am on my own now".

344
00:21:20.510 --> 00:21:25.120
And to be on your own just means to be by yourself, to be responsible for taking care of yourself.

345
00:21:25.120 --> 00:21:29.050
You don't have any support or anybody helping you. You know what I'm saying?

346
00:21:29.720 --> 00:21:30.890
That's what it means to be on your own.

347
00:21:30.890 --> 00:21:35.220
And then she says, "I'm in control. I need you to go and I can fix my own crown".

348
00:21:35.290 --> 00:21:36.310
So just in case you don't know,

349
00:21:36.310 --> 00:21:43.050
A crown, it's not a hat, but it's that headpiece that a king or a queen wears. Made of gold most of the time.

350
00:21:43.050 --> 00:21:45.280
It's got the jewels in there and everything that shows them,

351
00:21:45.820 --> 00:21:48.450
Or that shows you that they're royalty and all that shit. That's a crown.

352
00:21:49.170 --> 00:21:52.360
So she's... I can't say this is what she's doing,

353
00:21:52.360 --> 00:21:56.900
But what I understand is that she's implying the fact that she's a queen. Right?

354
00:21:57.310 --> 00:21:59.820
If you're wearing a crown, you're either king or queen.

355
00:22:00.410 --> 00:22:06.510
So, yeah. That's all I want to explain there, just in case you didn't know what a crown was.

356
00:22:06.940 --> 00:22:08.520
Now that's verse one. Okay?

357
00:22:08.520 --> 00:22:10.610
So I'm just going to... actually,

358
00:22:10.650 --> 00:22:13.000
Let me try to play it for you now that I've explained all of it,

359
00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:14.770
Hopefully in a way that you can understand.

360
00:22:14.820 --> 00:22:18.870
I'm going to try to play that verse specifically and then we'll move on. All right?

361
00:22:21.240 --> 00:22:22.460
So I'm back

362
00:22:23.720 --> 00:22:27.030
It seem like I give so much and don't get nothin' back

363
00:22:27.270 --> 00:22:30.580
I really thought it was love but you're so fuckin' whack

364
00:22:30.800 --> 00:22:34.090
Always get caught up in love, but I am done with that

365
00:22:34.320 --> 00:22:37.460
I can't get caught up in lust, so now I'm, yeah

366
00:22:38.460 --> 00:22:41.070
Flexin' on my exes in my model X

367
00:22:41.070 --> 00:22:44.620
Pretty little skinny, little bitty body model-esque

368
00:22:44.650 --> 00:22:47.780
Some of y'all ain't never had no real bitch and it shows

369
00:22:48.240 --> 00:22:51.340
I keep it one hunnid from my head down to my toes

370
00:22:51.650 --> 00:22:53.220
Back up on my bullshit

371
00:22:53.430 --> 00:22:54.820
Back up on the move

372
00:22:55.140 --> 00:22:58.530
Touch down in my hometown, got nothing to lose

373
00:22:58.530 --> 00:23:01.750
I am on my own now, I am in control now

374
00:23:02.430 --> 00:23:05.360
I need you to go now, I can fix my own crown

375
00:23:05.770 --> 00:23:07.660
Back up on my bullshit

376
00:23:07.660 --> 00:23:10.790
All right.

377
00:23:11.040 --> 00:23:15.570
So hopefully now you can understand much better everything that was said in the first verse.

378
00:23:16.220 --> 00:23:18.810
And then after that verse, we go back to the chorus,

379
00:23:18.810 --> 00:23:22.280
Which like I said, is the main idea that gets repeated sometimes during the song.

380
00:23:22.850 --> 00:23:24.190
Back up on my bullshit.

381
00:23:24.190 --> 00:23:25.320
Backup on the scene.

382
00:23:25.510 --> 00:23:27.800
Done dealing with you. Don't know how to deal with me.

383
00:23:28.430 --> 00:23:30.750
Done fucking with you. Don't know how to love me.

384
00:23:31.230 --> 00:23:33.120
Done dealing with you. So I'm back.

385
00:23:33.590 --> 00:23:34.210
That's the chorus.

386
00:23:34.890 --> 00:23:37.760
Then we go to verse two, which is sung by H.E.R.

387
00:23:38.360 --> 00:23:43.010
So she says, "Seen you with your ex, I see you still about your old ways".

388
00:23:43.760 --> 00:23:45.070
There's a couple of things I want to explain here.

389
00:23:45.120 --> 00:23:49.880
The first one is how she starts the sentence. She says, "seen you with your ex".

390
00:23:50.480 --> 00:23:55.640
Now, when we're speaking Ebonics, it's very, very common to say something like this.

391
00:23:55.950 --> 00:23:56.800
Seen you with your ex.

392
00:23:56.800 --> 00:24:02.930
When really in standard English, you would say, I saw you with your ex or I have seen you with your ex.

393
00:24:04.090 --> 00:24:11.700
But in Ebonics a lot of times we conjugate verbs in the past tense differently than we might in standard English.

394
00:24:12.080 --> 00:24:14.810
So really, what she's saying is "I saw you with your ex" the standard.

395
00:24:15.240 --> 00:24:18.740
But in Ebonics, I would say "I seen you with your ex".

396
00:24:19.650 --> 00:24:22.480
And like I said, an English teacher would tell you that's grammatically incorrect.

397
00:24:23.210 --> 00:24:28.150
But in our dialect of English, it's normal to us to speak that way, standard to us.

398
00:24:28.660 --> 00:24:33.940
So again, "seen you with your ex" is the same thing as saying, "I saw you with your ex".

399
00:24:33.940 --> 00:24:39.080
And you notice I didn't even use the word I, or excuse me, she didn't use the word I in the sentence.

400
00:24:39.080 --> 00:24:43.630
She just said, "seen you with your ex", it's implicit that she's saying, I saw you with your ex.

401
00:24:44.140 --> 00:24:44.980
Hopefully, that makes sense.

402
00:24:45.810 --> 00:24:50.370
So then she says, "I see you still about your old ways". So there's two things here.

403
00:24:51.280 --> 00:24:54.110
The first one is, I see you still about your old ways.

404
00:24:54.110 --> 00:25:01.000
When in standard English you say, I see you're still about your old ways or I see you are still about your old ways.

405
00:25:01.050 --> 00:25:06.780
But again in Ebonics, there's many things, many small little changes that we make to our grammar

406
00:25:06.780 --> 00:25:12.680
Or to our pronunciation that are standard to us, but not correct in standard English.

407
00:25:14.130 --> 00:25:17.180
So it's totally normal for me to say something like, "I see you still about your old ways",

408
00:25:17.180 --> 00:25:23.820
When my textbook or my English teacher tells me I should say, "I see you still are about your old ways".

409
00:25:23.840 --> 00:25:28.120
Or "You are still", excuse me. You are still about your old ways. All right.

410
00:25:28.120 --> 00:25:34.980
So it's just a little grammar detail I wanted to bring to your attention because I know... really probably all of you, but if not,

411
00:25:34.980 --> 00:25:39.660
Most of you need to learn standard English for work or for travels or for whatever it is.

412
00:25:39.690 --> 00:25:45.100
But I just want you to understand what's being said when you hear this dialect of English, which is Ebonics.

413
00:25:45.100 --> 00:25:49.100
That's what I prefer to call it, but most of you probably know it as Black English. All right?

414
00:25:49.610 --> 00:25:52.800
So at the end of the phrase she says, "about your old ways".

415
00:25:53.480 --> 00:25:55.340
Now, this isn't something that we say all the time,

416
00:25:55.340 --> 00:26:05.140
But to be about your old ways is basically saying like, you're still doing the same old stuff.

417
00:26:05.600 --> 00:26:09.430
Your behavior, your thought process, your character, your philosophy has not changed.

418
00:26:09.760 --> 00:26:13.870
You're still doing the same old shit that you've always been doing. You see what I'm saying?

419
00:26:14.220 --> 00:26:18.660
I seen you with your ex. So I can see that you're still about your old ways.

420
00:26:18.710 --> 00:26:21.340
I saw you with your ex-girlfriend so I could see, you know,

421
00:26:21.340 --> 00:26:26.180
You still have the same mindset that you did before we started dating or while we were dating.

422
00:26:26.230 --> 00:26:28.000
I see nothing has changed. You haven't grown.

423
00:26:28.330 --> 00:26:31.500
You've gone back to what's familiar. You're going back to your ex-girlfriend.

424
00:26:31.500 --> 00:26:33.770
I see you still about your old ways. You know what I'm saying?

425
00:26:33.770 --> 00:26:35.610
I see nothing's changed. You feel me?

426
00:26:36.490 --> 00:26:38.640
So that's what I understood from that line.

427
00:26:39.260 --> 00:26:43.780
So after that, she says, "Might just see him for the weekend. You say that's a cold play".

428
00:26:44.410 --> 00:26:50.510
Now again, you've got to remember in both verses, these women are singing as if they're talking to their ex.

429
00:26:50.870 --> 00:26:55.930
So, she says, "might just see him for the weekend". She's referring to another guy. Right?

430
00:26:56.130 --> 00:26:57.610
I might just see this guy for the weekend.

431
00:26:57.850 --> 00:27:01.900
Now when she says, "You say that's a cold play" I don't know exactly what she means.

432
00:27:01.900 --> 00:27:05.380
I have a few ideas, but I don't know exactly what she means.

433
00:27:06.490 --> 00:27:09.700
So I prefer not to explain that one, because I don't want to confuse you.

434
00:27:10.170 --> 00:27:16.700
And I don't really know, so I can't tell you what I know because I don't know. You know what I'm saying?

435
00:27:16.700 --> 00:27:20.330
But "cold" I can tell you what the word cold means in our culture.

436
00:27:20.500 --> 00:27:25.700
Really, in English in general, sometimes if something is cold, it means it's like ruthless.

437
00:27:26.910 --> 00:27:31.960
There's no compassion, there's no empathy, there's no affection or nothing like that.

438
00:27:32.490 --> 00:27:37.920
It's cold. It's hard. It's harsh. Heartless. You know what I'm saying?

439
00:27:38.110 --> 00:27:39.490
Heartless is probably a good word.

440
00:27:40.310 --> 00:27:43.800
So when she says "You said that's a cold play" maybe,

441
00:27:44.210 --> 00:27:47.180
And I said I wasn't going to try to give you my ideas or theories,

442
00:27:47.230 --> 00:27:52.600
But maybe she's saying when I tell you that I might just see this other dude for the weekend,

443
00:27:52.600 --> 00:27:55.380
You say that's cold. Like, that's heartless. That's fucked up.

444
00:27:55.380 --> 00:27:58.770
We just broke up and you're going to go fuck with some other guy or something like that.

445
00:27:58.810 --> 00:28:01.310
I don't know if that's what she meant. I don't know.

446
00:28:02.150 --> 00:28:06.470
But we'll leave it at that man, and move on to the next line or the next two lines.

447
00:28:07.290 --> 00:28:11.240
She says "I be feeling triggered. I don't know how to let it go"

448
00:28:11.750 --> 00:28:14.740
"Really, you ain't shit and I know I'm too emotional".

449
00:28:15.180 --> 00:28:17.810
So the first line "I be feeling triggered".

450
00:28:18.990 --> 00:28:23.450
So I be feeling, again this is Ebonics, it's a different dialect to English,

451
00:28:23.450 --> 00:28:26.020
And it's totally standard to us to say "I be feeling".

452
00:28:26.750 --> 00:28:29.810
In standard English it makes... it's not that it doesn't make any sense,

453
00:28:29.810 --> 00:28:32.070
But it's just so, so, so incorrect.

454
00:28:32.150 --> 00:28:33.380
I be feeling triggered.

455
00:28:33.900 --> 00:28:40.380
But in English or excuse me, in Ebonics, it's like a different verb tense that doesn't exist in standard English.

456
00:28:40.420 --> 00:28:46.440
Because when I say I be feeling, I'm not saying that I feel in this moment, I'm not saying I am feeling.

457
00:28:46.760 --> 00:28:54.740
If I say I be feeling, I'm talking about something that happens continually or on a regular basis. You know what I'm saying?

458
00:28:54.840 --> 00:29:02.550
I be feeling triggered, it means I have the habit of feeling triggered or very often I feel triggered.

459
00:29:03.070 --> 00:29:03.590
You see what I'm saying?

460
00:29:03.590 --> 00:29:05.330
We're talking about something that happens very often.

461
00:29:05.330 --> 00:29:10.720
So for example, I be playing soccer like, every day.

462
00:29:10.720 --> 00:29:13.080
Or I be listening to the same songs every day.

463
00:29:13.080 --> 00:29:17.160
Which means I have the habit of playing soccer every day or listening to the same songs every day.

464
00:29:17.160 --> 00:29:21.100
This is something that happens often. I have the habit of doing this thing. You know?

465
00:29:21.870 --> 00:29:27.870
So "triggered" is like... I'm going to have to do an internet search for that one, too.

466
00:29:27.870 --> 00:29:29.290
It's hard to explain the word triggered.

467
00:29:30.180 --> 00:29:36.580
Define triggered. A response caused by a particular action process or situation.

468
00:29:39.060 --> 00:29:41.580
Yeah, I guess so, but when somebody says I feel triggered,

469
00:29:42.050 --> 00:29:50.050
It's because somebody said or did something that invoked like, emotional response. You see what I'm saying?

470
00:29:50.400 --> 00:29:56.280
So if I'm talking to my girl and she says something offensive or hurtful

471
00:29:56.870 --> 00:30:01.030
Or something like she's making fun of my... perfect example,

472
00:30:01.310 --> 00:30:04.730
If she's making fun of my insecurities or something like that, I might feel triggered.

473
00:30:05.300 --> 00:30:09.970
Something mean or hurtful that she says might make me snap like, something inside me snaps.

474
00:30:10.480 --> 00:30:14.880
And now my entire mood has changed. I'm angry, I'm upset, sad, whatever.

475
00:30:15.360 --> 00:30:17.410
But I feel triggered. You know?

476
00:30:17.410 --> 00:30:20.970
It's like she flipped the switch or set me off. You see what I'm saying?

477
00:30:21.190 --> 00:30:22.100
Hopefully that makes sense.

478
00:30:22.580 --> 00:30:24.240
I'm sure you've heard the word "triggered" at some point.

479
00:30:24.850 --> 00:30:28.740
And it just means you've had some strong emotional,

480
00:30:29.270 --> 00:30:32.420
Most likely impulsive response to something that somebody said or did.

481
00:30:33.480 --> 00:30:36.010
It made you feel very emotional for some reason. You know what I'm saying?

482
00:30:36.940 --> 00:30:41.170
So I be feeling triggered. I don't know how to let it go. And you probably know this.

483
00:30:41.170 --> 00:30:43.920
But just in case you don't, to let something go, to let it go,

484
00:30:43.920 --> 00:30:48.830
It just means to stop caring about it as if it was in your possession, in your hand

485
00:30:48.830 --> 00:30:51.140
And when you drop it or throw it away, you have led it go.

486
00:30:51.140 --> 00:30:55.250
It's not... You're not carrying it anymore, figuratively. You know what I'm saying?

487
00:30:55.790 --> 00:30:59.020
So then she says, "Really, you ain't shit. And I know I'm too emotional".

488
00:31:00.530 --> 00:31:02.470
So when you say... It's two things here.

489
00:31:02.890 --> 00:31:06.220
You ain't shit, again this is Ebonics.

490
00:31:06.220 --> 00:31:08.690
Like, we don't use the word "ain't" in standard English.

491
00:31:08.710 --> 00:31:13.520
Because in standard English, I would say "you are not shit" or "you aren't shit".

492
00:31:13.740 --> 00:31:15.180
But in Ebonics I say, "you ain't shit".

493
00:31:15.770 --> 00:31:20.560
And what that means if somebody ain't shit, it just means that they're worthless.

494
00:31:21.990 --> 00:31:24.210
That's really what it means. They're worthless, they bring no value.

495
00:31:27.340 --> 00:31:28.650
I don't really know how else to explain it.

496
00:31:28.860 --> 00:31:30.930
They're just a piece of shit. There's nothing good about them.

497
00:31:31.840 --> 00:31:34.360
They're a waste of space and they're not valuable at all.

498
00:31:34.360 --> 00:31:35.400
That's what it means when you ain't shit.

499
00:31:35.400 --> 00:31:39.870
Now amongst friends, somebody that you know, if I say,

500
00:31:39.870 --> 00:31:40.720
"Bro, you ain't shit".

501
00:31:41.160 --> 00:31:45.820
I can say it jokingly. I'm not trying to insult you and say literally that you're fucking worthless.

502
00:31:45.820 --> 00:31:48.730
If I say it to a friend, I'm just... Like, We're fucking around. You know what I'm saying?

503
00:31:48.730 --> 00:31:50.000
Like, nigga, you ain't shit.

504
00:31:50.690 --> 00:31:53.540
It's kind of hard to explain what that even means when I'm joking with my friends.

505
00:31:53.540 --> 00:32:00.170
But you know, I'm sure this is universal among or across all cultures, like with your friends, at least with guys.

506
00:32:00.220 --> 00:32:06.210
I don't know. It's normal for us to like, insult each other and talk shit, and it's fun. You know what I mean?

507
00:32:06.210 --> 00:32:11.460
So if I say "you ain't shit, bro". I'm not really trying to hurt your feelings or insult you or nothing like that.

508
00:32:11.460 --> 00:32:16.270
But here in the song she definitely is. She's not funny. She's not joking around. She's not playing.

509
00:32:16.270 --> 00:32:18.900
When she says, "Really, you ain't shit", it means nigga, you're worthless.

510
00:32:19.980 --> 00:32:23.450
And I know I'm too emotional. That's the rest of the line. Okay?

511
00:32:23.450 --> 00:32:26.770
This is my first time trying to explain a song in this way,

512
00:32:26.770 --> 00:32:30.300
So hopefully you're still following along and it's easy to follow along.

513
00:32:31.630 --> 00:32:35.220
But please, if you get a chance, give me some feedback on this explanation style.

514
00:32:35.220 --> 00:32:38.730
Because I still haven't figured out the best way to explain song lyrics.

515
00:32:39.060 --> 00:32:43.150
Should I go line by line or verse by verse? Or should I play the line and then explain it?

516
00:32:43.240 --> 00:32:46.940
I don't fucking know. So please somebody let me know. But let's continue.

517
00:32:47.600 --> 00:32:49.650
So after that, after those two lines.

518
00:32:49.650 --> 00:32:51.970
I be feeling triggered. I don't know how to let it go.

519
00:32:52.100 --> 00:32:54.280
Really, you ain't shit and I know I'm too emotional.

520
00:32:55.260 --> 00:32:57.910
After that, she says, "Putting me through it"

521
00:32:58.440 --> 00:33:00.730
"He's the only thing that's been getting me through it".

522
00:33:01.730 --> 00:33:04.240
Now, again, in this case, I don't know exactly what she mean.

523
00:33:04.370 --> 00:33:10.170
But what I understood when she says "putting me through it" she's referring to her ex,

524
00:33:10.300 --> 00:33:12.620
I guess, but I do not know. Okay?

525
00:33:13.310 --> 00:33:19.110
Because to put somebody through something means to force somebody to experience a particular situation or feeling or whatever it is.

526
00:33:19.460 --> 00:33:24.760
So if her ex is putting her through it, what that means is her ex is making her life difficult.

527
00:33:25.700 --> 00:33:27.050
Most of the time, that's really what it means.

528
00:33:27.050 --> 00:33:30.660
If somebody is putting you through it or the situation is really putting you through it, man.

529
00:33:30.660 --> 00:33:34.340
It's like, they're making you go through or experience something difficult.

530
00:33:35.810 --> 00:33:40.410
So I can't think of a positive situation when somebody says, "man, she's really putting me through it".

531
00:33:40.410 --> 00:33:44.680
Typically that's a negative thing. Typically this person for whatever reason,

532
00:33:45.480 --> 00:33:48.790
In whatever way is making my life more difficult or challenging.

533
00:33:49.390 --> 00:33:50.480
So putting me through it.

534
00:33:50.950 --> 00:33:52.890
He's the only thing that's been getting me through it.

535
00:33:52.890 --> 00:33:54.830
Now, I believe she's referring to a different guy.

536
00:33:55.640 --> 00:34:04.090
This guy over here is the only thing that has been getting me through or helping me, let's see...

537
00:34:06.220 --> 00:34:10.470
Helping me maintain my sanity while you put me through this difficult situation.

538
00:34:10.470 --> 00:34:14.460
I really don't know. It makes sense in my head, I hope it makes sense to you.

539
00:34:14.920 --> 00:34:16.490
So let me say it in a different way.

540
00:34:17.770 --> 00:34:22.860
My ex-boyfriend is putting me through it. He's making my life difficult, man. This relationship is shit.

541
00:34:23.200 --> 00:34:29.860
This guy over here is the only thing that is helping me maintain my sanity, helping me survive the situation,

542
00:34:29.860 --> 00:34:36.080
Helping me get through this situation or overcome these difficulties or whatever it is. You know?

543
00:34:37.970 --> 00:34:39.100
Man, I hope that makes sense.

544
00:34:39.630 --> 00:34:40.390
All right. So Let's move on.

545
00:34:41.310 --> 00:34:45.160
Then she says, "He be coming through with it and I hope you cool with it"

546
00:34:45.890 --> 00:34:48.630
"I just met your roommate, put him on my to do list".

547
00:34:48.630 --> 00:34:51.780
Nigga... like, what a thing to say, man.

548
00:34:51.800 --> 00:34:55.990
So the first line, he be coming through with it. Again, this is Ebonics. Right?

549
00:34:55.990 --> 00:35:02.470
He be coming through, which means on a regular basis he comes through. That's the meaning. Right?

550
00:35:02.470 --> 00:35:06.170
In standard English that's incorrect. In Ebonics is totally correct.

551
00:35:06.890 --> 00:35:12.220
And to come through most of the time means to come to my house or to come to where I am.

552
00:35:12.550 --> 00:35:14.780
So you might be at the house and you call me and say,

553
00:35:14.780 --> 00:35:15.730
"Hey, man, what are you doing?"

554
00:35:16.580 --> 00:35:19.100
And I'm like, "Now I'm just chilling at the house watching TV".

555
00:35:19.970 --> 00:35:25.750
And you be like, "So you want to... I don't know, you want to smoke?" Right?

556
00:35:25.750 --> 00:35:29.400
"You wanna smoke some weed or get some drinks, play some video games, whatever"

557
00:35:29.500 --> 00:35:30.700
"You want to kick it? You want to hang out?"

558
00:35:31.380 --> 00:35:32.080
I'm like, "Yeah, sure".

559
00:35:32.650 --> 00:35:34.170
And then you say, "All right. Come through".

560
00:35:34.990 --> 00:35:37.410
And what that means is get in your car and come to my house.

561
00:35:38.040 --> 00:35:40.300
It's hard to explain why we say it that way to come through,

562
00:35:40.300 --> 00:35:43.480
But that's what it means. Come to where I am. You see what I'm saying?

563
00:35:44.250 --> 00:35:45.470
So he be coming through with it.

564
00:35:45.980 --> 00:35:50.560
Now what is it in this case? I mean, I'm sure we can imagine.

565
00:35:50.560 --> 00:35:52.680
It might be some dick. It might be some weed. We don't know.

566
00:35:52.710 --> 00:35:54.240
If he be coming through with it, he be...

567
00:35:54.830 --> 00:35:59.430
He has the habit or on a regular basis he comes to where she is and gives her something.

568
00:36:00.680 --> 00:36:03.480
And I'm going to let you imagine what it is because we don't know.

569
00:36:03.730 --> 00:36:06.430
She didn't say. We can only assume.

570
00:36:07.140 --> 00:36:10.290
So after that, she says "And I hope you're cool with it". Right?

571
00:36:10.290 --> 00:36:13.860
So he be coming through with it, and I hope you cool with it. Right?

572
00:36:13.860 --> 00:36:16.570
And when she says, I hope you cool with it,

573
00:36:16.570 --> 00:36:20.150
To be cool with something just means to be okay with something, to have no problems with it.

574
00:36:21.210 --> 00:36:25.860
And in standard English, you say, "I hope you are cool with it" or "I hope you're cool with it".

575
00:36:25.860 --> 00:36:28.650
But in Ebonics, we say, "I hope you cool with it".

576
00:36:29.100 --> 00:36:31.320
The verb to be just isn't there. You see what I'm saying?

577
00:36:32.090 --> 00:36:36.990
So he be coming through with something most likely the dick. And I hope you cool with that.

578
00:36:37.880 --> 00:36:44.050
She's talking to her ex. I hope you don't got no problems with that.

579
00:36:44.370 --> 00:36:47.980
So then she says, "I just met your roommate. Put him on my to do list".

580
00:36:47.980 --> 00:36:54.350
Like, bro... And I just in case you don't know, roommate is the person that you live with. Right?

581
00:36:54.350 --> 00:36:59.120
So you have a two-bedroom apartment and you're splitting the rent with this other person,

582
00:36:59.120 --> 00:37:01.310
That's your roommate. The person you live with.

583
00:37:02.510 --> 00:37:05.990
So I just met your roommate and I put him on my to do list.

584
00:37:05.990 --> 00:37:11.410
And my "to do list" is the list of things that I need to do.

585
00:37:11.470 --> 00:37:18.090
So I met your roommate and now he's on my to do list because.. And it's kind of like a play on words.

586
00:37:18.090 --> 00:37:20.840
It's an artistic way of speaking, right?

587
00:37:20.840 --> 00:37:27.340
Because to do somebody, it's not it's not a really common thing to say, but to do somebody is like to have sex with somebody.

588
00:37:28.330 --> 00:37:30.130
It can mean that it can also mean to kill somebody.

589
00:37:30.130 --> 00:37:32.400
But in this case, it can mean to have sex with somebody.

590
00:37:32.400 --> 00:37:36.030
But if I put this girl or this guy on my to do list, it's like, you know,

591
00:37:36.430 --> 00:37:40.590
That person's in my future, I'm trying to get with this person, whatever that means.

592
00:37:41.340 --> 00:37:45.540
It most likely means sex. It's almost definitely what it means in this context. Right?

593
00:37:45.600 --> 00:37:47.790
I just met your roommate and put him on my to do list.

594
00:37:47.790 --> 00:37:50.230
So I'm done with you, and he's next.

595
00:37:50.960 --> 00:37:53.810
That's really what she's saying. Fucking savage, bro.

596
00:37:54.690 --> 00:37:59.220
So then she says, "Doing me. Back up on some new shit, everything in between".

597
00:38:00.070 --> 00:38:04.760
Now, "doing me" what that means is just to be doing your thing,

598
00:38:04.760 --> 00:38:08.460
To be living your life on your terms, in your way. That's what it means.

599
00:38:08.460 --> 00:38:12.930
So if somebody says, "Nah. Do you, man. Do you" just means live your life the way you want.

600
00:38:12.930 --> 00:38:14.300
Do your thing. Do whatever you want.

601
00:38:14.300 --> 00:38:17.300
Don't worry about what everybody else thinks or what everybody else wants you to do.

602
00:38:17.920 --> 00:38:21.050
You do what you want. You live your life, man. Do you.

603
00:38:21.970 --> 00:38:27.260
So when she says, I'm doing me, she's living her life the way she wants, on her terms. You feel me?

604
00:38:27.260 --> 00:38:30.790
And then she says, "back up on some new shit, everything in between".

605
00:38:31.240 --> 00:38:34.380
Now I tried to explain what "back up on" means,

606
00:38:34.820 --> 00:38:38.650
So I have returned or in this case, not returned to some new shit.

607
00:38:38.650 --> 00:38:40.600
But if I'm back up on some new shit, it's like...

608
00:38:44.310 --> 00:38:47.180
That chapter of my life, which was our relationship, is now over.

609
00:38:47.180 --> 00:38:53.350
I'm on some new shit and new shit just means like a new way of behaving, a new situation, a new lifestyle.

610
00:38:53.540 --> 00:39:00.060
Like, I'm just done with my life the way it was when we were dating. That's old shit.

611
00:39:00.060 --> 00:39:02.960
Now I'm on some new shit. I'm back up on my bullshit.

612
00:39:03.830 --> 00:39:07.300
Now when she says everything in between, I don't really know exactly what she means.

613
00:39:07.300 --> 00:39:12.130
But the idea, everything in between...

614
00:39:14.350 --> 00:39:19.600
To be honest, I can't even really explain it because I don't know exactly what she means when she says everything in between.

615
00:39:20.520 --> 00:39:22.300
Like, I get the idea when I'm listening to the song,

616
00:39:22.300 --> 00:39:24.960
But I don't know exactly what she means, so I can't really explain that to you.

617
00:39:25.800 --> 00:39:30.270
But after that, she says, "I'm out here, I'm getting stupid" "I'm done being exclusive"

618
00:39:30.550 --> 00:39:33.190
"And you know the truth is that these niggas is useless".

619
00:39:34.090 --> 00:39:36.670
So I'm out here, I'm getting stupid.

620
00:39:36.900 --> 00:39:39.860
When I'm out here, it just means kind of like the same thing as on the scene.

621
00:39:40.400 --> 00:39:45.630
Out in the streets, out and about at parties, you know, just it's not physically out somewhere.

622
00:39:45.970 --> 00:39:48.600
It's just a figure of speech. Right?

623
00:39:48.650 --> 00:39:51.290
I'm out here, I'm getting stupid.

624
00:39:52.140 --> 00:39:59.920
And that kind of goes back to the idea of "my bullshit" because they know that this bullshit behavior is toxic. Right?

625
00:40:00.260 --> 00:40:02.460
That's what she means when she says, "I'm out here, I'm getting stupid".

626
00:40:03.020 --> 00:40:09.390
And you'll see later in the song in just a few lines that what I'm saying is correct,

627
00:40:09.490 --> 00:40:12.030
Because they're going to further emphasize that point. All right?

628
00:40:12.030 --> 00:40:12.730
So let's continue.

629
00:40:13.670 --> 00:40:14.980
I'm out here, I'm getting stupid.

630
00:40:14.980 --> 00:40:16.460
I'm done being exclusive.

631
00:40:16.890 --> 00:40:22.340
And to be exclusive means to be in a committed relationship with somebody and everyone knows about it.

632
00:40:22.660 --> 00:40:26.560
So this is my girl and I'm her boyfriend and everyone knows that we are exclusive.

633
00:40:27.350 --> 00:40:30.950
The whole world knows that we are a couple and we're committed to each other.

634
00:40:31.710 --> 00:40:34.780
So if I'm done being exclusive it means I'm done being committed to one person.

635
00:40:34.820 --> 00:40:37.420
I'm done being in a relationship. You see what I'm saying?

636
00:40:37.420 --> 00:40:38.000
That's all it means.

637
00:40:38.760 --> 00:40:42.000
And then she says, "you know the truth is that these niggas is useless".

638
00:40:42.920 --> 00:40:46.160
So I guess three things I want to explain here.

639
00:40:46.220 --> 00:40:47.670
First, she says, "these niggas".

640
00:40:48.580 --> 00:40:52.510
The word "niggas" man, it's complicated because it means a couple of different things,

641
00:40:52.510 --> 00:40:56.690
But in this case, this context, she just means these guys, just men in general.

642
00:40:57.470 --> 00:40:59.170
You know these niggas is useless.

643
00:41:00.150 --> 00:41:04.100
And since we're talking about niggas, third person in plural, we should say "these niggas are useless".

644
00:41:04.140 --> 00:41:09.830
But in Ebonics, like I said, we conjugate our verbs a lot of times the same way for all people.

645
00:41:10.860 --> 00:41:17.130
You is, sometimes I is, he is, she is, we is, they is. You see what I'm saying?

646
00:41:17.130 --> 00:41:17.880
Very, very common.

647
00:41:17.930 --> 00:41:20.440
So, you know the truth is that these niggas is useless.

648
00:41:20.810 --> 00:41:23.730
And useless, I'm sure you understand, but it just means it has no utility.

649
00:41:24.060 --> 00:41:26.960
It's worthless. There's nothing I can do with this. It brings no value.

650
00:41:28.330 --> 00:41:29.460
You get the idea. Right?

651
00:41:29.690 --> 00:41:32.080
So the truth is that these niggas is useless.

652
00:41:32.540 --> 00:41:35.620
I'm back up on my bullshit. All right?

653
00:41:35.810 --> 00:41:36.470
So that's verse two.

654
00:41:36.470 --> 00:41:41.040
Now, let me just play it one more time so you can hear from start to finish and hopefully you understand a little bit better.

655
00:41:44.400 --> 00:41:52.740
Seen you with your ex, I see you still about your old ways

656
00:41:52.830 --> 00:41:56.150
Might just see him for the weekend, you say that's a cold play

657
00:41:56.390 --> 00:41:59.640
I be feelin' triggered, I don't know how to let it go

658
00:41:59.950 --> 00:42:04.930
Really, you ain't shit and I know I'm too emotional, ay, ay

659
00:42:05.140 --> 00:42:06.710
Puttin' me through it

660
00:42:06.950 --> 00:42:10.480
He's the only thing that's been gettin' me through it

661
00:42:10.480 --> 00:42:12.090
He be comin' through with it

662
00:42:12.230 --> 00:42:13.910
And I hope you cool with it

663
00:42:14.050 --> 00:42:18.440
I just met your roommate, put him on my to-do list

664
00:42:18.880 --> 00:42:19.720
Doin' me

665
00:42:20.230 --> 00:42:23.330
Back up on some new shit, everything in between

666
00:42:23.440 --> 00:42:25.330
I'm out here, I'm gettin' stupid

667
00:42:25.330 --> 00:42:27.260
I'm done bein' exclusive and

668
00:42:27.540 --> 00:42:30.610
You know the truth is that these niggas is useless

669
00:42:30.610 --> 00:42:32.230
I'm back on my bullshit

670
00:42:32.230 --> 00:42:35.400
All right, my friend.

671
00:42:36.040 --> 00:42:39.460
That was verse two, and then they go into the chorus again.

672
00:42:39.530 --> 00:42:40.740
Really, it's kind of like the bridge.

673
00:42:41.200 --> 00:42:44.070
But they say, "Back up on my bullshit. Back up on the scene"

674
00:42:44.640 --> 00:42:46.840
"Out here acting foolish like I'm 17".

675
00:42:47.490 --> 00:42:51.440
And that's what I meant when I said in just a few lines, you would see what I was trying to say.

676
00:42:51.440 --> 00:42:55.500
Because in the second verse, she says, "I'm out here, I'm getting stupid".

677
00:42:56.810 --> 00:43:02.000
And then in this course, she's saying out here acting foolish like I'm 17, that's really the same thing. You know what I'm saying?

678
00:43:03.180 --> 00:43:08.150
And foolish is just like similar to stupid, not smart, not clever, not wise.

679
00:43:08.150 --> 00:43:13.500
A fool is the opposite of a genius, really, an intelligent person, an educated person.

680
00:43:13.820 --> 00:43:16.010
So if you're a fool, you're fucking stupid. Right?

681
00:43:17.160 --> 00:43:21.510
So I'm out here acting foolish. I'm acting stupid like I'm 17. Right?

682
00:43:21.510 --> 00:43:29.360
Because I mean, many of us as young people, you know, ages like 14, 15 to 18, those high school years.

683
00:43:29.650 --> 00:43:33.810
You know what I'm saying? When we're just trying to figure out what's really what and all this shit.

684
00:43:33.810 --> 00:43:39.830
We do a lot of dumb stuff, make a lot of bad decisions, and I think that's really what they're referring to.

685
00:43:39.830 --> 00:43:44.840
Because as adults, hopefully we carry ourselves much differently than we did at 16 or 17,

686
00:43:45.540 --> 00:43:50.230
Both romantically, sexually, professionally, all those things. Right? In relationships and everything.

687
00:43:50.230 --> 00:43:53.610
So she's saying, "I'm out here acting foolish. I'm back up on my bullshit"

688
00:43:54.020 --> 00:43:56.420
"I'm acting stupid, just like I did when I was 17".

689
00:43:57.670 --> 00:43:58.220
That's the idea.

690
00:43:58.220 --> 00:44:03.030
So then she says, "I just bought a new whip, don't need gasoline"

691
00:44:03.280 --> 00:44:05.840
"I just seen your new bitch, it boost my self-esteem".

692
00:44:05.840 --> 00:44:08.200
That shit is so cold. I love that line.

693
00:44:08.680 --> 00:44:10.250
So I just bought a new whip.

694
00:44:11.460 --> 00:44:14.120
Whip, W H I P is like slang for a car.

695
00:44:14.650 --> 00:44:17.960
So if I'm riding in my whip, I'm riding in my car, it's the same thing.

696
00:44:18.820 --> 00:44:20.210
And she said, "don't need gasoline".

697
00:44:20.440 --> 00:44:23.890
And she's talking about her Model X. The Tesla Model X doesn't need gas.

698
00:44:24.430 --> 00:44:27.140
So she's flexing. I just bought a new whip, don't need gasoline.

699
00:44:27.520 --> 00:44:30.200
I just seen your new bitch, it boost my self-esteem.

700
00:44:31.300 --> 00:44:33.470
So again, I just seen, that's Ebonics.

701
00:44:33.820 --> 00:44:39.300
I should have said or she in standard English would say, "I just saw your new bitch"

702
00:44:40.140 --> 00:44:42.390
Or "I have just seen your new bitch".

703
00:44:42.980 --> 00:44:45.010
But in Ebonics, we say "I just seen your new bitch".

704
00:44:45.010 --> 00:44:51.190
And many times in Ebonics we use the word bitch to refer to women and the word nigga to refer to men,

705
00:44:51.210 --> 00:44:55.780
Even though we're not necessarily calling them a nigga or a bitch in the literal sense.

706
00:44:56.870 --> 00:44:59.510
Kind of hard to explain why we do that. It's a very cultural thing.

707
00:45:00.100 --> 00:45:01.910
And to be honest, I don't know exactly why we do it.

708
00:45:01.990 --> 00:45:05.630
It's just.. I have an idea, but it's hard to explain cultures sometimes.

709
00:45:05.650 --> 00:45:08.020
So anyway, I just seen your new bitch.

710
00:45:08.020 --> 00:45:11.980
I just saw your new girl, your new girlfriend, your new main squeeze, your new whatever.

711
00:45:11.980 --> 00:45:14.580
Your new bitch. The new girl you're dealing with.

712
00:45:14.640 --> 00:45:17.270
I just saw her and it boost my self-esteem.

713
00:45:17.520 --> 00:45:23.820
So to boost, you can think of it like a huge increase, a very rapid and big increase.

714
00:45:24.510 --> 00:45:27.820
Like PUFF... like that. You can think of that when you hear "boost". Boost!

715
00:45:28.470 --> 00:45:32.210
Like a rocket or something like that, take off. You know what I'm saying?

716
00:45:32.590 --> 00:45:37.340
So if something boosts my self-esteem it radically increases my self-esteem.

717
00:45:38.450 --> 00:45:42.100
My self-esteem goes up. It increases rapidly and greatly. Right?

718
00:45:42.440 --> 00:45:45.550
So I just saw your new girl and it boost my self-esteem.

719
00:45:45.600 --> 00:45:48.760
And my self-esteem is just the way I feel about myself, the way I think about myself.

720
00:45:49.170 --> 00:45:50.640
How highly I regard myself.

721
00:45:51.040 --> 00:45:53.820
So after I saw your new girl like, God, damn, that's who you're with?

722
00:45:54.580 --> 00:45:57.940
That made me feel better about myself. You obviously haven't done better than me.

723
00:45:59.010 --> 00:46:01.740
That's the idea. You obviously can't find something better than me.

724
00:46:01.740 --> 00:46:04.150
If that's your new girl, if that's what you call an upgrade.

725
00:46:04.150 --> 00:46:07.560
Like, damn, I feel better about myself now.

726
00:46:08.240 --> 00:46:09.970
And that's how... she's basically saying like,

727
00:46:09.970 --> 00:46:12.430
Your new girl has nothing on me. She's not prettier than me.

728
00:46:12.430 --> 00:46:16.710
She can't give you more than I gave you. She can't do for you what I did for you. You know what I'm saying?

729
00:46:16.800 --> 00:46:19.170
You downgraded when you broke up with me nigga.

730
00:46:20.190 --> 00:46:22.650
Your bitch, your new bitch boost my self-esteem. You feel me?

731
00:46:23.600 --> 00:46:26.420
That's what she... that's what I understood from what she said. All right?

732
00:46:26.900 --> 00:46:29.480
And then the rest of the chorus is just the same as before.

733
00:46:29.480 --> 00:46:30.510
Back up on my bullshit.

734
00:46:30.510 --> 00:46:31.410
Back up on the scene.

735
00:46:31.410 --> 00:46:33.200
Done dealing with you. Don't know how to deal with me.

736
00:46:33.680 --> 00:46:35.520
Done fucking with you. Don't know how to love me.

737
00:46:35.520 --> 00:46:36.730
Done dealing with you. So I'm back.

738
00:46:36.730 --> 00:46:42.000
And then they end the song saying, "Flex on my ex in my model X". Right?

739
00:46:42.280 --> 00:46:45.750
They say that a bunch of times. And I explained that, right?

740
00:46:45.750 --> 00:46:47.580
To be flexing on my exes is like showing off,

741
00:46:47.580 --> 00:46:53.060
And showing my ex how much happier I am without her or him in this case, and that I'm doing fine. Right?

742
00:46:53.240 --> 00:46:59.440
I'm living a great life and you missing out because you broke up with me or I broke up with you or whatever. You fucked up.

743
00:46:59.880 --> 00:47:02.860
Now I'm flexing on you to show you how happy I am in my Model X,

744
00:47:03.490 --> 00:47:07.270
Don't need gasoline and your new bitch boost my self-esteem, nigga. You feel me?

745
00:47:08.190 --> 00:47:09.840
So that's the song. All right?

746
00:47:09.840 --> 00:47:12.040
I'm gonna play it one more time from start to finish.

747
00:47:12.680 --> 00:47:15.730
And like I said, please, if you've listened to the whole episode,

748
00:47:16.080 --> 00:47:18.860
Let me know on the Discord server or get in touch with me somehow.

749
00:47:18.860 --> 00:47:21.970
And let me know what you think about this style of explanation.

750
00:47:22.700 --> 00:47:26.150
Was it easy to follow everything I was saying? Am I talking too fast?

751
00:47:26.150 --> 00:47:28.350
Should I play line by line like I did in the past?

752
00:47:28.350 --> 00:47:30.570
Or do you prefer it this way? Let me know something.

753
00:47:31.220 --> 00:47:35.030
And also let me know if there's anything that you still don't understand about the song,

754
00:47:35.470 --> 00:47:40.400
The words in the song, the difference between standard English and Ebonics, whatever.

755
00:47:40.400 --> 00:47:49.000
Any questions or doubts you have, obviously you can get in touch with me on that Discord server or however you prefer to communicate.

756
00:47:49.270 --> 00:47:49.830
All right, my friend?

757
00:47:50.510 --> 00:47:52.740
But I'm going to play the song like I said one more time.

758
00:47:53.250 --> 00:48:00.800
And then we'll get out of here, man.

759
00:48:04.840 --> 00:48:10.670
So here we go.

760
00:48:10.950 --> 00:48:11.120
Yeah

761
00:48:11.400 --> 00:48:11.500
Yeah

762
00:48:11.870 --> 00:48:11.940
Ah

763
00:48:12.230 --> 00:48:18.300
Back up on my

764
00:48:19.130 --> 00:48:24.960
Done dealing with you

765
00:48:25.430 --> 00:48:25.770

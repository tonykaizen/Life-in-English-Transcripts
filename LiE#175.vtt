00:00:01.050 --> 00:00:06.390
Mic check, mic check, one, two. Can you hear me? Can you
hear me?

2
00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:07.930
Am I coming through the speakers?

3
00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:17.840
Ahh. Drinking on a nice cup of coffee, I just had lunch, my
friend. I hope you're doing well. This is the Life in English podcast.

4
00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:24.260
I am Tony Kaizen and I just wanted to put
one little bit of information on your brain today for you to

5
00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:33.350
think about. Recently, I've been making a real effort to
limit my screen time. That came out weird- limit my screen

6
00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:39.600
time. And just in case you don't know, screen time is the
amount of time you spend looking at a screen. So it's your

7
00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:47.280
cell phones, your computers, your TV, etc. And on my phone
and computer, I get a weekly report from this app called

8
00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:52.820
Screen Time and it tells me you spent an average of this
many hours per day looking at a screen and you spent an

9
00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:59.370
average of this much time looking at this website or on this
app, etc. And it got to the point where it was like

10
00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:09.990
thirteen, fifteen, sixteen hours a day sometimes and I'm
just like, "Yo, this, this is not sustainable." First of

11
00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:15.880
all, it's not healthy. And not only that, but large amounts
of time are being spent on shit that really isn't

12
00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:22.060
productive. I don't need to be looking at a screen during
large amounts of my day because I'm not actually getting

13
00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:28.690
something done. So I was like, "Man, this, I gotta, you
know, I wanna do this long term. I'm still relatively young

14
00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:35.080
and I got a lot of screen time left in me." So I want to
limit that shit because I need my eyes, bro. And it's about

15
00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:40.720
mental health, I'll get to that in a second but anyway, I'm
just talking about my reason for limiting my screen time. I

16
00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:48.590
wanna do it in a sustainable way. I wanna work from home or
online in a sustainable way. And taking care of my health is

17
00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:55.210
really important part of that, alright? So I've been trying
to limit the time. And not only that, I've been, you know,

18
00:01:55.210 --> 00:02:00.350
off and on trying to get back into the routine of meditating
a little bit. I try to do it when I wake up in the morning

19
00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:05.310
and then during a break period in the afternoon and also in
the evening where I just sit down and do nothing for like

20
00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:11.360
seven to ten minutes. It's a lot harder than it sounds, but
I've been trying to be disciplined to do it every day. Those

21
00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:17.640
two things just like limiting my screen time and, and
meditating one to three times a day has really, really

22
00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:23.980
helped, uh, my physical and mental health, you know? Cause
when we talk about screen time, I'm also talking about

23
00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:28.960
social media consumption, because for a lot of us, that's
what we're doing. We're not on our phones trying to get

24
00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:37.240
stuff done. We're on our phones like trying to escape
boredom or emptiness or whatever negative feelings and

25
00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:45.670
emotions we tend to feel, we can just pull out our phone and
ignore those feelings and be distracted by a bunch of random

26
00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:54.100
shit, you know? And I've noticed once I've stopped or since
I've stopped doing that compulsively and just choosing to

27
00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:59.030
only pull out my phone when I'm trying to get something done
or actually contact someone, only get on my computer when

28
00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:04.540
I'm trying to accomplish a task, like it's done a lot.

29
00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:11.050
It's like made a huge change --I shouldn't exaggerate-- I'm
starting to see significant changes in my ability to focus

30
00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:18.820
for long periods of time. My, uh, my emotional stability,
like my... the clarity of my thinking, you know what I mean,

31
00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:27.070
my productivity, everything just increases because I'm not
just constantly distracted by nonsense, you know what I

32
00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:32.910
mean? Even useful information like there's a time and place
for everything, right? And I don't need to just be consuming

33
00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:38.300
a bunch of information all the time. We have to put it to
work, we have to like, do shit. So at some point you got to

34
00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:45.170
stop consuming and start producing, you know what I mean?
And, um, since I focused more on, on that balance of like

35
00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:52.590
consuming less and producing more, be more productive, I've
seen like uh, a really positive impact on just my daily

36
00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:57.940
life, which allows me to be more productive, get more done,
I'm happier because I'm more productive and get more shit

37
00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:04.030
done and I'm more focused. And, uh, what I also noticed
driving down the street the other day is just like almost

38
00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:13.100
the entire day I hadn't touched my phone, only to answer
messages, uh, maybe upload a video or, or listen to some

39
00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:19.920
music or a podcast or something. But I wasn't really looking
at my phone pretty much the entire day. And it just, I don't

40
00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:26.840
know, I was driving down the street and it just dawned on
me. All of a sudden I was like, "Man, it's been a long time

41
00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:35.270
since I've actually been notified of what's happening
somewhere else in the world.", like talk to somebody who let

42
00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:40.050
me know what was going on in their part of the world or
watched a video on social media, seeing something happen

43
00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:45.600
somewhere else, like the entire day, it was just what was
happening here in the present moment, like where I was at

44
00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:47.510
the time. That was it.

45
00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:54.320
And it was like this weird moment where I realized how happy
I was because of that. It was just like bliss. And man, you

46
00:04:54.320 --> 00:05:01.530
know, it's almost like -- not as if there were no problems
in the world but-- in that moment there were no problems, I

47
00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:07.840
was just driving down the street and that's all that really
matters. I don't need to know what's happening all around

48
00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:14.350
the world all the time like I don't give a shit. I really
don't. And that's not to say that, "Oh, I want bad things to

49
00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:20.690
be happening to people and I want war to exist..." like
obviously, I'm not saying that. I'm just saying if I'm being

50
00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:27.540
honest with myself and I'm being honest with you, I don't
give a shit what's happening 3000 miles from here right now.

51
00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:33.160
I don't care. You know what I care about? This cup of coffee
in my hand and what I got to say to you, that's what I care

52
00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:39.450
about right now. That's all that's, uh, on my mind.

53
00:05:39.450 --> 00:05:44.850
That's all that matters. Because that's all I can control.
So that's all I need to focus on. Why would, I mean, why do

54
00:05:44.850 --> 00:05:53.340
I need to know? Why do I need to know? Or, you know, if I do
need to know, like set aside a particular time in my day for

55
00:05:53.340 --> 00:06:01.140
that, I'm gonna get on my phone, on my computer and consume
current events, media about current events so I can update

56
00:06:01.140 --> 00:06:09.130
myself and know what's going on in the world. But just all
day? All day? It's not healthy, bro.

57
00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:15.980
Think about it with any other mind-altering substance
because social media, the Internet that form, that form of

58
00:06:15.980 --> 00:06:23.450
consumption is a mind altering substance. We have to
consider it as such, or I think we should. And if you think

59
00:06:23.450 --> 00:06:33.030
about any other mind altering substance, whether it's
alcohol, marijuana, cocaine, take your pick, anything like

60
00:06:33.030 --> 00:06:41.580
that. Maybe not marijuana, that's a different category.
Let's use alcohol. Let's use alcohol. Imagine you like to

61
00:06:41.580 --> 00:06:47.000
drink on the weekends, you have a little bit of fun. You
might crack open a bottle of wine when the kids are asleep,

62
00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:55.910
go on some Netflix, you feel me? Snuggle up on the couch,
take a sip of the wine, right? Or you might like to party

63
00:06:55.910 --> 00:07:02.480
hard. We're getting fucked up, right? Shots of vodka and
fucking tequila. Shot, shot, shot. You like to drink. You

64
00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:10.760
like to get turnt up and have a good time and party,
whatever. You're not gonna do that all day, every day,

65
00:07:11.210 --> 00:07:17.700
right? Imagine if you took a shot of liquor when you woke
up, a shot of liquor before you left the house. A shot of

66
00:07:17.700 --> 00:07:22.570
liquor when you got off the train. A shot of liquor before
you enter work. A shot of liquor on your lunch break.

67
00:07:23.590 --> 00:07:29.050
Another shot on the train ride home. Another shot as soon as
you get home. Another shot while you're cooking dinner.

68
00:07:29.050 --> 00:07:36.130
Another shot while you're hanging out with the kids...
You're fucking alcoholic.

69
00:07:36.130 --> 00:07:42.560
You need help, bro. It is not healthy or normal to just be
getting fucked up like that all day, every day. It's not

70
00:07:42.560 --> 00:07:50.410
good. And eventually one shot won't be enough. Then you'll
need three shots, then six shots, then twelve shots just to

71
00:07:50.410 --> 00:07:57.230
reach that same level that you're accustomed to being at. We
know how addiction works. Think about that. But just one

72
00:07:57.230 --> 00:08:00.780
more video. Just one more tweet, right?

73
00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:08.900
Just one more post. All you got to do is swipe up, right?
One video is not enough, now you need six or seven. Now you

74
00:08:08.900 --> 00:08:16.620
need thirteen. Now you need fifty. Before you know it, three
and a half hours of your day were spent scrolling and you

75
00:08:16.620 --> 00:08:25.130
can't remember three of the videos you watched. Like, bro,
you got a problem. That's a problem. Because then you're

76
00:08:25.130 --> 00:08:31.100
going to turn around and say, "Fuck, man, where did the time
go? Goddamn, that's... what? It's what year? It's what day?

77
00:08:31.210 --> 00:08:40.920
It's what month? It's what time? Where the fuck did the time
go?" You just gave it all away, bro. So anyway, anyway,

78
00:08:41.840 --> 00:08:45.370
I guess I don't even know if I've arrived at a point. I'm
just trying to share something I've been thinking about

79
00:08:45.370 --> 00:08:53.130
lately that I really think we should all think about from
time to time, which is we don't need to just be constantly

80
00:08:53.130 --> 00:09:00.780
consuming information all the time, allowing ourselves to be
distracted, fucking choosing to distract ourselves from the

81
00:09:00.780 --> 00:09:07.400
present moment just because it's not exactly the way we
would like it to be. Like where? Your time is never coming

82
00:09:07.400 --> 00:09:15.350
back, bro. And this is coming from somebody who's wasted
years of his life on fucking nonsense. Years of his life.

83
00:09:16.760 --> 00:09:21.810
I'm sure you have too. We all have. And I'm just here to put
this on your brain one more time today. Like, stop and think

84
00:09:21.810 --> 00:09:30.530
about it just one more time. Bruh,can you really afford to
walk through life just constantly distracted by shit that

85
00:09:30.530 --> 00:09:36.290
doesn't even matter? Can you really afford to ignore the
shit that really needs attention in your life? Developing

86
00:09:36.290 --> 00:09:42.590
skills, making connections, learning how to communicate,
right? I could...I mean, there's a list of stuff you know

87
00:09:42.590 --> 00:09:46.190
you need to do bro. Just...just...

88
00:09:48.300 --> 00:09:54.990
Just think about it for 30 days, man. Just give it a try.
Meditate twice a day and only pull out your phone if you

89
00:09:54.990 --> 00:10:01.710
need to get something done. Only look at a screen if you're
trying to get something done. And I guarantee you will see

90
00:10:01.710 --> 00:10:07.950
how much fucking free time you have on your hands. I
guarantee it, bro. And then you can stop and ask yourself,

91
00:10:07.950 --> 00:10:14.570
"Well, damn, what should I do with all this fucking time?"
That'll be your new problem. "How do I occupy all this time

92
00:10:14.570 --> 00:10:22.950
now that I'm not wasting it?" And the good news is the
answer to that question is whatever the fuck you want, bro.

93
00:10:24.090 --> 00:10:30.980
Take your pick. But the point is, you got the time to do it
now that you're not distracted or running away from boredom,

94
00:10:32.410 --> 00:10:36.940
sadness, emptiness, yourself, whatever it may be, bro.

95
00:10:37.090 --> 00:10:44.940
I don't know. Whatever it may be. I'm just saying think
about it, bro for the next 30 days. Long day at work, you

96
00:10:44.940 --> 00:10:50.160
get home, kiss the kids, kiss the wife or your husband,
whatever. If you...If you live by yourself, get home, hug

97
00:10:50.160 --> 00:10:56.720
your cats, see your dogs, whatever you do, resist the urge
to pick up the phone. Resist the urge to turn on the screen

98
00:10:56.810 --> 00:11:06.780
and just, just think. What could you do to make better use
of your time, man? The world's changing fast, bro. And, uh,

99
00:11:09.290 --> 00:11:15.680
I don't know, man. You just stay in the same place doing the
same shit every day, at some point, I just gotta believe

100
00:11:15.680 --> 00:11:21.150
it's gonna come back to bite you. You know, it's gonna catch
up with you at some point. Anyway, this isn't a fucking

101
00:11:21.760 --> 00:11:27.330
intervention or some goddamn motivational speech or
something like that. I just wanted to share with you

102
00:11:27.690 --> 00:11:34.450
something that's definitely having a positive impact on my
daily experience and thus the rest of my life, you know, um,

103
00:11:35.360 --> 00:11:40.610
and hopefully you take some time to think about it yourself,
man. If you want to talk more or in more detail about this,

104
00:11:40.610 --> 00:11:46.610
hit me up on Discord, man. I don't know if everyone
listening knows this, but you can join the Discord server.

105
00:11:46.610 --> 00:11:50.970
You don't have to pay any money. You don't have to fucking
do anything but create an account. Join the community, come

106
00:11:50.970 --> 00:11:57.460

And, uh, live your life in English, my friend. But I'mma get

107
00:11:57.460 --> 00:12:01.820
out of here, man. I just wanted to leave that on your
brains. Hopefully you enjoyed this episode and you got a

108
00:12:01.820 --> 00:12:09.110
couple of things to think about. This is Life in English. I
am your host, Tony Kaizen, and I'll talk to you soon. Peace!

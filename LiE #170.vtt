00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:06.520
What's up, my friend? This is the Life in English podcast,
and I am your sensei, Tony Kaizen. And in this episode, I'm

2
00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:12.990
going to tell you a joke in the form of a story. The joke
comes from a post on Reddit, and the title was "What's a

3
00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:21.460
joke that's so stupid it's funny?" And when I say "so stupid
it's funny", I mean, the level of stupidity is so high that

4
00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:28.980
the only thing you can do is laugh about it. It's not
necessarily funny, but it's so stupid, it makes you laugh,

5
00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:35.360
you know what I'm saying? Now the joke is a story about a
woman and a man who decided to play a little game while on a

6
00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:42.030
flight from Los Angeles to New York, and one of them ends up
losing a lot of money. So I'm going to read it to you now,

7
00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:48.690
and then I'll explain a few keywords and phrases that you
might find useful in your next conversation. Alright? So

8
00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:58.300
let's get into it. "A man and a woman are seated next to
each other on a flight from Los Angeles to New York. The man

9
00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:05.300
asked the woman if she would like to play a fun game. The
woman, tired, just wants to take a nap, so she politely

10
00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:11.780
declines and rolls over to the window to catch a few winks.
The man persists and explains that the game is easy and a

11
00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:21.450
lot of fun. He says, 'I ask you a question, and if you don't
know the answer, you pay me $5 and vice versa.' Again,

12
00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:29.170
she declines and tries to get some sleep. The man, now
agitated, says, 'Okay, if you don't know the answer, you pay

13
00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:37.840
me $5. And if I don't know the answer, I'll pay you $500.'
And this catches the woman's attention and figuring there

14
00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:45.770
will be no end to the torment, she agrees to the game. The
man asked the first question: 'What's the distance from the

15
00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:54.080
earth to the moon?' The woman doesn't say a word. She
reaches into her purse, pulls out a $5 bill, and hands it to

16
00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:58.310
the man. 'Okay', says the man, 'your turn'.

17
00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:08.790
She asks, 'What goes up a hill with three legs and comes
down with four legs?' The man, puzzled, takes his laptop and

18
00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:16.840
searches all his references. No answer. He connects to the
in-flight WiFi and searches on Google and YouTube. No

19
00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:26.380
answer. Frustrated, he sends a text to all his friends and
co-workers and still no luck. After an hour, he wakes the

20
00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:28.560
woman and hands her $500.

21
00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:36.940
The woman thanks him and turns back to get more sleep. The
man -- who is more than a little annoyed -- nudges the woman

22
00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:46.010
and asks, 'Well, what's the answer?' Without a word, the
woman reaches into her purse, hands the man $5, and goes

23
00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:52.970
back to sleep." Alright, my friend.

24
00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:58.480
As I always say, don't worry if you don't understand the
joke. Humor can be difficult to comprehend if you're not

25
00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:04.020
familiar with the language. But I will say that in my
experience, when you can understand jokes and funny stories

26
00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:09.990
without the need for captions or explanations, it's a sign
that you're at an advanced level of comprehension. I

27
00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:16.480
recommend you try listening to stand-up comedy and pay
attention to the words they choose, how they tell stories,

28
00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:22.770
how they use their faces, their voices, and even silence to
take you on a journey with nothing more than their words.

29
00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:29.250
It's truly an art form and it's a great way to get exposed
to a particular culture and its sense of humor. But anyway,

30
00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:34.440
now I'm going to explain a few words and phrases that might
help you understand the story better, as well as help you

31
00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:42.150
sound more natural in your next conversation. Alright, my
friend, Let's do it. So the first thing I want to explain is

32
00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:43.920
"seated next to".

33
00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:50.300
It said, "A man and a woman were seated next to each other
on a flight." And all that means is sitting to the side of

34
00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:58.340
each other or sitting side by side the same way you do on an
airplane, right? You get the idea. So next is "rolls over".

35
00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:05.320
"Rolls over" or "roll over" - the phrasal verb just means to
turn from one side of your body to the other while you're

36
00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:11.520
lying down. So picture her in the airplane seat trying to
get some sleep, and she's lying on one side and she turns

37
00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:19.850
over to the other side to continue sleeping. Hopefully you
can get the idea. So next is "catch a few winks". "She

38
00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:25.440
turned over to catch a few winks." All this means is to
sleep for a short period of time. It basically means to take

39
00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:32.450
a nap. And to be honest with you, I've never heard somebody
say "catch a few winks", like, I understand it, it makes

40
00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:37.980
sense, you can say it if you want. I'm just saying I don't
hear that on a daily basis. I would just say "take a nap".

41
00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:43.820
Some people might say "catch a few Zs" or "catch some
sleep", those things sound more natural to me, but you can

42
00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:51.710
say "catch a few winks", and I imagine most people would
understand what you mean. Alright? But let's continue. Next

43
00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:58.520
is "persist". All this means is "to continue firmly in the
course of action, in spite of difficulty, opposition or

44
00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:06.980
failure". In other words, you do not take no for an answer.
That's what it means to persist. Okay? Next is "vice versa".

45
00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:14.430
All this means, well, the dictionary definition is "with the
main items in the preceding statement the other way around".

46
00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:22.500
The way I would say that is "it works both ways". So if you
don't know the answer, you give me $5. But since it works

47
00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:29.920
both ways, if I don't know the answer, I give you $5. You
see what I'm saying? It works both ways. Alright, the next

48
00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:33.770
word on the list is "agitated". Agitated.

49
00:05:33.790 --> 00:05:39.250
All this means, it's like another word for "irritated" or
"nervous" or something's bothering you. That means you're

50
00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:47.330
agitated. Okay? And next on the list is "figuring" or "to
figure". And all that means is to think or consider or

51
00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:54.660
expect something to be the case. So when...when the story
said, "She figured", or this isn't exactly how it was said,

52
00:05:54.660 --> 00:06:02.400
but the idea is "she figured there would be no end to the
torment". She expected this man to persist and persist and

53
00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:09.530
persist until she said yes. All things considered, she
basically knew, or at least expected that to be the case. If

54
00:06:09.530 --> 00:06:15.100
I keep ignoring him, he's just going to keep asking. Right?
That's what she figured. That's what she understood or

55
00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:19.800
that's the idea she got in her head after thinking about the
situation. I'm sure you get the point. I'm just trying to

56
00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:25.860
explain it in different ways, you know, to make it as clear
as possible. But let's continue. Next on the list is

57
00:06:26.050 --> 00:06:34.750
"torment". To torment someone means to make them feel mental
or physical pain; you cause them to suffer.

58
00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:42.730
See what I'm saying? So she figured that there would be no
end to this man tormenting her. There would be no end to the

59
00:06:42.770 --> 00:06:51.450
torment. You see what I'm saying? Alright, next on the list
is "reaches into". Now "to reach", the verb "reach" just

60
00:06:51.450 --> 00:06:58.890
means to extend your arm typically because you want to grab
something or reach it...or not reach it...but uh...yeah,

61
00:06:59.170 --> 00:07:05.560
bring it into your possession with your hand. So imagine
you're sitting in a chair and your phone is a meter or two

62
00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:12.020
away from you, you have to reach for the phone in order to
grab it. See what I'm saying? You have to extend your arm

63
00:07:12.290 --> 00:07:19.450
and use your hand to grab that object. We call that motion
"reaching for something". Okay? So when she reaches into

64
00:07:19.450 --> 00:07:25.140
something, all that means is to extend your arm and use your
hand to grab something but you're doing it...you're placing

65
00:07:25.140 --> 00:07:31.530
your hand into a container, an enclosed space, like in this
case, her purse or a backpack or a box or something. You

66
00:07:31.530 --> 00:07:39.220
reach into the bag, into the box, into the purse. And then
the next thing I want to explain is "pull out". So she

67
00:07:39.220 --> 00:07:45.510
reached into her purse and pulled out a $5 bill. That's
basically the opposite of "reach into" or it's what happens

68
00:07:45.550 --> 00:07:51.160
after you reach your hand into something. You grab the
object and you pull it out. And you might be asking

69
00:07:51.160 --> 00:07:56.830
yourself, what's the difference between "take out" and "pull
out" and "remove"? In this case, they're all really the same

70
00:07:56.830 --> 00:08:02.320
thing. You might "remove" a dollar from the bag, which is
not the most natural thing to say in this case but it does

71
00:08:02.320 --> 00:08:09.080
make sense. Or you can "take" a dollar out of the bag,
that's just a general phrasal verb in this case. But even

72
00:08:09.080 --> 00:08:15.510
more specific is to "pull out" because you're taking
something out of the bag but with a pulling motion, it's

73
00:08:15.510 --> 00:08:21.570
just more specific but it is the same thing, essentially.
Okay? Hopefully that makes sense. Alright. Next on the list

74
00:08:21.570 --> 00:08:22.690
is "goes up".

75
00:08:23.110 --> 00:08:29.530
To go up just means to move to a higher position or to rise
or to increase. So in this case, "What goes up a hill with

76
00:08:29.530 --> 00:08:34.720
three legs and comes down with four?" "What goes from the
bottom of the mountain to the top?" That's just what it

77
00:08:34.720 --> 00:08:40.630
means to go up - to travel in an upward direction. So next
is "come down", which is basically the opposite. You start

78
00:08:40.630 --> 00:08:47.070
at a high position and you travel to a lower position. You
come down or go down just depending on the situation. Right?

79
00:08:48.280 --> 00:08:53.950
Cool. So next is "puzzled". Puzzled. If you feel puzzled,
that just means you feel confused because you don't

80
00:08:53.950 --> 00:08:59.870
understand a situation or something that somebody has said
or something like that. So, "What goes up a hill with three

81
00:08:59.870 --> 00:09:05.290
legs and comes down with four legs?" When somebody asks you
that, you might feel puzzled because you don't know the

82
00:09:05.320 --> 00:09:13.460
answer. How could I possibly know what that is? I'm confused
by that question. I'm puzzled, you see? Okay, next is the

83
00:09:13.460 --> 00:09:20.650
expression "more than a little". And this is just like a
creative way of saying "a lot". So "He's more than a little

84
00:09:20.650 --> 00:09:28.160
annoyed." Or "He's very annoyed." You see what I'm saying? I
wouldn't say "a lot of annoyed" because in this case, you

85
00:09:28.160 --> 00:09:32.840
know, "a lot of" is for like amount and quantities, "a lot
of people", "a lot of money", things like that. But

86
00:09:32.880 --> 00:09:40.940
"annoyed" is like a feeling. So I would say "very annoyed".
Hopefully that makes sense to you. So if somebody says, "I'm

87
00:09:40.940 --> 00:09:46.180
more than a little upset", it just means "I'm very upset",
right? "I've got more than a little bit of money." "I got

88
00:09:46.520 --> 00:09:50.670
quite a bit of money." And that's not...that example isn't
the most natural but I'm just trying to get you to

89
00:09:50.720 --> 00:09:59.990
understand, it's the same thing as saying "a lot". Okay? 
Alright, next is "nudges". To nudge someone is to prod or to

90
00:09:59.990 --> 00:10:06.640
poke someone in a gentle way, typically with your elbow or
your finger because you want their attention. So imagine

91
00:10:06.640 --> 00:10:12.600
them sitting on the plane next to each other. He's not going
to punch her or shove her or push her aggressively to get

92
00:10:12.600 --> 00:10:17.220
her attention. He just *motions nudging* just pokes her
like, boop, boop, boop, boop with the elbow or the finger.

93
00:10:17.220 --> 00:10:23.360
You know what I'm talking about. We call that action nudging
somebody, right? We *motions nudging* tap them gently with

94
00:10:23.360 --> 00:10:30.580
our elbow or finger to get their attention. And last is, "go
back". I think the last line was something like, "She gave

95
00:10:30.580 --> 00:10:37.040
him $5 and went back to sleep," or...or "she goes back to
sleep". Something of that nature. In this case, in phrases

96
00:10:37.040 --> 00:10:45.630
like that, it just means to return to some activity. So if I
go back to sleep, it means I return to my sleep. If I go

97
00:10:45.630 --> 00:10:51.330
back to watching the movie, it means I return to watching
the movie. I start watching it again or I resume that

98
00:10:51.330 --> 00:10:58.560
activity. You see what I'm saying? That's the basic idea.
Hopefully that makes sense. Okay, cool. Alright, my friend,

99
00:10:58.590 --> 00:11:03.510
I'd like to thank you so much for your time and attention as
always. I really hope you enjoyed this episode of The Life

100
00:11:03.560 --> 00:11:10.080
in English podcast. I'm your host, Tony Kaizen, and I will
talk to you soon. Alright. Peace!

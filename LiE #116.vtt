00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:53.970
In the past six or seven months, I've been posting quite a few videos on social media, particularly TikTok.


00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:57.510
And during that time, a lot of videos have gone viral.


00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.570
I've gained hundreds of thousands of followers and things like that.


00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:04.440
Lots of views and attention and things of that nature.


00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:05.550
I don't say that to brag.


00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:09.460
I'm just stating the facts kind of to set up what I'm about to say.


00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:14.730
The.. The question of this episode, the real subject of the episode...


00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:18.000
because I've noticed some things like after going, let's say,


00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:24.210
viral a few times on TikTok and reaching a level of, let's say,


00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:30.980
I don't know, followers, likes and views, and attention and things like that on social media.


00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:36.920
You kind of learn or at least I've learned a few things or just noticed a few things during that time.


00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:44.960
And one of them is that people really do treat you differently based on your perceived status.


00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:46.110
You know what I mean?


00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:49.400
That's something that may sound obvious, and it's kind of always been true.


00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:53.240
But when you experience it for yourself, it's kind of weird how somebody,


00:01:53.630 --> 00:02:01.580
for example, if you're a creator, you make YouTube videos, music, you're a streamer, a painter, a photographer, whatever it is,


00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:05.360
you do some type of creative work and you're posting it online for people to see.


00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:11.120
And you would hope that one day you can get paid to do what you really enjoy doing. Right?


00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:14.960
A lot of times, especially in the past, you know, eight to ten years ago,


00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:20.570
if you told somebody that you made YouTube videos...


00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:23.510
Like, everybody asks, you know, "What do you do? What do you do for a living?"


00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:26.960
If you told them, "Oh, I make YouTube videos."


00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:35.550
They'd look at you like, "Oh... So, but you don't have a job or you just make videos for the internet, is that what you do?"


00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:41.330
And now there's people making more money than doctors just putting videos on YouTube.


00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:45.690
It's pretty crazy when you stop and think about it.


00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:50.640
But anyway, getting back to what I was saying, it's like, in the past, people..


00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:55.300
It was something that people kind of looked down at, like, as if it was a joke. It was just a hobby.


00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:59.490
And now people have actually made careers doing those very same activities;


00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:05.580
posting their photography online, YouTube videos, Instagram videos, and things like that.


00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:08.730
Online courses, music, all types of content.


00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:14.740
You know, content creator has become a job that one can do to earn money.


00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:22.600
And I think any content creator, even if you're not a content creator, so to speak, you're just posting things online.


00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:28.660
A lot of people want to get attention and notoriety and likes and views and subscribers and followers,


00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:32.470
and, you know, to feel or to be famous for something.


00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:38.290
Now, maybe they don't think about it in that way, but you want to get lots of attention and notoriety for what you do.


00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:42.700
You want to be famous on some level, even if that's not your main motivation.


00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:48.610
You want to be known. You want your work or what you do to be known. Right?


00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:53.090
And it's funny because I noticed that people...


00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:56.390
Like, celebrities, for example, people act different around a lot of celebrities.


00:03:56.390 --> 00:04:03.200
because they see celebrities as these superior, hard to reach, unattainable figures.


00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:10.100
They don't see them as people anymore because you see them all the time on TV or on stage or whatever it is, and they're famous.


00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:14.230
And for whatever reason, you just don't see them as a human being anymore.


00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:20.410
Like your favorite musician or actor or whatever, if you just saw them walking down the street, that's not a normal person to you.


00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:26.880
They're on, they're on a different level socially in terms of status, for whatever reason.


00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:32.730
They're just a person, but because they're famous, because they do something that you love and appreciate on a regular basis,


00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:41.070
and because it's loved and appreciated by hundreds or thousands of millions of people, they elevate the status in your mind.


00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:45.600
For that reason, you treat them differently, you see them differently, you value them differently.


00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:52.410
And what I noticed is that it's the same concept with people that go viral on social media, people that get famous on social media.


00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:56.640
Now, of course, social media is fucking fake. It's artificial, it's not real life.


00:04:56.640 --> 00:05:01.290
But at the same time, attention is real, you know?


00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:06.570
And when you start to get a certain level of attention or a following or whatever you want to call it,


00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:08.820
people look at you and treat you different.


00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:15.460
Like, if you tell somebody, "I make YouTube videos." You know, the first thing they want to know is what?


00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:19.540
How many followers do you have? How many subscribers do you have? Right?


00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:23.020
And based on your response, that's how seriously they're going to take you.


00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:27.170
If you say, "Oh, you know, one hundred two hundred."


00:05:27.670 --> 00:05:34.180
"Oh, that's cool. So it's like a hobby for you, right? You just started? Or how long have you been doing it?" They don't take you seriously.


00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:39.160
But if you ask.. If they ask you the same question and you say, "Ah, four point six million subscribers."


00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:44.350
"Wow. Wow, what's your channel? Let me, what do you do? Let me check it out." Now, they're interested.


00:05:44.350 --> 00:05:50.320
Now they want to see why so many people are interested or follow what you do.


00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:51.760
Now that.. Now you have their respect.


00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:57.130
Based on this number of people that have clicked a button to follow the work that you do.


00:05:57.130 --> 00:05:59.860
Now, it's valuable. Now, it has meaning. You know?


00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:06.500
And I'm not saying that like... I understand that not all content is equal in value,


00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:11.720
and I also understand that value is subjective because what I think is good content, you might not.


00:06:11.750 --> 00:06:14.180
So I'm not trying to make any point when I say that.


00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:16.790
It's just an observation that people respect you..


00:06:16.790 --> 00:06:20.960
The same way people might respect you if you're famous or not famous or if you're rich or poor.


00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:23.330
It's the same thing with this social media shit.


00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:29.810
Just because you got a million followers on social media, people really like, look at you and treat you differently.


00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:35.820
You know, like if somebody asked you, "Oh, you got a TikTok?" Or "Are you on TikTok?"


00:06:35.820 --> 00:06:37.410
"Yeah, yeah, I make videos, blah blah blah."


00:06:37.590 --> 00:06:39.070
"Oh, what's your profile? Oh, OK."


00:06:39.100 --> 00:06:41.310
They look at it, and what are they looking for?


00:06:41.340 --> 00:06:45.510
How many likes and followers you have. They just want to check your status.


00:06:45.850 --> 00:06:49.840
And what I noticed is, like, I could be..


00:06:49.840 --> 00:06:56.560
This has happened to me, I'd be talking to somebody and, of course, the fucking boring ass question,


00:06:56.560 --> 00:07:02.050
"What do you do?" always comes into the conversation if it's somebody you don't know that well.


00:07:02.050 --> 00:07:09.760
And I'll say, "Oh, I teach English online, that kind of thing, and I post videos on YouTube and TikTok, I have a podcast."


00:07:09.910 --> 00:07:13.030
"Oh, that's cool. You know, do you have a link to some of your stuff?"


00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:19.050
You send them a link. And I remember back when I had like sixty thousand followers on TikTok.


00:07:19.570 --> 00:07:22.630
and I was talking to these girls and they pulled up my profile.


00:07:23.610 --> 00:07:25.760
And as soon as I saw had sixty thousand followers, they were like,


00:07:25.770 --> 00:07:31.350
"Oh my God, you're famous! I've actually seen one of your videos before. I can't believe I'm talking to a famous person."


00:07:33.650 --> 00:07:35.810
And it kind of caught me off guard, it was kind of weird, like,


00:07:35.810 --> 00:07:39.260
nobody has ever said something like that to me before. So it was kind of weird.


00:07:39.710 --> 00:07:42.650
And then the conversation was kind of, like, different.


00:07:42.650 --> 00:07:46.790
The way they spoke to me was a little bit different, like they were more interested in the conversation,


00:07:46.790 --> 00:07:51.770
and you could feel that there was more respect or admiration in the conversation.


00:07:52.040 --> 00:07:55.070
And the same thing happened recently.


00:07:56.260 --> 00:07:58.960
I showed one of my family members or I shouldn't say it that way.


00:07:58.990 --> 00:08:05.600
One of my family members downloaded TikTok and saw one of my videos that had went viral,


00:08:05.660 --> 00:08:09.710
had a few million views on it, and called me and was like,


00:08:09.740 --> 00:08:17.030
"Yo, I just saw one of your videos on TikTok. And it's got millions of views, man, you got hundreds of thousands of followers, man.


00:08:17.030 --> 00:08:22.670
Like, I remember you had mentioned this TikTok thing before, but I didn't know, like, you were big like that!


00:08:22.670 --> 00:08:24.560
Wow, man, that's awesome. I'm really proud of you, blah blah blah."


00:08:25.790 --> 00:08:30.710
And although that's cool, it's like, that kind of goes back to my point,


00:08:30.710 --> 00:08:37.180
I had mentioned to this person before, I had a podcast, I was making YouTube videos, Tik Tok videos, and everything.


00:08:37.190 --> 00:08:38.720
It's like, "Oh, that's cool. Yeah."


00:08:39.470 --> 00:08:46.500
But then when they see that almost eight hundred thousand other people love and follow what you do.


00:08:46.530 --> 00:08:51.000
Then it's like, "Oh, wow, that's so cool. You're great, man, you're awesome. I'm proud of you.


00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:52.650
Man, I didn't know you were famous.


00:08:52.650 --> 00:08:55.800
I didn't know that you were actually good at what you do.


00:08:55.830 --> 00:08:59.610
I just thought, you know, you were making silly little videos or whatever."


00:09:00.900 --> 00:09:06.930
So just because they see this big number on your profile or something like that, then they take you seriously, right?


00:09:06.930 --> 00:09:12.420
It's like that saying, "Nobody loves you or supports you until everybody loves you or supports you."


00:09:12.570 --> 00:09:14.610
Which is kind of funny to me. You know?


00:09:15.520 --> 00:09:20.560
Because, it's like so many people are going to respect, appreciate, and admire you or what you do.


00:09:20.590 --> 00:09:27.270
based on everybody else's opinion of what you do and who you are. You know?


00:09:27.270 --> 00:09:28.920
It could be as simple as that.


00:09:28.920 --> 00:09:33.960
Nothing could change from today to tomorrow, except the amount of followers or attention you're getting,


00:09:33.960 --> 00:09:38.220
and that simple thing will change the amount of respect that somebody has for you.


00:09:38.220 --> 00:09:41.630
Isn't that fucking weird? That's weird.


00:09:42.710 --> 00:09:46.010
And what's even more strange, trying to get to the point of this episode,


00:09:46.010 --> 00:09:53.330
is what I noticed during these last six to seven months that I've been posting a lot more videos and content and growing my,


00:09:53.510 --> 00:09:59.690
let's say, audience and my reach and getting more attention and notoriety and things like that for the stuff I'm doing,


00:10:00.590 --> 00:10:03.740
is that the number one question I get from everybody...


00:10:03.860 --> 00:10:08.120
Man, woman, young, old, doesn't matter what country they're from.


00:10:08.120 --> 00:10:12.290
The number one question people always ask when I tell them I have a podcast.


00:10:12.290 --> 00:10:17.270
or I'm making videos on TikTok or YouTube videos, I teach English and stuff like that.


00:10:17.510 --> 00:10:19.880
The number one question is,


00:10:20.270 --> 00:10:21.680
"Are you getting paid to do it?"


00:10:23.160 --> 00:10:24.420
"How much money do you make?"


00:10:24.420 --> 00:10:26.010
"How much money is YouTube paying you?"


00:10:26.310 --> 00:10:28.130
"How much money are you making on TikTok?"


00:10:28.170 --> 00:10:31.170
"Which social media platforms pay you to do what you do?"


00:10:31.680 --> 00:10:32.730
"Are you getting paid?"


00:10:34.090 --> 00:10:35.500
It's the number one question.

00:10:36.040 --> 00:10:40.360
But you know what somebody has never asked me in the three years I've been teaching English online.


00:10:40.360 --> 00:10:45.310
and this last six to eight months that I've been really posting a lot of content?


00:10:45.310 --> 00:10:48.790
No one has ever asked me, "Are you happy doing what you're doing?"


00:10:50.010 --> 00:10:52.200
"Do you enjoy doing what you're doing?"


00:10:52.230 --> 00:10:55.110
"Why are you doing what you're doing?"


00:10:56.290 --> 00:11:00.530
Not once... Not once.


00:11:00.530 --> 00:11:02.840
Isn't that fucking weird... You know?


00:11:04.280 --> 00:11:10.700
Maybe it's not weird to you, but the reason I say that, the reason I believe is weird is because it's...


00:11:10.700 --> 00:11:13.280
It's just kind of, it's like, revealing in a sense,


00:11:13.280 --> 00:11:17.300
It kind of reveals the way a lot of people think about what they do all day, every day.


00:11:17.300 --> 00:11:20.840
It's like, if I'm not going to get paid to do it, then I shouldn't do it.


00:11:21.140 --> 00:11:24.650
If you're not getting paid to do it, why should I respect it?


00:11:24.980 --> 00:11:26.840
You know, it's just a hobby.

00:11:27.560 --> 00:11:31.010
You're not getting paid to do it. You're not famous. Nobody cares about it.


00:11:31.010 --> 00:11:35.160
So why should I care? Why should I be impressed?


00:11:35.880 --> 00:11:37.650
You see what I'm saying?


00:11:37.650 --> 00:11:42.660
Because if I had fifty followers, the same amount of content, the same type of content,


00:11:43.630 --> 00:11:46.480
and I only have 50 followers, somebody looks at it and it's like,


00:11:46.960 --> 00:11:49.210
"Oh, that's cool. Good for you, man."


00:11:50.050 --> 00:11:55.570
But if they.. If they see I'm getting thousands of dollars every month to do what I'm doing, you know,


00:11:55.570 --> 00:11:57.850
making more than them at their full-time jobs, it's like,


00:11:57.850 --> 00:12:02.560
"Oh, wow, that's.. That's awesome, man. That's super dope. I didn't know you were famous like that.


00:12:03.040 --> 00:12:05.380
How much are you getting paid? That's cool, man."


00:12:07.300 --> 00:12:13.500
And it's just like... It kind of made me stop and think that it's just..


00:12:13.500 --> 00:12:18.980
It's strange that that's the first question that comes out of people's mouths, that's the most common question that I get asked,


00:12:18.990 --> 00:12:21.480
"Are you getting paid to do it? How much money do you make?"


00:12:23.120 --> 00:12:26.780
And it's just like, is that the only reason that we have to do stuff?


00:12:26.780 --> 00:12:32.270
Now, don't get me wrong, I'm not, like, anti-money, anti-capitalism,


00:12:32.270 --> 00:12:36.620
anti-business, anti-work... Not even in the slightest.


00:12:36.650 --> 00:12:39.950
I am pro all of those things, so don't get me, you know,


00:12:40.550 --> 00:12:43.970
Don't get it twisted or don't misunderstand what I'm trying to say.


00:12:44.150 --> 00:12:52.350
It's just, like, weird that people decide how much they're going to respect and or admire you.


00:12:52.350 --> 00:12:56.820
based on how much money you have or how much social status you have.


00:12:57.030 --> 00:13:02.850
And instead of, like, what you are actually doing, you see what I'm saying?


00:13:02.850 --> 00:13:04.710
It doesn't really matter what I'm doing.


00:13:05.770 --> 00:13:11.890
It matters like how much I'm getting paid to do it, that's what a lot of people care about, you know?


00:13:11.890 --> 00:13:15.370
And that's just weird. It's really weird.


00:13:17.290 --> 00:13:22.360
Like, I think a better question than, "What do you do?" is "What are you passionate about?"


00:13:22.360 --> 00:13:28.690
Or "Why are you doing what you're doing?" What's your motivation for doing what you do every day?"


00:13:28.780 --> 00:13:33.010
Your job or your career or whatever it is. Or your hobbies, what's the motivation?


00:13:33.010 --> 00:13:34.360
Why do you like those things?


00:13:34.990 --> 00:13:36.740
Are you happy doing those things?


00:13:36.760 --> 00:13:38.320
Do you wish you could be doing something else?


00:13:38.320 --> 00:13:39.610
But it's always, what do you do?


00:13:39.910 --> 00:13:45.130
And based on that question, they're going to create this idea of who you are or what your status is.


00:13:45.130 --> 00:13:49.090
and then give you a certain amount of respect based purely on that.


00:13:51.060 --> 00:13:58.120
And I think that's fucking stupid, you know? For so many reasons. For so many reasons.


00:13:58.120 --> 00:14:03.670
Now, at the end of the day, I don't give a fuck if somebody respects what I do or not or somebody admires what I do or not.


00:14:03.880 --> 00:14:06.430
That's not really the point because I really don't give a fuck.


00:14:06.460 --> 00:14:09.460
It's just something that I noticed that's kind of interesting to think about.


00:14:10.810 --> 00:14:14.260
And I'm sure somebody's asked you that question before, "What do you do?"


00:14:14.260 --> 00:14:18.340
Or if you're.. If you haven't gotten a job or you haven't started a career yet,


00:14:18.370 --> 00:14:19.540
"Well, where are you going to go to school?


00:14:19.540 --> 00:14:20.480
Where are you going to study?


00:14:20.500 --> 00:14:21.940
What are you going to do with your life?"


00:14:22.210 --> 00:14:26.720
And based on your answer, that's the respect or treatment, you know,


00:14:26.720 --> 00:14:29.480
you get a certain level of respect or a certain kind of treatment.


00:14:29.900 --> 00:14:34.340
I'm sure you've experienced that on some level before, and I just think it's weird, man.


00:14:36.460 --> 00:14:51.350
I think it's really weird. You know?


00:14:51.350 --> 00:14:53.000
It's like, don't get me wrong,


00:14:53.030 --> 00:14:59.390
I love money for what it can do because money is nothing more than options when you stop and think about it.


00:14:59.390 --> 00:15:02.960
The more money you have, the more options you have in every situation.


00:15:03.320 --> 00:15:06.260
So I'm not, like, saying money isn't important.


00:15:06.260 --> 00:15:10.280
I'm not saying that you shouldn't get paid because you definitely should.


00:15:10.550 --> 00:15:15.470
But at the same time, you know, at the risk of sounding cliche,


00:15:15.800 --> 00:15:19.100
it's like, it's not all about the money, man. It's not.


00:15:19.700 --> 00:15:24.920
Obviously, getting paid is important and, you know, it should be one of your top priorities.


00:15:24.920 --> 00:15:29.120
But at the same time, like, judging somebody based on how much they get paid.


00:15:29.780 --> 00:15:38.000
or that being your number one interest when meeting somebody or getting to know this person, that's weird. You know?


00:15:38.880 --> 00:15:46.290
The fact that nobody ever asks, like, "Are you happy doing what you're doing or what's the motivation for doing what you're doing?


00:15:48.240 --> 00:15:51.510
What are you hoping to achieve doing what you're doing right now?


00:15:51.660 --> 00:15:53.070
Where are you going with this?


00:15:53.730 --> 00:15:55.500
What's your vision? What's your plan?


00:15:55.800 --> 00:15:59.700
You know, what are the difficulties? What are the easy parts?


00:15:59.700 --> 00:16:01.230
What are your strengths and weaknesses?


00:16:01.260 --> 00:16:04.940
Could I help you, you know, achieve more or something like that?"


00:16:04.950 --> 00:16:05.550
Nobody.


00:16:05.910 --> 00:16:12.060
Most people never ask these kinds of questions. You know?


00:16:12.060 --> 00:16:15.480
It's kind of weird, no?


00:16:15.480 --> 00:16:17.040
It's always just, "Are you getting paid to do it?


00:16:17.070 --> 00:16:20.620
How much do you get paid? How much do you get paid?"


00:16:21.910 --> 00:16:24.900
That's it.


00:16:24.900 --> 00:16:34.600
I don't know, man. And I'm not saying like... Hmm. What am I not saying?


00:17:05.090 --> 00:17:13.350
I don't know, like I said a few times already, I just think it's weird, man. I just... It's weird. Like...


00:17:23.850 --> 00:17:26.130
Like, the fact that even the people close to you,


00:17:26.130 --> 00:17:29.790
it could be your parents, your brothers and sisters, your best friends,


00:17:29.790 --> 00:17:38.820
a lot of times, are not at all interested in your happiness or your level of fulfillment or your sense of purpose or meaning in life.


00:17:38.850 --> 00:17:47.620
All they care about is your status. You don't think that's strange? Like...


00:17:47.620 --> 00:17:50.880
And maybe it's human nature. I don't know. I don't know.


00:17:50.900 --> 00:17:56.510
Maybe it's human nature, but that's... That's fucking weird. It's weird.


00:17:58.030 --> 00:18:04.690
All people care about is your status and all you lower, equal to, or higher than them in status.


00:18:04.690 --> 00:18:14.550
And based on that, that's how they treat you. That's how much interest they have in you. You know?


00:18:14.550 --> 00:18:19.920
Stupid... It's really stupid because at the end of the day, bro...


00:18:19.920 --> 00:18:24.370
When you really stop and think... There's a... There's a couple of things to think about.


00:18:24.370 --> 00:18:30.050
The first one is once you make a certain amount of money, your life isn't going to change, bro.


00:18:30.990 --> 00:18:38.760
Once you have enough money to easily cover all your bills and expenses and entertainment and things like that, you know...


00:18:38.760 --> 00:18:43.680
Adding more money than you can actually spend isn't going to change the quality of your life.


00:18:44.070 --> 00:18:45.720
Hopefully, you can agree with me on that.


00:18:46.290 --> 00:18:50.520
That's just one more reason that money is not as important as people make it seem.


00:18:50.730 --> 00:18:55.800
It's very important, extremely important. But what I'm saying is it's not everything.


00:18:55.800 --> 00:19:01.390
And I know that sounds obvious and cliche, but a lot of people really don't think about it that way.


00:19:01.390 --> 00:19:04.510
It's like we just need more money, more money, more money so I can do more stuff.


00:19:04.540 --> 00:19:07.030
But if you stop and think about what you really want to do,


00:19:07.060 --> 00:19:09.700
you probably don't need as much money as you think you do.


00:19:10.120 --> 00:19:15.130
Your main problem is probably that you spend too much money, but that's a whole nother conversation.


00:19:15.130 --> 00:19:19.550
And thing number two... How can I say this?


00:19:33.140 --> 00:19:39.290
And then number two is that you could be making $100,000 a year, $500,000 a year,


00:19:39.290 --> 00:19:42.440
a million dollars a year and be fucking miserable.


00:19:44.160 --> 00:19:47.100
Miserable with all the problems that money brings,


00:19:47.100 --> 00:19:52.080
all the stress of maintaining that level of wealth, let's say.


00:19:53.330 --> 00:19:59.990
You could be miserable doing the job that you fucking hate, working 50, 60, 80 hours a week, doing something you don't even like,


00:20:00.200 --> 00:20:05.510
but you've got the respect and admiration of everybody because you got more dollars in your bank account than they do.


00:20:06.260 --> 00:20:08.120
or because you're on TV more than they are.


00:20:09.640 --> 00:20:13.090
That is fucking stupid, bro. That's fucking stupid.


00:20:13.120 --> 00:20:18.020
Whereas somebody over here could be making $40,000 a year...


00:20:18.020 --> 00:20:23.360
Happiest person, you know, in their state. You know what I'm saying?


00:20:23.360 --> 00:20:29.250
The happiest person amongst a million people could be making $40,000 a year doing something that they love.


00:20:29.270 --> 00:20:33.350
And not only something that they love, but that has a genuine impact on the people around them,


00:20:33.350 --> 00:20:36.840
a positive impact on the people around them.


00:20:36.860 --> 00:20:41.060
They're just not famous for it or they're not getting paid a crazy amount of money for it.


00:20:41.240 --> 00:20:47.260
Which one is more valuable? You know what I'm saying?


00:20:47.260 --> 00:20:48.820
Obviously, it's just.. it's a question of opinion.


00:20:49.060 --> 00:20:55.880
We might not agree on this, and I'm not saying, again, that like, money isn't important.


00:20:55.900 --> 00:20:57.790
I'm just saying it's not the only thing.


00:20:58.030 --> 00:21:02.530
And that's why I think it's fucking weird that the number one question people always ask is,


00:21:02.530 --> 00:21:04.570
What do you do and how much do you get paid for it?


00:21:07.340 --> 00:21:12.390
It's never like, are you happy? Do you have a sense of meaning and purpose?


00:21:12.400 --> 00:21:16.450
Do you have any direction in your life? Are you trying to get somewhere in particular?


00:21:17.400 --> 00:21:24.230
You know, why are you doing what you're doing? Never.


00:21:27.820 --> 00:21:37.410
I don't know, man. I don't know. I guess..


00:21:37.410 --> 00:21:41.370
What I'm trying to say is I just noticed something that was kind of already obvious,


00:21:41.370 --> 00:21:49.600
but when you experience it for yourself, you feel like you're just having this revelation where it's like, man...


00:21:49.600 --> 00:21:56.530
So many people are worried about the wrong things, the wrong things in life, like, for real.


00:21:56.560 --> 00:21:58.090
And I'm not. I'm also, again,


00:21:58.120 --> 00:22:03.250
I'm not saying that happiness is the most important thing in life either, because I don't think it is.


00:22:03.250 --> 00:22:05.080
Happiness, like every other feeling, comes and goes.


00:22:05.110 --> 00:22:09.970
Now, you can, of course, do things that bring happiness to you, and that's cool,


00:22:09.970 --> 00:22:16.390
But I think meaning, purpose, and impact are some of the most important things in life...


00:22:16.390 --> 00:22:23.410
Doing something meaningful, purposeful, something that has an impact on yourself and or the people around you in a positive way.


00:22:23.740 --> 00:22:28.660
I think that's important. I think doing something meaningful brings happiness.


00:22:28.660 --> 00:22:33.550
When you have a reason, a compelling reason to get up and go to work in the morning.


00:22:33.580 --> 00:22:39.650
Maybe that sounds cliche to you, but I still think it's real shit. You know? That's important.


00:22:40.770 --> 00:22:44.610
Not like how much more money you make than the people around you.


00:22:44.670 --> 00:22:47.100
Or how many people recognize you when you leave the house,


00:22:47.130 --> 00:22:54.370
How many fucking people click a follow button on their cell phone while they're scrolling on social media.


00:22:54.370 --> 00:23:04.820
Who gives? Who gives a fuck? You know? Who gives a fuck, bro? Who cares? Who cares?


00:23:04.820 --> 00:23:06.470
I don't give a fuck how much money you make.


00:23:06.620 --> 00:23:08.600
I don't give a fuck how many followers you got.


00:23:08.780 --> 00:23:10.850
I don't give a fuck how much attention you get.


00:23:12.690 --> 00:23:14.670
Are you doing anything meaningful with your life?


00:23:15.870 --> 00:23:16.710
Are you happy?


00:23:17.850 --> 00:23:20.830
You like what you see when you look in the mirror?


00:23:20.830 --> 00:23:24.430
You know? What do you do for fun? And why do you do it?


00:23:25.550 --> 00:23:27.020
Aren't those interesting questions?


00:23:27.020 --> 00:23:31.950
Not like how many fucking dollars you got in your bank account? Who gives a shit? Who cares?


00:23:35.180 --> 00:23:38.390
It's like, so many people, that's the topic of their conversation...


00:23:38.390 --> 00:23:42.860
Other people and what they got going on in their lives, what their status is,


00:23:42.860 --> 00:23:46.970
How much money they have, their drama and shit like that.


00:23:51.730 --> 00:23:53.830
I don't know, man. I don't know.


00:23:55.460 --> 00:24:01.250
I don't even know if I've arrived at any particular point with everything I've said in this episode,


00:24:01.250 --> 00:24:04.460
It was just something that I was thinking about, so I decided I was going to sit down.


00:24:04.460 --> 00:24:07.670
and talk and try to figure out what I really think because I know how I feel,


00:24:07.970 --> 00:24:10.400
but I don't know exactly what I think about that yet.


00:24:11.340 --> 00:24:17.030
I just think it's really strange. It's always, "What do you do? And how much do you make?"


00:24:18.680 --> 00:24:26.210
And I just think, especially for young people, I hope with all my rambling up until this point that somebody,


00:24:26.210 --> 00:24:29.030
regardless of their age, but particularly young people,


00:24:29.030 --> 00:24:36.350
If you're listening to this right now, this is something I wish I would have heard at 16, 17, 18, 20, 21.


00:24:36.650 --> 00:24:40.550
I wish somebody would have sat down and told me, like,


00:24:41.060 --> 00:24:44.120
you have to understand that your life is yours and yours only,


00:24:44.120 --> 00:24:48.650
and you are going to fuck up your entire life trying to follow somebody else's dreams.


00:24:48.680 --> 00:24:52.580
or live by somebody else's guidelines or meet somebody else's standards.


00:24:53.030 --> 00:24:55.370
You are going to fuck up your entire life.


00:24:55.370 --> 00:25:00.020
The.. Some of the best years of your life. Some of the most important years of your life.


00:25:00.020 --> 00:25:08.680
Every year is important, but I really think, you know, 16 to 28, bro, you know, good time and life, man.


00:25:08.680 --> 00:25:11.710
Not too many responsibilities, as long as you're smart.


00:25:11.710 --> 00:25:12.670
You can take a lot of risks.


00:25:12.670 --> 00:25:15.780
You can fuck up and people will forgive you for it. You know what I'm saying?


00:25:15.790 --> 00:25:20.470
You can recover from big mistakes, from big perceived failures and shit like that.


00:25:20.740 --> 00:25:30.510
You know, you're probably a lot more fearless because you feel like you have time, you feel that you can do anything.


00:25:30.530 --> 00:25:31.820
You know, you're creative.


00:25:31.850 --> 00:25:34.760
You probably still have a little bit of spirit left if public school and.


00:25:34.760 --> 00:25:39.800
your parents haven't fucking murdered it inside you already, you feel what I'm saying?


00:25:39.800 --> 00:25:43.600
And I just think so many young people have the wrong idea of what success actually is.


00:25:43.610 --> 00:25:50.450
So many young people have the wrong idea of what it means to live a happy, meaningful life,


00:25:50.480 --> 00:25:57.950
of what's actually going to bring them lasting happiness, not just fleeting, momentary, artificial, cheap happiness.


00:25:58.800 --> 00:25:59.430
You know what I'm saying?


00:25:59.970 --> 00:26:04.410
So, so many young people think, "I got to go to school because that's going to get me a job,


00:26:04.620 --> 00:26:08.260
that's going to get me money, and then I'll be successful. That's going to give me security."


00:26:08.280 --> 00:26:12.180
But who says that's the only way to get happiness, money, and security?


00:26:12.750 --> 00:26:15.750
Why are you doing that? Is it because you genuinely want to?


00:26:16.080 --> 00:26:17.880
Or is it because you feel like you need to?


00:26:17.940 --> 00:26:20.700
Is it because you feel like people are going to judge you if you don't?


00:26:21.810 --> 00:26:26.190
Is it because you don't really know what you want to do and this just seems like the best option at the time?


00:26:26.520 --> 00:26:30.750
It's the best of a bad situation? Why are you doing it?


00:26:32.160 --> 00:26:35.670
What do you really want to do? There's no wrong answers here.


00:26:35.940 --> 00:26:40.710
And if you can imagine what you want to do, that means you can do it.


00:26:40.740 --> 00:26:45.960
God didn't give you an imagination for no reason. And you can't imagine shit that's not possible.


00:26:46.870 --> 00:26:49.750
Now, I'm speaking, obviously within reason. Right?


00:26:49.750 --> 00:26:54.250
You can't grow a fucking extra arm or some shit like that, as far as I know.


00:26:54.250 --> 00:26:57.670
So hopefully, you can follow me and understand I'm saying within reason.


00:26:58.150 --> 00:27:01.780
But if you can imagine yourself doing something for a living or living a certain lifestyle.


00:27:01.780 --> 00:27:05.080
or whatever it is, like, that means it's possible.


00:27:06.050 --> 00:27:07.570
You just gotta figure out how.


00:27:07.570 --> 00:27:12.220
And it's, I know it's easier said than done. But that means it's possible.


00:27:12.460 --> 00:27:15.760
So why not focus all of your time and energy on that.


00:27:15.760 --> 00:27:21.790
as opposed to taking this other route that somebody else laid for you, even though they've never been you?


00:27:23.820 --> 00:27:28.650
They don't fucking know you, or what you've been through, or who you are, what you want, what's important to you.


00:27:28.680 --> 00:27:33.180
You decide those things and then you create the life around those things.


00:27:33.900 --> 00:27:40.180
So that way you love the life that you live. You see what I'm saying?


00:27:40.180 --> 00:27:49.780
Now, obviously, not everybody's going to be a famous soccer player or a musician or a painter or fucking whatever, obviously.


00:27:49.780 --> 00:27:59.240
But I'm just saying, like, if money and status are the only things motivating you to do something, bro...


00:27:59.240 --> 00:28:04.370
Good fucking luck, man. Good luck. Let me know how long it lasts.


00:28:05.370 --> 00:28:06.060
You know what I'm saying?


00:28:06.390 --> 00:28:10.800
I really wish somebody would have sat me down at 17 or 18 and told me, like,


00:28:10.800 --> 00:28:13.170
bro, you just need to spend some time by yourself.


00:28:15.110 --> 00:28:21.080
Put your phone down. Say peace to the friends. Leave the girls alone. Turn off the TV. Stop smoking.


00:28:21.080 --> 00:28:27.080
Whatever, whatever you do to pass the time or to waste time or distract yourself. Put it all to the side.


00:28:27.110 --> 00:28:30.830
Just sit down with yourself and figure out what do, what do I want to do?


00:28:30.860 --> 00:28:33.710
What am I interested in? What makes me tick?


00:28:34.950 --> 00:28:39.270
What would I like to get up in the morning and do? What seems cool to me?


00:28:39.270 --> 00:28:41.670
Regardless of what anybody else thinks about that.


00:28:41.670 --> 00:28:44.550
Regardless of how much money I would make doing it.


00:28:44.550 --> 00:28:45.990
Just figure out what you want first.


00:28:47.130 --> 00:28:51.350
Until you figure that out, in my opinion, you're going to waste a lot of time.


00:28:51.350 --> 00:28:53.610
Now, obviously, it takes time to figure out what you want,


00:28:53.610 --> 00:28:57.270
and sometimes you have to try many different things to figure out what you want.


00:28:57.270 --> 00:28:59.070
But that's the point.. Is you're trying.


00:28:59.730 --> 00:29:04.450
A lot of people aren't trying to get anywhere in particular or they're not trying to get to where they want to be.


00:29:04.470 --> 00:29:12.090
They're just trying not to fail. And their idea of failure is somebody else's idea of failure.


00:29:12.630 --> 00:29:14.630
They're just trying not to disappoint somebody,


00:29:14.640 --> 00:29:20.730
Maybe their parents or their husband or their kids or whoever the fuck or people that don't even know or care about them.


00:29:21.510 --> 00:29:24.630
Just trying not to disappoint those people or be judged by those people.


00:29:25.410 --> 00:29:27.060
They're not trying to get to where they want to be.


00:29:28.210 --> 00:29:33.790
They're just trying to stay away from this place that other people think is the wrong place to be.


00:29:34.640 --> 00:29:36.770
I don't even know if that makes sense, but it's like,


00:29:37.580 --> 00:29:42.710
A lot of people are not trying to get to someplace in particular or achieve a goal that's important to them.


00:29:44.750 --> 00:29:50.910
A lot of people are just...


00:29:50.910 --> 00:29:55.470
Just trying to survive and do what everybody else does and impress everybody else


00:29:55.500 --> 00:29:58.740
and win a game that everybody else is playing.


00:30:00.470 --> 00:30:06.000
But what you got to realize is you can't... You can't win the game,


00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:07.050
I don't know how to say that.


00:30:08.380 --> 00:30:13.320
I don't know.


00:30:29.640 --> 00:30:36.560
I guess what I'm trying to say is a lot of young people, old people as well, but especially young people...


00:30:36.560 --> 00:30:43.580
We fuck up our lives and waste so much time trying to live up to somebody else's expectations.


00:30:43.610 --> 00:30:49.260
Or just do what we were told is the right thing to do...


00:30:49.260 --> 00:30:54.280
Do what we were told is the only thing to do...


00:30:54.280 --> 00:30:57.760
Or just do what we think is going to impress or satisfy other people.


00:30:58.750 --> 00:31:02.530
You know, or distract ourselves from what we know we should be doing,


00:31:02.530 --> 00:31:07.930
distract ourselves from what's difficult because it's not...


00:31:07.930 --> 00:31:13.290
You don't get that immediate gratification from chasing your dreams all the time. You just don't.


00:31:13.560 --> 00:31:14.880
So for that reason, it's like,


00:31:15.090 --> 00:31:19.770
"Oh, I don't know. It's a big decision. What if it's the wrong decision? What if I make a mistake?"


00:31:19.770 --> 00:31:25.470
Then you start doubting yourself and rationalizing your laziness, your anxiety, your fear,


00:31:25.470 --> 00:31:29.250
And you use all that as an excuse not to do what you know you want to do.


00:31:30.090 --> 00:31:35.700
"I'll do it later. Let me get a job, make some money first, and, you know, get established, be secure.


00:31:35.700 --> 00:31:39.980
And then I'll take a risk. Then I'll do what I like."


00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:45.310
By that time, you've already killed any desire, creativity, imagination inside you.


00:31:46.590 --> 00:31:49.890
And now you've created this whole other life for yourself that you didn't even want,


00:31:50.340 --> 00:31:52.700
and now you have that burden, that responsibility,


00:31:52.710 --> 00:31:55.590
and then you're going to think about trying to go back to the other side?


00:31:57.190 --> 00:32:00.610
While managing all this shit that you've created for yourself over here?


00:32:00.610 --> 00:32:06.910
It's stupid, it's fucking dumb. It's fucking dumb. Don't do it.


00:32:06.910 --> 00:32:08.720
If you're a young person listening to this right now,


00:32:08.740 --> 00:32:13.640
I'm not trying to be on some cliche, like, "You can do whatever you want and be whatever you want."


00:32:13.660 --> 00:32:14.440
Fuck that.


00:32:15.350 --> 00:32:17.810
It is true, but that's not the entire idea.


00:32:17.810 --> 00:32:25.610
You can do or be whatever you want if you're willing to do the work every single mother fucking day.


00:32:25.610 --> 00:32:28.730
And it's going to suck sometimes. It's going to be hard sometimes.


00:32:28.760 --> 00:32:33.740
Nobody's going to help you. Nobody gives a fuck about you. If you win or lose.


00:32:33.740 --> 00:32:35.390
Most people want to see you lose.


00:32:36.230 --> 00:32:39.360
So you can do whatever you want. Not going to be easy.


00:32:39.380 --> 00:32:42.110
You can be whatever you want. Nobody cares.


00:32:42.860 --> 00:32:48.320
So you better make sure whatever you're trying to do or be is important to you.


00:32:49.680 --> 00:32:55.200
That's all that matters, especially as a young person with no wife, no husband, no girlfriend, boyfriend, no kids,


00:32:55.920 --> 00:32:59.040
no mortgage, no car payment, no bills.


00:33:00.700 --> 00:33:09.230
What you want to be and do is the most important thing. That's what I'm trying to say.


00:33:09.590 --> 00:33:12.530
You can do or be whatever you want in this life, I truly believe that.


00:33:12.530 --> 00:33:15.410
And I'm not saying that just because I'm an American.


00:33:15.410 --> 00:33:18.140
I really believe that, bro. I really do.


00:33:18.870 --> 00:33:22.920
But you have to put in the work.


00:33:24.300 --> 00:33:28.530
It's the only thing that separates most people. It's not talent, it's not luck or any of that.


00:33:28.530 --> 00:33:38.410
All that shit is secondary or tertiary in comparison to effort, consistent effort over time.


00:33:39.400 --> 00:33:41.770
Intentional, focused effort over time.


00:33:45.530 --> 00:33:48.860
So if you're hearing this right now and you can identify with what I'm saying, like,


00:33:48.860 --> 00:33:52.040
You've thought about these things before, you've heard these things before,


00:33:52.070 --> 00:33:55.430
You've had these conversations with your parents or friends or other people,


00:33:55.940 --> 00:34:01.820
I'm telling you, man, just take some time to be by yourself and figure out, "What exactly do I want?"


00:34:04.050 --> 00:34:07.760
And once you figure that out, no matter how long it takes, it might take months or years,


00:34:07.770 --> 00:34:09.870
You might have to do five or six different jobs.


00:34:10.560 --> 00:34:12.210
You might go through different relationships.


00:34:12.240 --> 00:34:15.990
All these things will contribute to what you want your life to be like.


00:34:16.590 --> 00:34:20.220
But you have to live to figure out how to live.


00:34:21.810 --> 00:34:27.710
It takes a lifetime to figure out how to live properly. You know what I'm saying?


00:34:27.710 --> 00:34:36.870
The only way you can figure out how to live properly is by living... Engaging with life, the world around you.


00:34:36.870 --> 00:34:39.630
Experimenting, trying things, making mistakes, learning from the mistakes,


00:34:39.630 --> 00:34:42.840
and then waking up tomorrow and doing better than you did it yesterday.


00:34:43.530 --> 00:34:48.640
You can't fuckin figure out those things or get to where you want to be in life


00:34:48.660 --> 00:34:55.890
sitting on the fucking sidelines of the game or watching other people play the game or playing somebody else's game.


00:34:57.730 --> 00:35:03.390
It's not going to happen, bro. It's not going to happen. It's just not.


00:35:03.390 --> 00:35:07.770
So all this talk about, you know, what do you do and how much do you get paid for it?


00:35:07.860 --> 00:35:11.620
Bro, fuck that shit. Fuck that shit.


00:35:11.620 --> 00:35:13.720
It's boring, it's stupid, it's meaningless.


00:35:14.850 --> 00:35:20.590
The question is what's your purpose? Are you happy doing what you're doing?


00:35:20.590 --> 00:35:23.510
Why are you doing it? Are you fulfilled?


00:35:23.900 --> 00:35:29.620
Are you having an impact on yourself or other people around you? That's what you should be thinking about.


00:35:31.880 --> 00:35:37.040
Not what your social status is, although, you know, to a certain extent, that stuff is important, I get it.


00:35:37.040 --> 00:35:43.760
How much money you make, your certain status, and all that type of stuff but, bro...


00:35:43.760 --> 00:35:47.450
If nobody else cared about how much money you make or your social status, would you care?


00:35:49.190 --> 00:35:49.730
Would you?


00:35:53.210 --> 00:35:59.060
I don't know. I'm just saying, man, you got, as far as we know,


00:35:59.080 --> 00:36:03.580
I don't know what you believe, but as far as we know, you got one life.


00:36:03.700 --> 00:36:08.500
Nobody has been able to prove otherwise until now, as far as I know.


00:36:09.750 --> 00:36:12.870
So let's just assume that's true. You got one life.


00:36:13.990 --> 00:36:18.270
You're going to spend it worrying, like, how much more money you can make?


00:36:19.440 --> 00:36:22.320
How many more people you can impress, how much more attention you can get?


00:36:23.700 --> 00:36:27.590
How much more status you can attain?


00:36:27.590 --> 00:36:30.790
That's what life is about for you, bro?


00:36:30.790 --> 00:36:35.560
That's all you think about when you meet somebody for the first time, somebody new?


00:36:35.560 --> 00:36:42.980
I wonder what they do and how much they get paid to do it? That's it?


00:36:42.980 --> 00:36:49.290
I'm not judging, I mean, if that is life for you, then more power to you, my friend.


00:36:49.310 --> 00:36:51.230
I'm just saying it's something to think about.


00:36:51.260 --> 00:37:03.780
Maybe you've never thought about it before. That's all I'm saying. It's just... I don't know.


00:37:16.120 --> 00:37:22.900
I don't know, man, I guess really what I'm saying is conversations in general, and life, in general,


00:37:22.900 --> 00:37:26.680
get so much more interesting when you talk about the shit that really matters.


00:37:29.650 --> 00:37:30.880
I guess that's what I'm trying to say.


00:37:34.960 --> 00:37:42.140
And we'll leave it like that. And have fun fucking editing this shit. We'll see.


00:37:44.060 --> 00:37:44.600
Peace.

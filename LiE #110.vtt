This is the challenge of teaching you slang.

00:00:08.957 --> 00:00:09.797
What's up, everybody.

00:00:09.797 --> 00:00:12.377
You're listening to another episode of life in English.

00:00:12.407 --> 00:00:14.614
I'm your host, Tony Kaizen.

00:00:15.393 --> 00:00:17.277
This is episode number 110.

00:00:17.337 --> 00:00:22.647
And in this episode, like I said, I'm going to be talking about the challenge of teaching you slang.

00:00:22.967 --> 00:00:25.647
Now, this episode was inspired by Skarleth Orellana.

00:00:26.067 --> 00:00:28.677
Forgive me if I'm pronouncing your name incorrectly.

00:00:29.157 --> 00:00:33.807
She sent me a message asking me why I've said so many times that I don't like the word 'slang.'

00:00:34.407 --> 00:00:37.917
I found this question very interesting because no one had ever asked me that before.

00:00:37.917 --> 00:00:40.257
And to be honest, I hadn't noticed that I said it so much.

00:00:41.147 --> 00:00:45.807
Now, in this episode, I'm going to do my best to explain why I don't really appreciate the word 'slang'

00:00:46.047 --> 00:00:49.077
and also why it's so difficult to teach you slang correctly.

00:00:49.347 --> 00:00:52.017
Now, when I say correctly, I mean, in a way that you will clearly understand,

00:00:52.692 --> 00:00:56.232
and that will also help you to sound more natural whenever you use it.

00:00:56.652 --> 00:01:00.582
So let's start with the reason I don't necessarily appreciate the word 'slang.'

00:01:01.422 --> 00:01:09.132
The dictionary defines slang as a type of language that consists of words and phrases that are regarded as very informal,

00:01:09.402 --> 00:01:11.262
are more common in speech than in writing,

00:01:11.502 --> 00:01:15.372
and are typically restricted to a particular context or group of people.

00:01:16.312 --> 00:01:22.362
I guess the reason I don't like the word slang is because when most people think of slang, they think of the way black people talk.

00:01:23.092 --> 00:01:28.422
They think of an extremely informal, grammatically incorrect, hard-to-understand form of speech,

00:01:28.902 --> 00:01:33.822
the type of speech that shows you are uneducated or unintelligent, and that you probably grew up in the streets.

00:01:34.602 --> 00:01:35.802
While I was preparing this episode,

00:01:35.802 --> 00:01:41.562
I actually asked my mom what came to mind when she heard the word 'slang' and she said, "black people."

00:01:42.582 --> 00:01:48.102
As a black American, I am many others like me have found ourselves in situations in which we had to

00:01:48.462 --> 00:01:52.572
'tuck in' our blackness just to be accepted by a particular group of people,

00:01:52.992 --> 00:01:56.742
mainly in job interviews, at work, in business, et cetera...

00:01:57.042 --> 00:02:01.032
situations in which 'educated' white people are the boss

00:02:01.422 --> 00:02:06.192
and the ones that will decide whether or not you get a job, a bank loan or a scholarship.

00:02:07.062 --> 00:02:08.112
Now, if you come in and talk and like,

00:02:08.182 --> 00:02:10.402
"Aye wassup shawty, what's crackin', we finna get it poppin' know'm'talmbout?"

00:02:11.502 --> 00:02:14.442
The manager's going to look at you like you're crazy, or like you're stupid.

00:02:15.182 --> 00:02:16.812
Now, they might not react at the moment,

00:02:16.812 --> 00:02:21.552
but I can almost guarantee you that you won't be getting any job, bank loan, or scholarship.

00:02:22.432 --> 00:02:24.462
In most people's minds when you talk like that,

00:02:24.462 --> 00:02:29.902
it means that you're not capable of being professional, you're not educated, and you can't be taken seriously.

00:02:30.897 --> 00:02:36.717
For decades, people have looked down on the way that some black people talk as if it were incorrect or inferior.

00:02:37.527 --> 00:02:42.957
Almost everything about black American culture was seen as low class, vulgar, and inferior.

00:02:43.587 --> 00:02:47.997
It was only when rap music took over the world that black American culture was accepted

00:02:47.997 --> 00:02:51.732
and then imitated by people of all classes and ethnicities.

00:02:52.272 --> 00:02:54.702
So the reason I don't appreciate the word 'slang'

00:02:54.702 --> 00:03:00.312
is because most of the time people are referring to a way of speaking that they see as incorrect.

00:03:01.002 --> 00:03:06.072
It implies that the way 'educated' people speak, like high-class white people, for example,

00:03:06.312 --> 00:03:11.202
with textbook grammar and pronunciation is the correct way to speak English.

00:03:11.872 --> 00:03:18.492
It implies that any other way of speaking is just street slang and it shouldn't be accepted or respected in professional settings,

00:03:18.822 --> 00:03:23.112
which essentially implies that any other cultural form of communication is incorrect.

00:03:23.712 --> 00:03:30.762
However, I think that what most people refer to as slang is simply a different dialect they don't appreciate or understand.

00:03:31.602 --> 00:03:35.652
'Formal' and 'informal' are rules and guidelines created by someone else,

00:03:35.832 --> 00:03:39.492
but that doesn't mean everyone is going to follow those rules and guidelines.

00:03:40.352 --> 00:03:44.402
If a group of people have a clear and defined system of communication amongst themselves,

00:03:44.972 --> 00:03:47.732
then that system of communication is standard to them.

00:03:48.632 --> 00:03:52.082
It might not be the way you think the language should be used or spoken,

00:03:52.232 --> 00:03:53.672
but that doesn't mean it's incorrect.

00:03:54.632 --> 00:03:55.412
Let me be clear.

00:03:55.652 --> 00:03:59.972
I understand that we must have a standard form of language that is understood universally

00:04:00.212 --> 00:04:02.432
because we all have to coexist and do business together.

00:04:03.272 --> 00:04:08.882
Anything that isn't understood universally is typically considered slang or informal speech.

00:04:09.642 --> 00:04:10.347
I'm cool with that.

00:04:11.187 --> 00:04:14.457
I understand why, you know, we use the term 'slang.'

00:04:14.787 --> 00:04:18.657
I understand that the reason I don't appreciate the word 'slang' is pretty irrational.

00:04:19.467 --> 00:04:22.317
I guess it's just a cultural thing that's really hard to explain.

00:04:23.007 --> 00:04:26.187
And it took me a long time to write this essay because I know how I feel,

00:04:26.667 --> 00:04:28.707
but I don't know exactly what I think.

00:04:29.607 --> 00:04:32.827
In some way, I'm trying to discover what I think by writing this essay.

00:04:32.907 --> 00:04:35.982
I'm going to make a separate episode about this topic,

00:04:35.982 --> 00:04:42.072
because there's all a lot of history and culture that you need to be aware of if you really want to understand what I mean.

00:04:42.402 --> 00:04:43.602
So to summarize my point,

00:04:43.872 --> 00:04:47.682
I don't really like the word 'slang' because of its cultural connotation.

00:04:48.522 --> 00:04:53.652
Most of the time, at least in the U.S., slang refers to the way some black people speak.

00:04:54.162 --> 00:04:55.782
It refers to 'nigga talk.'

00:04:56.947 --> 00:05:00.277
But, like I said, I'll talk much more about that in a future episode.

00:05:00.847 --> 00:05:04.897
So now, let's talk about why it's so difficult to teach you slang correctly.

00:05:05.827 --> 00:05:06.377
The U.S.

00:05:06.397 --> 00:05:08.617
is a gigantic country.

00:05:09.487 --> 00:05:11.737
We have many different cultures and ethnicities here,

00:05:11.737 --> 00:05:13.567
and we all have our own ways of communicating.

00:05:14.287 --> 00:05:19.807
What that means is we have different words and expressions that are only used in certain regions of the country.

00:05:19.957 --> 00:05:24.257
And in those regions, the words and expressions are only used by certain groups of people.

00:05:25.377 --> 00:05:30.072
The things we say here in the South are different from the things they say up North or on the West Coast.

00:05:30.372 --> 00:05:34.632
And not only that, but there are certain things that only certain groups of people say

00:05:34.632 --> 00:05:37.722
in the South, the North, the West and the Midwest,

00:05:38.502 --> 00:05:39.972
there are some things that are universal,

00:05:40.242 --> 00:05:42.522
but there are many things that simply are not.

00:05:43.182 --> 00:05:48.622
So I don't believe that it would be helpful for me to teach you individual slang words or expressions without context.

00:05:49.532 --> 00:05:54.352
Words without context don't have much meaning or they can have multiple meanings.

00:05:55.012 --> 00:05:58.552
And to give you context, I would have to explain the cultural dynamics of a region,

00:05:58.852 --> 00:06:02.722
city, and or neighborhood for you to truly understand the meaning of the word,

00:06:03.142 --> 00:06:07.132
how is used, when it's used, who uses it and why.

00:06:08.302 --> 00:06:10.432
The fact of the matter is the U.S.

00:06:10.582 --> 00:06:11.992
is different from many other countries

00:06:11.992 --> 00:06:14.922
in the sense that we don't all belong to the same ethnicity.

00:06:15.852 --> 00:06:20.172
We have people of African, Latin, Asian, and European descent here.

00:06:21.012 --> 00:06:24.132
These groups of people were systematically segregated for many years,

00:06:24.372 --> 00:06:26.742
and in some ways they still are very segregated.

00:06:27.552 --> 00:06:33.352
And one of the results of this segregation was the creation and the evolution of multiple American cultures.

00:06:34.422 --> 00:06:37.452
This is something that people don't consider when they asked me to teach them slang.

00:06:38.052 --> 00:06:41.112
So my question to them is always, "Slang from where?

00:06:42.132 --> 00:06:43.362
Slang from which culture?

00:06:43.692 --> 00:06:44.542
Which dialect?"

00:06:45.672 --> 00:06:46.812
America is a big country.

00:06:46.812 --> 00:06:49.422
And although we all understand each other, for the most part,

00:06:49.662 --> 00:06:51.852
we don't all speak and interact in the same way.

00:06:53.052 --> 00:06:57.252
And the other challenge is teaching you slang is helping you sound natural when you use it.

00:06:58.182 --> 00:07:01.062
There are many people who understand slang perfectly fine,

00:07:01.392 --> 00:07:04.572
but when they try to use it, they end up sounding really unnatural,

00:07:04.722 --> 00:07:07.812
which kind of defeats the purpose of using slang in the first place.

00:07:08.862 --> 00:07:14.362
A lot of people don't really understand that it's not just what you say, but it's how you say it.

00:07:15.562 --> 00:07:19.927
So you can learn all the slang in the world and still not sound anything like a native speaker,

00:07:20.107 --> 00:07:23.767
because you haven't learned how to talk, you've just learned what to say.

00:07:25.207 --> 00:07:27.697
That's one of the reasons I tell people that as cool to learn slang

00:07:27.697 --> 00:07:30.817
because it'll help you understand natives more when we're speaking.

00:07:31.267 --> 00:07:33.817
However, you don't really need to learn how to use slang,

00:07:34.147 --> 00:07:36.907
at least, not while you're at a beginner or intermediate level.

00:07:37.357 --> 00:07:40.997
And I say that because it's really hard to sound natural, just speaking basic English.

00:07:41.577 --> 00:07:46.857
So trying to add slang to your speech when you haven't even mastered the basics just slows you down.

00:07:48.057 --> 00:07:53.627
So just remember that it's important to learn slang and informal expressions because you will hear them all the time in the U.S.

00:07:53.907 --> 00:07:58.707
but you should also remember that culture influences all languages.

00:07:59.277 --> 00:08:03.087
So if you're going to learn slang, make sure you understand the culture behind it.

00:08:03.957 --> 00:08:08.641
This will give you a richer understanding of the language and the people who use it to communicate.

00:08:09.827 --> 00:08:10.379
Peace.

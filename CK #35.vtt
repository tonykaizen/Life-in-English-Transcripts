00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:04.230
So your life will always move in the direction of your strongest thought.

2
00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:10.620
Realest shit I ever heard. Your life will always move in the direction of your strongest thought.

3
00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:18.760
If you're thinking is bullshit, if you're thinking is robbing, stealing, cheating, lying,

4
00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:23.680
Just living with the status quo, then that's the way your life will move.

5
00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:31.030
But if you're thinking, your strongest thought is building, reinventing yourself,

6
00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:37.110
Establishing family and businesses in a peaceful state of mind,

7
00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:40.250
Then that's the way your life will move.

8
00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:43.520
Your life will always move in the direction of your strongest thought.

9
00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:46.790
Stay grinding. Stay focused.

10
00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:52.050
Tony Kaizen:
Stay grounded and stay focused, man. And that's the message of the day.

11
00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:57.120
What's up, everybody? This is Coffee with Kaizen number 35. I am your host, Tony Kaizen.

12
00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.630
And the clip you just heard was from a man whose name I don't know,

13
00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:05.410
Because I went on his profiles, his TikTok, his YouTube, and his name isn't really posted anywhere.

14
00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:08.010
But if you want to check out more of his content,

15
00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:18.100
You can find him on TikTok or YouTube at almosteverything630. That is almosteverything630.

16
00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:24.830
Now, onto the point of the episode, the actual meat and potatoes, the real substance.

17
00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:28.560
The message here is to be very careful what you think about.

18
00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:34.990
Because your thoughts will lead you into a particular direction.

19
00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:40.660
Your thoughts are literally creating your future because you think about something and then you do something.

20
00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:47.230
So whatever you're thinking about naturally is gonna manifest itself in your actions and in your life experience.

21
00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:48.640
At least that's what I believe.

22
00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:55.330
And I saw this video two or three weeks ago on TikTok, and I saw it at the perfect time.

23
00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:57.650
It's really amazing how so many times, man,

24
00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:04.240
I'll be thinking about something for a few days and then a video related to that thing pops up on my TikTok feed.

25
00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:05.700
It's really, really, really strange.

26
00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:12.030
But like I said, I saw this video at the right time because actually, let me say it this way.

27
00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:16.890
I'm going to give you an example so that you can really understand the message of this clip

28
00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:21.510
And hopefully, apply the lesson to your own life and see some good results.

29
00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:26.310
I'm trying to work on this new project or start this new project for Life in English,

30
00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:30.870
And I really think it's going to be helpful for you guys and anybody else around the world learning English.

31
00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:33.170
And it's a video project that we're going to put on YouTube.

32
00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:40.420
The problem, though, is that I don't want to do it by myself. I technically could,

33
00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:44.610
But it would be so much harder for so many reasons and I'll get into the project

34
00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:47.080
And what it is and all that type of stuff in a different episode.

35
00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:49.370
But I still want to use this project as an example.

36
00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:55.120
So I really want to realize this project and I technically could do it alone but don't want to.

37
00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:59.850
So I've been stressing for a couple of weeks now,

38
00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:03.500
Trying to figure out how I'm going to get all the things I need to do this project.

39
00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:07.230
And I saw this video and this man is saying, like,

40
00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:09.260
Your life will move in the direction of your strongest thought.

41
00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:15.700
And I've heard that idea said many different ways after reading many books, listening to many podcasts, and watching many videos.

42
00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:18.370
So I understand the concept and I believe in it.

43
00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:25.950
So after I watched that video, it was just like a nice little reminder to stay focused on exactly what I want and nothing more.

44
00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:30.000
So after I watched it for like a week, maybe two weeks,

45
00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:35.180
All I was thinking about was, Man, I need a cameraman. I need a cameraman for this project.

46
00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:38.180
I need a cameraman. How the fuck am I going to find a cameraman?

47
00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:41.730
Because I didn't, I don't have any friends that can help me with it.

48
00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:47.580
And I don't really know any other creatives or professionals that can help me with this project.

49
00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:50.790
So I'm kind of like stuck, you know? Or I was at least.

50
00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:54.740
But just by focusing on what I really needed and what I wanted,

51
00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:58.480
Which was a cameraman to work on this project, I started to ask myself,

52
00:03:58.480 --> 00:03:59.830
How would I find this person?

53
00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:05.240
Instead of focusing on what I don't have and focusing on the negativity like,

54
00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:10.120
Shit, I don't have this person. I can't do this project. I don't have this. I can't do that.

55
00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:13.950
Instead of thinking that way, I started to ask myself, Well, how could I do it?

56
00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:17.860
What needs to happen for me to get this thing that I need?

57
00:04:18.230 --> 00:04:22.420
And just by asking myself that question, my brain automatically starts trying to find the answer.

58
00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:26.010
And I'm just focused on this one thing, this one thing.

59
00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:28.990
I need this specifically. I want this specifically.

60
00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:33.030
Just by focusing on that with every minute of free time that I have,

61
00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:40.130
I started to experiment and find ways to find this person I'm looking for. You see what I'm saying?

62
00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:42.620
So I'm putting job postings on different websites.

63
00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:47.950
You know, I'm looking on Instagram trying to find people in my city that do the type of work I'm looking for.

64
00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:53.080
Looking in all these different places. And not even a day later,

65
00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:56.010
After doing all those job postings, I'm starting to get applications,

66
00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:58.510
People that want to help me work on this project. You see what I'm saying?

67
00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:02.430
And I wouldn't have been able to do that if I hadn't been focused on the right thing,

68
00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:07.240
Which was finding this thing that I need to work on this project that I want to realize. You know?

69
00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:13.500
And so now we've luckily found a couple of cameramen and we can get started very soon, actually.

70
00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:16.560
And maybe that's not the best example, but hopefully, you get the point.

71
00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:20.000
Is I was just so hyper-focused on finding this one thing that I needed,

72
00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:25.270
That my brain just naturally starts looking for ways to get it because that's what I was focused on.

73
00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:33.800
Since that's what I was focused on my actions or the intention of my actions was to find that thing and through my actions,

74
00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:36.560
I brought that thing into my reality. Hopefully, that makes sense.

75
00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:39.550
And it wasn't just the cameraman like,

76
00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:43.060
This project that we're trying to work on involved a lot of thinking, a lot of planning.

77
00:05:43.690 --> 00:05:46.890
You know, financial plans, because I need to hire employees to work on this project.

78
00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:50.050
The aesthetic, the branding, how we're going to share the project with people.

79
00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:52.790
What's the real value of this project?

80
00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:55.580
How are we going to put it on the platforms, the editing style?

81
00:05:55.710 --> 00:06:00.000
Like, how are we going to go above and beyond all the other people doing similar things?

82
00:06:00.190 --> 00:06:02.780
How are we going to do it in a unique way, you know?

83
00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:08.290
All these different questions are running through my head when thinking about this project.

84
00:06:08.290 --> 00:06:11.570
But the point is I'm thinking about it. It's what I want to do the most.

85
00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:14.830
So that's what I'm focused on. And slowly but surely,

86
00:06:15.550 --> 00:06:18.470
Just start getting exposed to little bits of information or people

87
00:06:18.470 --> 00:06:22.050
Or ideas that help me better prepare for this project we're trying to work on.

88
00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:27.030
If I was focused on the negativity and all the things we don't have or couldn't do

89
00:06:27.030 --> 00:06:30.460
Or the difficulties and this and that, then I would just be stuck there.

90
00:06:30.460 --> 00:06:38.400
But since I'm focused on what I want, which is progress, moving forward, making shit happen, that's what happens.

91
00:06:40.870 --> 00:06:44.930
So like the man was saying in the clip, if you're focused on negativity, being sneaky,

92
00:06:44.930 --> 00:06:49.730
Hiding things, like being manipulative, being lazy and procrastinating,

93
00:06:49.730 --> 00:06:53.940
Thinking about all the reasons you can't do something or all the reasons that this thing won't work,

94
00:06:54.760 --> 00:06:55.990
That's the life experience you're going to have.

95
00:06:55.990 --> 00:07:02.780
But if you focus on positivity, you know, bettering yourself, looking for better friends and relationships,

96
00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:09.300
Being more productive, learning this new skill like English or learning how to start a business or whatever it is,

97
00:07:09.530 --> 00:07:13.500
Whatever it is that you truly want, if you're focused on that, you're going to get it.

98
00:07:15.410 --> 00:07:18.040
Obviously, you have to put in the work, but it starts with the thought process.

99
00:07:18.040 --> 00:07:22.180
It starts with the mentality. That's what's important. You know?

100
00:07:23.540 --> 00:07:27.550
So being very careful about the thoughts you choose to maintain

101
00:07:27.550 --> 00:07:34.840
And focus on is extremely important for so many reasons, man. For so many reasons.

102
00:07:34.840 --> 00:07:37.800
You have to make sure you're thinking about things the right way if you have

103
00:07:38.190 --> 00:07:41.350
Or if you hope to have any chance of them actually happening. You know what I'm saying?

104
00:07:43.180 --> 00:07:46.680
Now, one thing that's dangerous, though, is thinking too much. Right?

105
00:07:46.680 --> 00:07:48.620
Because still using this project as the example,

106
00:07:49.470 --> 00:07:55.080
What I noticed is that you can get a lot of pleasure from just thinking about doing something.

107
00:07:57.460 --> 00:08:01.490
It could be a big project, learning a new language, starting a business, whatever it is,

108
00:08:01.770 --> 00:08:08.810
Just by thinking about doing it, just by making plans to do it you feel like you're actually getting something done.

109
00:08:10.230 --> 00:08:13.320
Because when we're planning this new project, this big thing, it's super exciting.

110
00:08:13.320 --> 00:08:14.740
We know it's going to help a lot of people.

111
00:08:14.740 --> 00:08:18.070
We know it's going to be a lot of fun making it or doing it in this case.

112
00:08:19.540 --> 00:08:23.410
You get this rush of dopamine, right? Because the way I understand it,

113
00:08:23.410 --> 00:08:25.590
Dopamine is like the reward system for the brain.

114
00:08:25.590 --> 00:08:29.060
We do something good or fulfilling and we feel that dopamine,

115
00:08:29.060 --> 00:08:34.470
Which is the reward, that great feeling you get from accomplishing something. We're doing something awesome.

116
00:08:35.910 --> 00:08:41.280
So when we're doing these... Or excuse me, when we're making these plans the financial plans,

117
00:08:41.280 --> 00:08:45.220
The marketing plans, the content plans, the editing, buying the equipment, you know,

118
00:08:45.220 --> 00:08:49.960
Looking for the cameramen, all these things that we need to bring the project together, you know, bringing or...

119
00:08:51.200 --> 00:08:53.660
Yeah, bringing together the, all the pieces of the vision.

120
00:08:55.820 --> 00:08:57.830
I'm feeling all these, these rushes of dopamine.

121
00:08:57.830 --> 00:09:00.820
I'm feeling super inspired, super excited to work on this thing.

122
00:09:02.440 --> 00:09:07.220
But the problem is I noticed when we get to the point where it's like, actually time to do the work,

123
00:09:07.220 --> 00:09:12.000
To go to this place and work on this project, I don't really feel like it anymore.

124
00:09:13.760 --> 00:09:22.150
Because I've already gotten all the dopamine, all the psychological rewards, let's say, of planning the project.

125
00:09:22.150 --> 00:09:24.850
Saying, we're going to do this, we're going to do that. Yeah, it's going to be fucking awesome.

126
00:09:24.850 --> 00:09:27.980
We got this, this, this. Bam, bam, bam, we got the plan. Blah, blah, blah.

127
00:09:28.920 --> 00:09:33.360
It feels amazing. You feel super inspired and ready to just fucking conquer the world,

128
00:09:34.070 --> 00:09:38.050
But when it comes time to actually do it, you've already gotten the reward as if you have done it.

129
00:09:38.050 --> 00:09:41.240
So there's no reason to do it. You see what I'm saying?

130
00:09:41.240 --> 00:09:46.190
You spent so much time thinking about doing it. You got the reward.

131
00:09:47.580 --> 00:09:53.910
But now it's time to do it. And you're like, I don't know. Maybe later.

132
00:09:54.860 --> 00:09:57.740
Maybe we need to do some more planning. I need to do some more research.

133
00:09:57.740 --> 00:09:58.800
I need to do some more thinking.

134
00:09:58.800 --> 00:10:02.950
And you just get stuck in that place. Very dangerous.

135
00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:07.330
So I agree 100% with what this man is saying is your life will move in the direction of your strongest thought.

136
00:10:07.800 --> 00:10:11.790
But what I would caution you to do is be very careful about how long you think.

137
00:10:13.970 --> 00:10:18.690
And it's really, it's really hard to figure out what that amount of time should be because it's all subjective,

138
00:10:19.490 --> 00:10:21.240
Because you do need to think before you act.

139
00:10:21.240 --> 00:10:25.460
You do need to make a plan if you have any hope of actually realizing a project.

140
00:10:25.980 --> 00:10:32.540
However, being careful about how long you think about these things is extremely important.

141
00:10:32.540 --> 00:10:36.500
Because you don't want to get stuck in that place where you're just planning all the time,

142
00:10:36.930 --> 00:10:42.230
Compulsively thinking and planning, but never doing. At some point, you have to take action.

143
00:10:43.870 --> 00:10:46.500
So think deeply about your project, your plan, your objective.

144
00:10:46.940 --> 00:10:51.320
Make a plan, and then immediately, as soon as possible just fucking start doing it.

145
00:10:52.030 --> 00:10:55.150
Even if you don't feel ready, even if you think you don't have every single thing you need,

146
00:10:55.560 --> 00:10:58.810
Getting started as soon as possible, in my opinion,

147
00:10:58.930 --> 00:11:07.120
Is the best way to have the highest chance of achieving your goal, whatever that may be.

148
00:11:08.660 --> 00:11:13.160
You don't want to get stuck in that, that place where you're just thinking about shit,

149
00:11:13.290 --> 00:11:14.900
Feeling a bunch of dopamine because you think...

150
00:11:14.900 --> 00:11:20.600
Because you spend the same amount of mental energy thinking about something that you do actually doing something,

151
00:11:21.710 --> 00:11:24.190
Which is why it's kind of fucked up because you spend so much energy

152
00:11:24.730 --> 00:11:29.060
And you get so much dopamine from just thinking about realizing this project that when it comes time to do it,

153
00:11:29.060 --> 00:11:33.720
You have no, no, let's say, inspiration. You don't feel like doing it.

154
00:11:38.110 --> 00:11:43.710
And I found myself there recently, kind of just thinking about doing the actual project and it's like...

155
00:11:45.540 --> 00:11:48.010
Just don't feel not motivation because I have a reason to do it,

156
00:11:48.010 --> 00:11:50.320
But feel no inspiration to actually get up and go do it.

157
00:11:52.660 --> 00:11:55.340
Hopefully, I'm making sense here. I feel like I'm being redundant at this point,

158
00:11:56.100 --> 00:12:01.780
But it's just something I wish I would have learned sooner and something that I feel a lot of people don't talk about enough.

159
00:12:03.130 --> 00:12:05.120
Because you do need to focus on what you want.

160
00:12:05.120 --> 00:12:09.910
You do need to think about it and make a plan. But then you take action.

161
00:12:10.440 --> 00:12:14.000
That's the next step. You need to do that as soon as possible. You know what I mean?

162
00:12:16.040 --> 00:12:23.910
So, I guess now is a good time. I want to play one more clip from a different person,

163
00:12:24.160 --> 00:12:30.390
From a legendary rapper from right here in Atlanta, Georgia, named Gucci Mane.

164
00:12:30.390 --> 00:12:36.410
G U C C I, Gucci. Mane, M A N E. Gucci Mane.

165
00:12:37.610 --> 00:12:41.720
And I got this clip from an interview he did. And he's talking about the same subject,

166
00:12:41.720 --> 00:12:44.430
The importance of your thought process and what you think about. Ok?

167
00:12:44.430 --> 00:12:46.680
So I'm going to play that clip now and then we'll continue.

168
00:12:49.440 --> 00:12:51.680
Gucci Mane:
Watch what you think about. You are your thoughts.

169
00:12:52.060 --> 00:12:56.260
You know, if you just like, nobody can, nobody's in your head, be self-aware.

170
00:12:56.490 --> 00:12:59.460
If you're really self-aware and really responsible in your head, man,

171
00:12:59.460 --> 00:13:01.420
If you hold yourself accountable, everybody going to see it.

172
00:13:01.420 --> 00:13:03.440
You ain't got to say nothing. You come and tell me,

173
00:13:03.740 --> 00:13:05.970
"Bro, I finna change my life. I finna start losing weight."

174
00:13:06.400 --> 00:13:09.560
The first time I'm excited for him. The second time I'm encouraging.

175
00:13:09.680 --> 00:13:12.680
The third time, don't tell me no more. Because now you just cap.

176
00:13:12.960 --> 00:13:14.090
The more you keep saying you got...

177
00:13:14.140 --> 00:13:17.140
But if you just, if you told me one time, then I seen you slimmer.

178
00:13:17.140 --> 00:13:21.000
And then you tell me another time, "Hey, I don't want to go to dinner. I'm good."

179
00:13:21.750 --> 00:13:23.080
You ain't got to say nothing. Now I see it.

180
00:13:23.230 --> 00:13:24.950
You get what I'm saying? So that's the whole thing.

181
00:13:24.950 --> 00:13:32.660
Tony Kaizen:
All right. The first thing I want to say is don't feel bad if you couldn't understand everything that he was saying,

182
00:13:32.660 --> 00:13:38.230
Because he does have like a pretty strong Atlanta accent, you know, that Southern accent.

183
00:13:38.230 --> 00:13:43.250
And he was speaking a little bit fast and, you know, he was kind of speaking Ebonics.

184
00:13:43.250 --> 00:13:44.810
It wasn't like standard English at times,

185
00:13:44.810 --> 00:13:47.290
So don't feel bad if you couldn't understand everything and remember it,

186
00:13:47.400 --> 00:13:50.730
Just read the transcript and you'll get all the explanations you need.

187
00:13:50.730 --> 00:13:53.350
And if you do have more questions, just hit me up on Discord. All right?

188
00:13:54.290 --> 00:13:58.820
But back to what he was saying. You need to really be careful about your thoughts.

189
00:13:58.820 --> 00:14:00.190
You need to watch what you think about.

190
00:14:00.870 --> 00:14:03.740
I don't necessarily agree with the idea that you are your thoughts,

191
00:14:04.540 --> 00:14:08.990
Because thoughts are just thoughts. We don't really know where they come from.

192
00:14:10.850 --> 00:14:15.220
Sometimes you think without trying to think and I don't know if it's clear,

193
00:14:15.400 --> 00:14:19.530
I don't know if it's certain that those thoughts are you.

194
00:14:20.350 --> 00:14:25.850
I think you are the actions you take, not the thoughts that you have. Right?

195
00:14:25.940 --> 00:14:29.220
Because a lot of us think about a lot of crazy shit, a lot of dark shit.

196
00:14:29.940 --> 00:14:33.310
It doesn't mean that we do those things. You see what I'm saying?

197
00:14:33.310 --> 00:14:35.700
Thoughts are potential. I think actions are real.

198
00:14:37.690 --> 00:14:42.710
But anyway, the point is still the same. You need to be very careful about your thoughts.

199
00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:47.460
Because your thoughts will lead you in a particular direction,

200
00:14:47.460 --> 00:14:50.160
Whether you like it or not. You see what I'm saying?

201
00:14:50.160 --> 00:14:51.980
And going back to what Gucci Mane was saying,

202
00:14:54.970 --> 00:14:59.120
what I would recommend you to do is stop talking about the shit you're going to do.

203
00:15:01.260 --> 00:15:03.060
And this goes back to the point I was trying to make earlier.

204
00:15:03.060 --> 00:15:08.010
Because you get that same hit of dopamine, you get the same feeling of accomplishment,

205
00:15:08.600 --> 00:15:12.620
The reward, you still get that just by saying you're going to do something.

206
00:15:12.620 --> 00:15:14.680
If you keep telling everybody, I'm going to learn English,

207
00:15:14.940 --> 00:15:16.700
I'm going to learn English, I'm going to learn English.

208
00:15:17.200 --> 00:15:20.930
Every time you do that, you get a hit of dopamine and you feel like you've accomplished something.

209
00:15:22.350 --> 00:15:26.100
And everybody says, Oh, that's great, man. Good for you. Congratulations. Good luck, blah, blah, blah.

210
00:15:27.460 --> 00:15:34.170
You feel good about it. But then you have no reason to do it because you've already gotten the reward for just talking about it.

211
00:15:35.980 --> 00:15:41.120
But then after just talking about it comes the real hard part, which is actually doing it, you see?

212
00:15:41.120 --> 00:15:45.650
And since you've already gotten the reward for doing it, why would you then go and actually do it?

213
00:15:46.580 --> 00:15:48.120
You wouldn't, and most people never do.

214
00:15:49.190 --> 00:15:52.540
Because most people just talk and talk and talk about what they're going to do.

215
00:15:53.760 --> 00:15:57.010
And hardly ever about what they've done. You see what I'm saying?

216
00:15:59.520 --> 00:16:02.570
So like Gucci Mane was saying, let's use losing weight as an example.

217
00:16:02.570 --> 00:16:05.350
You say, "I'm going to change my life and lose all this weight. I'm going to be healthier".

218
00:16:05.680 --> 00:16:10.140
You're telling everybody that and it feels amazing. Everybody's like, Go for it, man. Congratulations.

219
00:16:10.140 --> 00:16:13.380
That's important. We all want to see you do better, blah, blah, blah. You feel amazing.

220
00:16:15.070 --> 00:16:20.560
But then you keep eating fucking fast food and you keep sitting on the couch all day and smoking cigarettes, whatever it is.

221
00:16:21.380 --> 00:16:26.660
Because there's no reason to actually change now that you told everybody you're going to change and everybody congratulated you for it.

222
00:16:26.660 --> 00:16:28.460
You got the reward.

223
00:16:29.780 --> 00:16:32.210
But instead of talking about it, if you just did it.

224
00:16:33.290 --> 00:16:39.070
And then people start to notice the results and compliment you and say, Damn, man, you're getting slimmer.

225
00:16:39.070 --> 00:16:40.760
You're losing weight. What are you doing different?

226
00:16:41.480 --> 00:16:46.430
Then you start to get the reward for the actions you've already taken. You understand?

227
00:16:46.490 --> 00:16:48.030
By that time you've built up momentum.

228
00:16:48.030 --> 00:16:51.250
You're already in the process of doing this thing or making this change.

229
00:16:51.480 --> 00:16:54.850
So when people notice or start talking about it, you're already on the path to success.

230
00:16:54.850 --> 00:16:55.490
You're already there.

231
00:16:57.570 --> 00:17:01.080
So any feeling of dopamine that you get from people's comments

232
00:17:01.080 --> 00:17:09.940
Or being able to show people that you're doing the thing instead of just talking about it, it's like a bonus. You understand?

233
00:17:11.600 --> 00:17:17.040
You don't fucking get to eat your fucking dessert first. Not if you want to be successful.

234
00:17:17.390 --> 00:17:23.270
It's meat, fucking vegetables, the main dish, the real meal, and then dessert.

235
00:17:24.120 --> 00:17:27.770
Then you get cookies and ice cream and cake and all that, that fun shit that tastes amazing.

236
00:17:27.770 --> 00:17:32.820
You understand? Business first, then we play. Work first, then we play.

237
00:17:34.950 --> 00:17:38.910
We do it and then we show it and then we talk about it. You understand?

238
00:17:38.910 --> 00:17:42.300
To me, it's a much better way to go about doing things,

239
00:17:43.070 --> 00:17:46.450
Which is why I haven't really talked too much about this new project I want to work on,

240
00:17:46.450 --> 00:17:50.110
Because I know the more I talk about it, the lower the chance that I actually do it.

241
00:17:50.490 --> 00:17:54.980
I would much rather just get started, work on it, see if it's even going to work,

242
00:17:55.780 --> 00:18:00.120
Get some results, get some traction, get some momentum and then tell you about it.

243
00:18:00.640 --> 00:18:04.000
Look at this cool thing we're doing, not this cool thing we're going to do.

244
00:18:06.330 --> 00:18:09.920
And there's so many reasons to do that because there's also the chance when you go around telling everybody,

245
00:18:09.920 --> 00:18:14.480
I'm going to do this, I'm going to do this, I'm going to do this, and then you don't do it.

246
00:18:15.480 --> 00:18:16.560
Now you look like a fucking idiot.

247
00:18:16.560 --> 00:18:18.690
Everybody's like, Oh, he's just capping, just talking.

248
00:18:19.650 --> 00:18:21.650
And that's your reputation now. That's how people know you,

249
00:18:21.650 --> 00:18:24.930
Because you chose to just talk, talk, talk, talk, talk. Then you never did it.

250
00:18:25.400 --> 00:18:28.450
So now the next time you talk, talk, talk, talk, talk, nobody's going to believe you.

251
00:18:30.840 --> 00:18:32.380
You went back on your word, you know?

252
00:18:32.380 --> 00:18:35.590
So it's better to just do shit and then tell people you've done it.

253
00:18:37.230 --> 00:18:39.980
Because then you don't need to say anything. You know what I'm saying?

254
00:18:40.740 --> 00:18:48.790
You speak with your actions. And to me, that's a much better way of going about achieving goals in life.

255
00:18:48.790 --> 00:18:52.290
You just do the shit. Think to yourself, make a plan,

256
00:18:52.290 --> 00:18:57.520
Tell whoever is involved in realizing that plan, and then just go do the shit.

257
00:18:57.590 --> 00:19:01.610
Then you show everybody what I've done, not what I'm going to do.

258
00:19:01.680 --> 00:19:04.430
Everybody is going to do something, eventually.

259
00:19:04.430 --> 00:19:07.100
It could be tomorrow. It could be next week. It could be next year.

260
00:19:07.520 --> 00:19:12.510
But you are doing shit. Because you understand there's no time to waste.

261
00:19:12.510 --> 00:19:18.430
You understand that we don't just talk about it, like most people, right?

262
00:19:18.650 --> 00:19:23.470
We have this phrase or this expression where I'm from, we say, "Don't talk about it, be about it".

263
00:19:25.280 --> 00:19:29.820
And what that means is don't just tell everybody this is my lifestyle, this is what I'm about, this is who I am.

264
00:19:29.820 --> 00:19:32.820
You show people. You don't need to say anything,

265
00:19:32.820 --> 00:19:39.660
Just like Gucci Mane was saying in the video or the clip if you just start going to the gym and eating better and start losing weight,

266
00:19:39.660 --> 00:19:43.330
People are going to notice. I see you're achieving your goal.

267
00:19:43.330 --> 00:19:44.400
You don't have to tell me anything.

268
00:19:46.510 --> 00:19:50.110
I think a lot of us have just formed this bad habit, especially these days,

269
00:19:50.110 --> 00:19:53.080
Where we can share our entire lives on the Internet if we really want to.

270
00:19:53.870 --> 00:19:58.070
We're telling everybody what we're going to do. We're just talking because things sound good.

271
00:19:59.540 --> 00:20:02.670
But actually doing the shit is something different, you know?

272
00:20:04.400 --> 00:20:06.810
So I don't want to ramble or be too redundant.

273
00:20:06.810 --> 00:20:11.550
So I'm going to end this in summary by saying... Or excuse me,

274
00:20:11.570 --> 00:20:18.080
I think a better way to say that is I'm going to summarize by saying you really need to pay attention to what you're thinking about.

275
00:20:20.200 --> 00:20:22.790
Because your life will move in the direction of your strongest thought.

276
00:20:22.790 --> 00:20:25.980
And when I say "strongest thought", I mean whatever you think about the most.

277
00:20:27.200 --> 00:20:31.600
Whatever thoughts or ideas you maintain at the forefront of your mind.

278
00:20:34.220 --> 00:20:35.780
That's the direction in which your life will go.

279
00:20:36.550 --> 00:20:40.730
And the good and the bad news is you get to make that choice every second of every day.

280
00:20:41.070 --> 00:20:44.690
What are you going to think about? What are you choosing to focus on?

281
00:20:47.870 --> 00:20:50.810
I cannot stress enough how important this idea is, bro.

282
00:20:52.720 --> 00:20:59.690
Watch what you think about. And if you want better, then choose to think better.

283
00:21:00.410 --> 00:21:03.980
If you don't really give a fuck, then shut off this podcast, ignore everything I'm saying.

284
00:21:03.980 --> 00:21:08.910
But I know, I'm almost certain, let's say, that you want better for yourself.

285
00:21:10.100 --> 00:21:13.280
You need to know if that's what you want, then you need to think better for yourself.

286
00:21:14.770 --> 00:21:21.050
Plan better and then take action. Do not get stuck in the thinking or planning phase.

287
00:21:22.070 --> 00:21:25.830
That infinite feedback loop where you're constantly patting yourself on the back saying,

288
00:21:25.830 --> 00:21:32.220
Yeah, I'm going to do this thing, it's going to be awesome. And then you never do it, right?

289
00:21:34.140 --> 00:21:39.100
This is my recommendation to you, man. Be very careful about your thought process.

290
00:21:39.170 --> 00:21:41.040
Pay very close attention to what you're thinking about.

291
00:21:41.870 --> 00:21:49.450
And remember, until you take action, all those thoughts and words mean nothing. You know what I'm saying?

292
00:21:50.430 --> 00:21:52.850
Don't talk about it, be about it.

293
00:21:52.850 --> 00:21:59.070
This is Coffee with Kaizen number 35, my friends.

294
00:21:59.210 --> 00:22:01.740
Hopefully, you enjoyed the episode and got some cool things to think about.

295
00:22:01.740 --> 00:22:06.520
I'd love to start a conversation about this subject on Discord. So hit me up, man.

296
00:22:06.520 --> 00:22:09.160
Once you listen to the episode, tell me what you think. All right?

297
00:22:09.160 --> 00:22:10.290
But that's it for now, my friend.

298
00:22:11.280 --> 00:22:14.070

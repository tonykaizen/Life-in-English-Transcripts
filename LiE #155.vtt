00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:06.190
What's up, my friend? Thank you so much for taking the time
to listen to the Life in English podcast. I'm your host,

2
00:00:06.190 --> 00:00:13.540
your spiritual guide, your sensei, Tony Kaizen, and I've got
a great episode for English learners and teachers alike,

3
00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:19.110
because after teaching English online for the past five
years, I've noticed a few things that students and teachers

4
00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:25.860
can do to make their classes more productive and enjoyable.
And those things are what I'm gonna share with you in this

5
00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:36.320
episode. Alright, my friend, let's start with the English
learners.

6
00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:42.250
Here are some things in no particular order that you should
do if you want to get the most value out of your English

7
00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:50.670
classes. So before you have the class, before you start, one
thing I recommend you do is set clear and detailed goals for

8
00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:58.680
yourself. Because if you don't have a destination, you will
never arrive anywhere. You might be moving and expending

9
00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:03.650
energy, but if you're not moving in the right direction,
then you're not making progress. In fact, you're doing the

10
00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:10.430
exact opposite, right? And if you haven't chosen a
destination or a goal for yourself, there's no way of

11
00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:17.360
knowing if you're moving in the right direction. So you must
determine what goal you're trying to reach. Be as specific

12
00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:25.650
as possible. Your teacher is gonna need to know exactly what
your goal is if they're going to help you achieve it. So

13
00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:33.730
think about why you are learning English. "I'm learning
English for my career" is not an answer. When I ask you why,

14
00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:41.710
I want you to tell me what truly motivates you to achieve
this goal specifically. Are you trying to qualify for a

15
00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:47.580
better job so you can support your family better? Are you
trying to get a visa for some exchange program? Did you

16
00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:52.470
recently fail an interview because you couldn't speak
English well enough to do the job? Is it a lack of

17
00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:59.010
vocabulary that's the problem? Or is it something more
psychological, like anxiety or stress? Did you recently move

18
00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:04.330
to the US with children who will be learning in an
English-speaking school? Do you want to learn English to be

19
00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:10.470
able to be involved in their academic career? Do you want to
be able to volunteer at their school? You see what I'm

20
00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:17.940
saying? What will you use the language for? Which areas do
you struggle with the most? Are you willing to study every

21
00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:26.070
single day? Do you have that capability or availability? You
see what I'm saying? Also, you need to think about what kind

22
00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:32.630
of teacher you want cos there are tons, literally tons of
talented teachers out there who are more than qualified to

23
00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:41.000
teach you the English language. However, each teacher has a
different methodology, personality, accent, presence, sense

24
00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:47.670
of humor, and price. But please do not let their price be
the only factor you consider when choosing a teacher. That

25
00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:57.060
is a terrible strategy. Okay? The right goal with the wrong
teacher can be a recipe for disaster, in my experience. So

26
00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:02.910
here are some questions you should consider when thinking
about what kind of teacher you want. Do you want a teacher

27
00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:10.610
from the US or maybe Australia or England? Do you want a
teacher that specializes mainly in conversation or mainly in

28
00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:18.710
grammar and writing skills? Do you prefer a male or a female
teacher? Would you like them to have a particular accent? Do

29
00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:26.320
you respond better to lively, energetic teachers or soft
spoken and calming teachers? Do you want someone who has a

30
00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:31.750
particular set of interests? Do you need a teacher who also
speaks your native language? Do you need a teacher who

31
00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:38.780
charges a certain amount of money per class? Having the
answers to these questions will make it a lot easier to find

32
00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:45.290
and choose the right teacher for you. You'll save tons of
time and money by not having to experiment with a bunch of

33
00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:50.760
teachers who were simply never right for you in the first
place. You'll also save those teachers lots of time, and

34
00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:56.720
that's just as important. But now let's assume you found
your teacher. You're taking classes and you're feeling good,

35
00:03:56.890 --> 00:04:05.110
right? Let me talk to you about a few things you should not
do when you're having classes. The first one. You should not

36
00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:11.000
be pretending that you understand when you clearly do not.
Please stop doing this. You know what I'm talking about.

37
00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:17.020
You're having a conversation. Someone says something you
don't understand. And instead of stopping them and saying,

38
00:04:17.020 --> 00:04:22.240
"Excuse me, what does that mean?" You say, fucking nothing.

39
00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:29.680
Like you pretend to understand what's happening, right? Mm
hmm. Mm hmm.

40
00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:37.770
Yeah. Yeah. And you force yourself to laugh a little bit
because you don't want to make the situation awkward or

41
00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:43.830
uncomfortable. You don't want to ruin the conversation. And
then you sit in silence for a few seconds to see if they're

42
00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:48.120
going to keep talking. Because if they keep talking, then
they don't have to focus on the fact that I didn't

43
00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:54.520
understand what they just said. Right? You know what I'm
talking about. But you're talking to a native speaker, my

44
00:04:54.520 --> 00:05:01.540
friend. You really think they can't see in your face that
you didn't understand what was said? Of course they can. So

45
00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:06.870
what's the point in trying to hide it, bro? There's nothing
wrong with not being able to understand someone's words. It

46
00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:13.490
just means that you need them to be explained to you in a
different way. So if you don't understand, just say that,

47
00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:20.180
because that's the only way someone will know that they need
to teach you something. And that is the only way you will

48
00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:22.220
learn, my friend. Okay?

49
00:05:23.470 --> 00:05:31.020
Something else you need to stop doing is using your teacher
like a dictionary. A lot of y'all are guilty of this as

50
00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:38.370
well. You arrive in class and you do nothing but ask your
teacher to translate phrases, right? "Teacher, teacher, how

51
00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:44.940
do I say, 'aproximadamente'?" "Teacher, how do I say, 'o
saco vazio não para em pé'?" "Teacher, how do I say, 'abre

52
00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:52.630
la puerta'?" Translating everything literally is not only an
unproductive use of time, it's also not the purpose of a

53
00:05:52.630 --> 00:06:00.440
teacher. That's the purpose of a translator, which you can
find online for free. Your teacher's purpose is to explain

54
00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:07.740
what you don't understand about the translation you went and
searched for. Your teacher's purpose is to guide you down

55
00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:15.140
the path, not walk for you. So take the time to practice
English on your own, search for answers to your questions on

56
00:06:15.140 --> 00:06:21.000
your own, and then call on your teacher to see if your
understanding is correct. I suggest you do it this way

57
00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:27.220
because you typically value and remember things you had to
work for much more than the things that were simply given to

58
00:06:27.220 --> 00:06:33.990
you. In other words, you'll learn and internalize things
better that way. Okay?

59
00:06:34.620 --> 00:06:41.640
Another thing you really need to stop doing is waiting until
the day of class to practice your English. You know what I'm

60
00:06:41.640 --> 00:06:49.020
talking about. You know you're doing it, bro. Stop that
shit. Okay? Having one English class per week is much better

61
00:06:49.020 --> 00:06:54.870
than zero classes per week, let me start by saying that, but
if you're not practicing your English during the rest of the

62
00:06:54.870 --> 00:07:01.660
week, one class per week is gonna have little to no effect
on your ability to speak and understand English, or at least

63
00:07:01.660 --> 00:07:10.290
your progress is gonna be painfully slow. You need to be
practicing and learning on your own every day if you really

64
00:07:10.290 --> 00:07:18.500
want to improve rapidly. So you should be consuming content
in English, taking notes and writing down your questions, so

65
00:07:18.500 --> 00:07:23.140
when you get to your weekly class, you can get all your
questions answered and your doubts cleared up by your

66
00:07:23.140 --> 00:07:31.890
teacher. Just imagine if football players only played the
game once a week. Like that would be a terrible thing to do

67
00:07:31.890 --> 00:07:38.030
if they wanted to be champions of the league, right?
Footballers practice multiple times a week to stay in shape

68
00:07:38.290 --> 00:07:44.470
and to get prepared for the game at the weekend. Like
without training....excuse me...without training

69
00:07:44.470 --> 00:07:50.740
consistently, there's no way they could perform at the
highest level every weekend. And it's the same for you.

70
00:07:51.210 --> 00:07:56.370
Without speaking English consistently, there's no way you're
gonna speak it at the highest level when the time calls for

71
00:07:57.880 --> 00:08:05.570
it. Now at this point, if you're taking classes or at least
thinking about taking them, you might have identified with

72
00:08:05.570 --> 00:08:10.190
some things that I've said so far. You might even be
thinking about some other ways you can have better English

73
00:08:10.190 --> 00:08:16.580
classes. But before we continue, I'd like to tell you about

78
00:08:40.980 --> 00:08:48.030
Now I'd like to talk about the teachers. And this one's not
as easy because I...I generally, you know, have no interest

79
00:08:48.070 --> 00:08:53.950
in trying to tell other professionals how to do their job.
You know, every teacher has their own way of doing things,

80
00:08:53.950 --> 00:08:58.790
their own beliefs and methodology. And, you know, just
because I do things a certain way doesn't mean that another

81
00:08:58.790 --> 00:09:04.960
teacher should do them that way. So I'm not necessarily
going to say what a teacher should do or shouldn't do before

82
00:09:04.960 --> 00:09:10.140
they have classes and things like that. But it's it's
actually really similar to a student, like a teacher should

83
00:09:10.140 --> 00:09:15.340
also identify before they start what their goals are, like,
you know, what type of students you want to teach, what

84
00:09:15.340 --> 00:09:21.240
level would you like to work with, you know, adults or
children or a particular gender or people from a particular

85
00:09:21.310 --> 00:09:26.910
country who speak a particular language? How much would you
like to earn per hour, or would you rather do courses

86
00:09:26.910 --> 00:09:32.340
instead of, you know, individual private classes? I think
it's important for any professional to define their goals

87
00:09:32.340 --> 00:09:37.970
before they get started or at least have some idea of where
they're trying to get before they get started, you know, and

88
00:09:37.970 --> 00:09:43.860
what type of students they want to work with or what type of
work they want to do. But apart from that, I can't really

89
00:09:43.860 --> 00:09:50.820
say anything about what teachers should or shouldn't do. All
I know is what I should or shouldn't do, but I will still

90
00:09:51.350 --> 00:09:58.470
make some recommendations on things that all teachers should
stop doing during classes if they truly want to help their

91
00:09:58.470 --> 00:10:04.260
student have a more productive class. But I just want to
emphasize this is just my opinion. But if you're a teacher

92
00:10:04.260 --> 00:10:09.600
listening to this, hit me up and let me know your thoughts.
And if you're a student, send this to your teacher and ask

93
00:10:09.600 --> 00:10:16.370
them to hit me up and let me know about their thoughts. But
anyway, here are some things that teachers should stop doing

94
00:10:16.700 --> 00:10:24.100
in their language classes. The first one is stop jumping in
to rescue your student. Let them struggle through the

95
00:10:24.100 --> 00:10:31.300
sentence until they ask for help. As a teacher, it's natural
to want to help your student in any way you can. So

96
00:10:31.300 --> 00:10:36.590
naturally, when your student gets stuck and you know what
they're trying to say, you just want to give them the phrase

97
00:10:36.590 --> 00:10:42.680
they're looking for. And there isn't necessarily anything
wrong with that. But in my experience, I've noticed that

98
00:10:42.680 --> 00:10:49.150
students tend to learn things more effectively when you let
them arrive at their own conclusions. If your student get

99
00:10:49.150 --> 00:10:54.860
stuck and ask you to translate a word or phrase for them in
their native language, try getting them to describe the idea

100
00:10:55.300 --> 00:11:01.840
of the word or the phrase. If they describe it in a way that
a native speaker would understand, then give them the phrase

101
00:11:01.840 --> 00:11:07.340
they're looking for. But if the explanation doesn't make
enough sense, then ask them to try explaining it in a

102
00:11:07.340 --> 00:11:13.900
different way. Or search on Google for the, the translation.
And once they find the translation, you can tell them if

103
00:11:13.900 --> 00:11:20.720
it's correct, how to use it naturally, how formal it is, and
all those things, right? When you do it this way, you can

104
00:11:20.720 --> 00:11:27.480
help your student without doing any of the work for them. 
Now, this obviously isn't the only way and maybe not even

105
00:11:27.480 --> 00:11:32.740
the best way to teach but the point is, I'd like you to
remember that teaching someone to walk on their own two feet

106
00:11:33.020 --> 00:11:39.760
should never involve you walking for them. Allowing them to
struggle through the process is better for them in the long

107
00:11:39.760 --> 00:11:47.970
run because making it easy on them in class will only make
it harder on them in real life. Another thing, teachers, to

108
00:11:47.970 --> 00:11:55.780
stop doing is talking so much about English. Just talk about
life, you know what I'm saying? There are countless hours of

109
00:11:55.780 --> 00:12:01.540
free content online explaining how the English language
works, and not only is it generally uninteresting to talk

110
00:12:01.540 --> 00:12:07.650
about, it's also not what an English learner really needs to
know. Unless, of course, they're trying to pass a test that

111
00:12:07.650 --> 00:12:14.980
requires them to know it, like the IELTS, for example. But
imagine paying for dancing classes and arriving in class

112
00:12:15.030 --> 00:12:23.170
only to watch videos of other people dancing or having
conversations about dancing. That would be weird. And you

113
00:12:23.170 --> 00:12:29.900
probably want your money back. You didn't pay for dance
classes to sit around and talk about dancing. You paid

114
00:12:29.900 --> 00:12:36.270
because you wanted to learn how to dance. English students
generally don't pay for classes because they want to talk

115
00:12:36.330 --> 00:12:44.160
about English. They pay for classes because they want to
learn how to use English naturally and confidently. And most

116
00:12:44.160 --> 00:12:49.970
students don't live in an English-speaking country, so they
already spend most of their free time consuming content in

117
00:12:49.970 --> 00:12:57.730
English and or about English. That's generally all they can
do, or at least that's what they believe. So when they get

118
00:12:57.730 --> 00:13:03.780
to class, what they really want and need is to practice
using the language, not consume more information about it.

119
00:13:03.780 --> 00:13:11.120
And why not just talk about interesting things like common
and uncommon interests or life experiences, pop culture,

120
00:13:12.080 --> 00:13:18.540
things like these. This allows your students to learn in a
relaxed, natural environment and use the language the same

121
00:13:18.540 --> 00:13:24.540
way they would in the real world. And they end up learning
how to communicate in English without realizing it the same

122
00:13:24.540 --> 00:13:32.150
way they learned their native language without realizing it.
You see what I'm saying? Now, another thing I think teachers

123
00:13:32.270 --> 00:13:41.040
should stop doing immediately is treating their students
like children. I'm not sure why some teachers, like, choose

124
00:13:41.040 --> 00:13:48.930
to treat grown ass men and women like toddlers. And just
because they have the speaking ability similar to that of a

125
00:13:48.930 --> 00:13:56.840
child doesn't make them children. So smiling abnormally
often or using baby talk and a silly voice is something you

126
00:13:56.840 --> 00:14:03.050
would never do if you were speaking to a native you just
met. So why the fuck are they speaking to adult students

127
00:14:03.050 --> 00:14:10.440
like that, bro? I don't get it. Now, maybe some teachers
want to make the extra effort to create a safe environment

128
00:14:10.440 --> 00:14:15.720
for their students so they can feel comfortable enough to
speak and make mistakes. I get that a hundred percent, but

129
00:14:15.720 --> 00:14:22.660
there's a difference between safe and fake. People in the
real world aren't gonna treat them like babies or have the

130
00:14:22.660 --> 00:14:29.200
level of patience that language teachers have. I personally
don't appreciate being talked to as if I'm a child or as if

131
00:14:29.200 --> 00:14:36.480
I'm stupid. And in my experience, most other adults feel the
same way. I just find that if you're straight with people,

132
00:14:37.160 --> 00:14:42.620
they tend to appreciate it more than you trying to be nice
to them, you know? Now, this, of course, is just my opinion

133
00:14:42.620 --> 00:14:49.880
based on my experience. Everyone's different so take what
I'm saying with a grain of salt, obviously, you know? Now,

134
00:14:49.880 --> 00:14:55.310
there are a bunch of things that you could start or stop
doing if you want to have better English classes. These are

135
00:14:55.310 --> 00:15:00.600
just a few that come to mind when I reflect on my experience
teaching and learning languages online. So if you're an

136
00:15:00.600 --> 00:15:05.350
English teacher or learner, I'd love to hear about your
perspective on this subject so feel free to send me a

137
00:15:05.350 --> 00:15:14.080
message on Discord, or hit me up on Twitter - @tonykaizen,
or shoot me a DM on Instagram - @englishwithkaizen. But

138
00:15:14.080 --> 00:15:18.700
that's it for now, my friend. I hope you enjoyed this
episode. Thank you so much for your time and your attention.

139
00:15:18.700 --> 00:15:23.760
Please remember, if you live your life in English, you will
learn English. Please remember if you practice English

140
00:15:23.760 --> 00:15:27.320
consistently, you will learn English.

141
00:15:27.430 --> 00:15:32.860
Please remember if you invest in your education, if you
invest in yourself and your skills, if you stay dedicated,

142
00:15:32.860 --> 00:15:39.630
my friend, get a good teacher, a good mentor, some good
friends, apply the right methods, there is nothing that you

143
00:15:39.630 --> 00:15:40.170
cannot do.

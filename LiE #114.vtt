00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.759
What's up, everybody?

00:00:00.759 --> 00:00:03.270
You're listening to another episode of Life in English.

00:00:03.310 --> 00:00:05.460
I'm your your host, Tony Kaizen.

00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:12.990
And in this episode, I'm going to talk about what I believe is the best and worst thing about the age of digital media.

00:00:43.735 --> 00:00:47.515
I truly believe the internet is one of the best inventions of all time.

00:00:48.935 --> 00:00:52.085
In many ways, the internet democratized the exchange of information.

00:00:52.925 --> 00:00:57.065
Before the invention of the internet, if you wanted your content to be consumed by the masses,

00:00:57.245 --> 00:01:02.015
you'd have to find a way to get it in a newspaper, on national television, or on the radio...

00:01:02.675 --> 00:01:05.375
and that simply wasn't possible for the vast majority of people,

00:01:05.585 --> 00:01:11.135
either because it was too expensive or whoever was in charge, simply didn't think your content was good enough to be shared.

00:01:12.295 --> 00:01:13.475
The internet changed all that.

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:21.420
Now anybody can create their own newspaper, radio station, TV channel, art gallery, or book publishing house.

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:30.630
You can create a blog, a podcast, a YouTube channel, a photography website, or social media account and easily publish or distribute electronic books.

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:35.790
Before, you would only see what the major networks and companies wanted you to see.

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:41.095
Now, you have the ability to consume all kinds of content from people around the world,

00:01:41.305 --> 00:01:46.765
and also have your content found and appreciated by hundreds of thousands or even millions of people.

00:01:47.875 --> 00:01:52.705
This is great because artists, content creators, doctors, philosophers, psychologists,

00:01:52.735 --> 00:01:58.405
teachers, and business owners can create and share their work with the world almost instantly,

00:01:59.035 --> 00:02:01.745
which has an incredible impact on the way their careers develop.

00:02:02.845 --> 00:02:09.495
It's even better for you as a content consumer, because it means that you will never not have some form of entertainment available to you.

00:02:10.725 --> 00:02:14.895
It's always there, 24/7 and people are constantly making more.

00:02:16.125 --> 00:02:17.145
You want podcasts?

00:02:17.535 --> 00:02:18.105
No problem.

00:02:18.675 --> 00:02:19.695
You want another book?

00:02:20.115 --> 00:02:20.955
We got you covered.

00:02:21.405 --> 00:02:22.785
You want a new TV series?

00:02:23.175 --> 00:02:23.805
Say no more.

00:02:24.435 --> 00:02:25.185
More pictures?

00:02:25.635 --> 00:02:26.235
Here you go.

00:02:27.525 --> 00:02:30.855
You can also learn virtually anything on the internet these days.

00:02:32.325 --> 00:02:33.435
How to maintain your car,

00:02:33.855 --> 00:02:35.025
how to style your hair,

00:02:35.235 --> 00:02:36.285
how to cook a meal,

00:02:36.465 --> 00:02:38.235
how to survive in a foreign country,

00:02:38.415 --> 00:02:40.095
how to communicate more effectively,

00:02:40.305 --> 00:02:41.655
how to lose and gain weight,

00:02:42.105 --> 00:02:43.245
how to learn a language.

00:02:43.785 --> 00:02:44.835
The list goes on and on.

00:02:46.095 --> 00:02:51.465
Before the internet, you'd have to pay ridiculous amount of money to some institution to learn these things.

00:02:51.675 --> 00:02:53.835
And most of the time they'd just be teaching you theory.

00:02:54.885 --> 00:02:57.375
Most traditional schools don't teach you anything practical.

00:02:57.555 --> 00:03:00.395
So most students do nothing but waste time and money there.

00:03:01.595 --> 00:03:06.525
Now, you can take your education into your own hands and learn a skill in less than 18 months,

00:03:06.915 --> 00:03:10.335
and it will cost you a fraction of what you would have paid at a university.

00:03:10.995 --> 00:03:12.675
Many times you don't have to pay anything at all.

00:03:14.365 --> 00:03:23.625
Now, it also created countless new jobs, virtual assistant, video editor, digital marketing specialists, web and software developers, et cetera.

00:03:24.435 --> 00:03:29.365
Some of the biggest companies in the world exist and operate solely because of the internet.

00:03:30.345 --> 00:03:33.430
You're listening to me right now solely because of the internet.

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:40.510
It really is one of the best times to be alive when you think about all the things that modern technology has made possible.

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:44.830
People are sharing more information than ever before in human history,

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:52.240
more movies, music, books, podcasts, photos, paintings, lectures, stories, and ideas.

00:03:53.290 --> 00:04:00.975
People that really have something to say are being heard, and people that really do admirable work are being discovered every day.

00:04:02.265 --> 00:04:07.305
But you know what the worst part about all of this is we have no time to consume it all.

00:04:08.445 --> 00:04:14.475
There's so much content being created on a daily basis that you couldn't consume it all even in 10 lifetimes.

00:04:14.475 --> 00:04:16.405
It simply isn't impossible.

00:04:17.445 --> 00:04:22.725
You have to work, spend time with family and friends, eat, exercise, sleep, clean the house.

00:04:23.475 --> 00:04:24.405
There's always something to be done.

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:31.110
Meanwhile, thousands of pieces of content are being uploaded every minute of every day.

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:38.850
I'm not saying that we should be able to consume all the content in the world because honestly, I don't think that would be good either.

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:42.630
Humans aren't really meant to be consuming things all the time.

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:47.100
I don't think any form of life is meant to be consuming all the time.

00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:51.640
In fact, I think producing is just as, if not more important than consuming.

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:56.460
The act of producing is much more rewarding and fulfilling, in my opinion.

00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:05.370
I'm saying even in the context of content you probably enjoy consuming, you'll never be able to consume it all.

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:08.910
Like, take me as an example, I love photography

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:16.410
and I love the fact that photographers all over the world finally have the ability to create and share their work with potentially millions of people.

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:20.280
I have a deep appreciation for visual artwork.

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:26.310
So I really enjoy viewing interesting photos, watching good movies, appreciating beautiful paintings, et cetera.

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:34.770
But it makes me kind of sad when I think about the fact that there's so much
great artwork out there that I will simply never see or be able to appreciate.

00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:39.620
I know this is normal and this is how it was even before the internet was created.

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:44.770
Before the internet, we were typically only aware of what was happening in our neighborhood or city,

00:05:45.130 --> 00:05:47.530
and whatever was happening on the TV or the radio.

00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:51.910
The happenings and people of the world were almost non-existent to us

00:05:51.910 --> 00:05:56.650
because we didn't know anything about them unless we left our neighborhood or city.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:04.670
I'm just saying that the internet made me even more aware of the fact that is a big world out there and a lot of stuff is happening.

00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:07.585
And since I'm someone who values experiences,

00:06:07.795 --> 00:06:13.705
it kind of sucks to think that there are so many great things in life that I will never experience, even though I know that's totally normal,

00:06:13.915 --> 00:06:19.765
and even though I know that it's all the more reason to get out there and experience everything I can until the day I die.

00:06:20.065 --> 00:06:22.225
So I'm not really trying to make any point in particular here.

00:06:22.645 --> 00:06:24.385
This is just something I think about from time to time.

00:06:26.215 --> 00:06:34.750
Now, another inevitable downside to the invention of the internet and social media is that algorithms decide who and what gets found organically.

00:06:36.100 --> 00:06:39.460
Just because you post a video or a great video on YouTube,

00:06:39.850 --> 00:06:43.840
doesn't mean that people around the world will be able to find and appreciate your work.

00:06:45.130 --> 00:06:47.550
The internet is only semi-democratic.

00:06:48.700 --> 00:06:55.310
At the end of the day, a search engine, like YouTube shows you what it thinks you want to see, and it makes that decision based on many things.

00:06:56.140 --> 00:07:01.900
How many people click on your video, how long people watched the video, and what they do after they watch your video,

00:07:02.140 --> 00:07:07.300
and even how many other people are making videos about the same topic has an effect on who sees your videos.

00:07:08.380 --> 00:07:11.290
I'm not necessarily saying this is a bad thing, because at the end of the day,

00:07:11.290 --> 00:07:17.110
there has to be some kind of system in place that determines which content is good and useful, and which content is not.

00:07:18.340 --> 00:07:23.810
I'm just saying that making good content doesn't guarantee that your content will be found and appreciated.

00:07:24.825 --> 00:07:28.185
But that's also where the ability to create your own website becomes important, right?

00:07:29.355 --> 00:07:35.325
Anybody can create their own website, which means that anybody can have their own little piece of real estate in cyberspace.

00:07:36.405 --> 00:07:39.345
Having a social media account is like renting an apartment.

00:07:40.455 --> 00:07:44.145
The account is yours, but you don't make the rules and you don't own the platform.

00:07:45.045 --> 00:07:50.705
You can be blocked or banned at any time, and the owner decides who and how many people see your content.

00:07:51.955 --> 00:07:54.130
A website on the other hand is like owning a home.

00:07:55.270 --> 00:07:57.640
You decide what you can or cannot put on a website.

00:07:58.210 --> 00:08:01.030
You decide what the site looks like and what the site is for.

00:08:01.900 --> 00:08:05.260
You simply have to find a way to get people to your website.

00:08:06.340 --> 00:08:10.750
Whereas on social media, there's already a huge audience of people actively looking for content,

00:08:11.560 --> 00:08:17.050
with your website, you have to create the audience and give them a reason to consistently come back to your platform

00:08:17.080 --> 00:08:19.140
instead of staying on the most popular ones.

00:08:21.130 --> 00:08:25.915
Another downside to the digital age is that oftentimes there are simply too many options,

00:08:27.055 --> 00:08:31.525
too many series, too many podcasts, too many videos, too many courses.

00:08:32.755 --> 00:08:34.975
Having too many options, it makes it hard to choose, right?

00:08:36.535 --> 00:08:42.535
Have you ever found yourself spending more time looking for a video to watch than you actually spent watching the video?

00:08:43.795 --> 00:08:44.665
That's what I'm talking about.

00:08:46.315 --> 00:08:47.345
Sometimes less is more.

00:08:48.160 --> 00:08:56.050
And with the access to endless streams of content and entertainment comes a responsibility of choosing what, when and how to consume.

00:08:57.790 --> 00:08:58.510
But what do you think?

00:08:59.500 --> 00:09:01.780
Is now really one of the best times to be alive?

00:09:02.930 --> 00:09:08.080
Has the democratization of the exchange of information helped or hurt society as a whole?

00:09:09.310 --> 00:09:11.830
Has it helped or hurt you as an individual?

00:09:13.180 --> 00:09:15.240
What type of content would you like to see more of?

00:09:16.640 --> 00:09:18.355
Send me a message and let me know, you know,

00:09:18.385 --> 00:09:21.355
or start a conversation about this topic with your language exchange partner.

00:09:22.095 --> 00:09:25.605
This is Life in English, I'm Tony Kaizen, and I'll talk to you later.

00:09:26.345 --> 00:09:26.625
Peace

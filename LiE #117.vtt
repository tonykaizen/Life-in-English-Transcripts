00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.680
I'm your host, Tony Kaizen.

4
00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:10.000
And in this episode, I want to talk about the common question,

5
00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:14.170
"Will moving to another country help me become fluent?"

6
00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:24.780

12
00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:51.280
There's a really common misconception about the idea that moving to another country will help you become fluent in a language.

13
00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:55.230
And although I think it definitely can help, you know,

14
00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:58.840
Because when you're in a foreign country and nobody speaks your language,

15
00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:03.310
If you don't learn to communicate, you probably will have a hard time surviving.

16
00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:09.870
So the fact that you're forced to use the language and communicate is positive because you have..

17
00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:11.670
You really have no choice at that point,

18
00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:17.300
And you're naturally going to start to learn common words and phrases and how to survive in basic situations.

19
00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:21.710
Like, at the post office, the restaurant, bars, on the bus and things like that.

20
00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:23.630
The basic stuff, of course, you're going to learn.

21
00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.440
But what I think a lot of people don't understand,

22
00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:36.640
Is that moving to a foreign country to learn the language isn't, like, the most effective solution to your problem.

23
00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:43.140
And when I say problem, I mean, you don't speak this language that you want to learn how to speak.

24
00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:45.890
You don't know how to communicate effectively yet.

25
00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.290
That's the problem or the situation, let's say.

26
00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:52.760
And you think, you know, "There's no way I could do it from my home.

27
00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:57.440
So the only way I can become fluent in English is if I move to an English-speaking country.

28
00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:00.930
And I stay there for three or six or twelve months. That's the only way.

29
00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:06.910
And although, like I said, it will have a positive effect on your English speaking skills.

30
00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:10.060
And your understanding of the language and culture and things like that...

31
00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:13.770
When you stop and think about how much money that's going to cost you.

32
00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:18.720
I'm not sure it's the best solution. You know what I mean?

33
00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:21.210
I'm not sure it's the best option. And I'll tell you why.

34
00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:27.620
You have access to the internet, which means you have access to the world and all the people in it,

35
00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:32.060
Or at least all the people with social media accounts and websites and emails and things like that,

36
00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:36.110
Which is most people that have electronic devices, let's say.

37
00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:39.550
It's millions, billions of people. That's what I'm trying to say.

38
00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:46.130
And you can talk to these people, most of the time, for free. Right?

39
00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:50.400
You have language exchange apps, you have language exchange websites, you have social media,

40
00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:54.870
YouTube channels, private conversation groups, and things like that.

41
00:02:55.700 --> 00:03:01.710
You have so many options and so many ways to talk to people for free online from the comfort of your home,

42
00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:07.690
You could be at the gym, you could be on the bus, you could be walking through the park on the phone with somebody in Japan.

43
00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:14.070
For free. For free. You see what I'm saying?

44
00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:16.980
So again, I've said this multiple times,

45
00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:21.060
English courses.. very valuable, very important, very useful.

46
00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:24.790
English teachers.. Valuable, important, and useful.

47
00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:28.570
Traveling to the foreign country, a priceless experience.

48
00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:31.540
If you can do it, do it. Don't think twice about it.

49
00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:37.040
So now that we got that out the way, I'm just saying, is it the best option for you right now?

50
00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:41.860
Do you really believe the only way you can learn a language is by moving to the country?

51
00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:47.420
Because in your mind, then "Oh, I'll be forced to use the language, so then I'll be forced to learn."

52
00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:52.740
I don't think so, because what you've got to understand is most people in my experience,

53
00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:57.730
Most people come to this country or go to some other foreign country with that idea in their minds,

54
00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:00.200
Which is "I'll be forced to use the language."

55
00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:03.870
Excuse me, "I'll be forced to use the language so then I'll learn."

56
00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:06.970
And then they go and they sit in their hotel all day,

57
00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:10.310
Or they go and just walk around the city looking at buildings.

58
00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:13.290
And, you know, then they go into restaurants and ask for food.

59
00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:16.970
They go on the bus and say hello to the bus driver, and that's it.

60
00:04:17.830 --> 00:04:18.990
They're not making any friends.

61
00:04:19.270 --> 00:04:20.490
They're not communicating with people.

62
00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:25.900
They're not going out to bars or clubs or places where they can find other people to interact with.

63
00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:26.800
They're not doing any of that.

64
00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:32.830
They sit inside their little shell, kind of just watching everything happen and then they come back home and say,

65
00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:35.440
"Oh, I've been to that place. Yeah, I've been there.

66
00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:39.090
I've been to the U.S. 15 times and I still don't speak English."

67
00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:46.280
It's like... So what I'm trying to say is with that example,

68
00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:50.990
What I'm trying to say is clearly just going to that place isn't the only thing you need,

69
00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:56.310
Because if you're afraid to talk to people right now online in the comfort of your own home,

70
00:04:56.610 --> 00:05:00.550
What makes you think you're going to just miraculously turn into this social butterfly.

71
00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:04.490
When you go to the foreign country and nobody even speaks your language?

72
00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:08.180
What makes you think that is just going to solve all your problems?

73
00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:15.720
Spending hundreds or thousands of dollars on plane tickets, accommodation, visas, taxes, currency exchange rates,

74
00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:18.570
All of that just to learn the foreign language.

75
00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:26.280
There's a better option, bro. It's called a language exchange or a private language teacher or something like that.

76
00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:27.620
You know what I'm saying?

77
00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:29.850
What I think you have to figure out first,

78
00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:34.190
What I think you have to do first is just get comfortable talking to people.

79
00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:39.960
And the easiest, most cost-effective way to do that is just finding a language exchange partner.

80
00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:44.720
Like, I learned how to speak Spanish before I went to Mexico.

81
00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:50.580
I learned how to speak Portuguese before I went to Brazil, without leaving my house, for free.

82
00:05:52.390 --> 00:05:52.930
You see what I'm saying?

83
00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:57.970
And I'm not like some special genius or something like that, anybody can do it,

84
00:05:57.970 --> 00:06:02.740
I know many other people that have done it, you know, before they ever went to the country.

85
00:06:03.090 --> 00:06:07.840
Just like I know a bunch of people that simply went to the foreign country thinking,

86
00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:11.220
"OK, this is going to make me fluent. I just need to live there. That's the only way."

87
00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:14.160
And they come back and you ask them about their experience.

88
00:06:14.510 --> 00:06:17.290
"What did you do? Did you make any friends? Did you improve your English?"

89
00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:22.390
"No, not really. It's hard to make friends, and I didn't know where to go or what to do,

90
00:06:22.390 --> 00:06:29.920
So I kind of just walked around and stayed to myself, or I found other people that speak my language and I talk to them all the time."

91
00:06:30.190 --> 00:06:31.070
That's what most people do.

92
00:06:31.490 --> 00:06:37.840
There are people that live or have lived in the U.S. for decades and still don't speak English.

93
00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:41.920
Happens all the time.

94
00:06:42.010 --> 00:06:48.230
So simply going to that place where they speak the language increases the chance that you will find people that speak that language,

95
00:06:48.270 --> 00:06:50.510
But you still have to approach them and talk to them.

96
00:06:50.510 --> 00:06:53.350
And if you can't do that, what are you going to do?

97
00:06:54.930 --> 00:06:57.750
How are you going to learn and improve and become fluent just because you're there?

98
00:06:57.750 --> 00:07:00.190
You see what I'm saying?

99
00:07:00.190 --> 00:07:06.710
So the point I'm trying to make is, yeah, moving to the foreign country increases the chances that you become fluent, of course.

100
00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:15.660
But if you're not going to be actively putting yourself in situations where you have to use the language,

101
00:07:15.750 --> 00:07:19.080
interact with the language, immerse yourself in the culture,

102
00:07:20.040 --> 00:07:22.700
what's the point in spending all that money to go to that country?

103
00:07:23.130 --> 00:07:26.710
You could sit at home on your couch, on your phone, or your computer.

104
00:07:27.080 --> 00:07:32.650
And talk to hundreds of people from that country for free and become fluent in the language.

105
00:07:34.420 --> 00:07:38.790
So this idea that "You just have to go to the country, that's the only way you'll be fluent."

106
00:07:38.790 --> 00:07:42.510
I say bullshit. It's bullshit.

107
00:07:43.110 --> 00:07:46.440
Just learn how to talk to people, learn how to have conversations,

108
00:07:46.680 --> 00:07:51.210
learn how to be interested in other people, and you'll always have somebody to talk to,

109
00:07:51.570 --> 00:07:55.870
which means you'll always have opportunities to improve your language and communication skills.

110
00:07:56.120 --> 00:07:58.230
You don't need to travel halfway around the world to do that.

111
00:07:58.520 --> 00:08:02.640
Most likely, you're just going to waste money and time traveling halfway around the world to do that.

112
00:08:02.810 --> 00:08:07.170
Because if you can't, you know, step outside your comfort zone and approach somebody online,

113
00:08:07.260 --> 00:08:15.140
for free, with very little risk or without even really having to feel hard rejection,

114
00:08:16.080 --> 00:08:20.590
what makes you think you'll be able to do it in person in that country halfway across the world?

115
00:08:21.590 --> 00:08:24.240
You know? Just something to think about.

116
00:08:25.200 --> 00:08:31.010
You have so many tools. So much technology at your disposal. Most of it is free.

117
00:08:31.680 --> 00:08:35.400
Why not use it so that when you finally get the chance to go to the country,

118
00:08:35.400 --> 00:08:37.440
you're not thinking about becoming fluent in the language,

119
00:08:37.710 --> 00:08:40.000
you're just thinking about enjoying the experience?

120
00:08:40.950 --> 00:08:45.290
Using the language like the tool that is to communicate with the people to get what you want to get,

121
00:08:45.290 --> 00:08:49.640
where you want to go, to meet who you want to meet, to create those memorable experiences.

122
00:08:50.140 --> 00:08:50.660
You know what I'm saying?

123
00:08:51.670 --> 00:08:54.460
This is just the way I think about it. Obviously, you could disagree.

124
00:08:54.460 --> 00:08:59.040
You might have a different philosophy, but it's just weird that you hear all the time, people think,

125
00:08:59.320 --> 00:09:02.490
"When I finally," it's like this destination addiction that people have.

126
00:09:02.490 --> 00:09:04.950
"When I finally get the chance to go to that place,

127
00:09:05.500 --> 00:09:09.330
then I'll practice my English and then I'll become fluent because it's an obligation at that point."

128
00:09:09.570 --> 00:09:14.520
But if you can't obligate yourself to do it at home, when nobody's forcing you to do it,

129
00:09:14.970 --> 00:09:18.370
what makes you think you'll do it when you go to that country?

130
00:09:18.430 --> 00:09:23.210
You're just going to do what you always do, which is just enough to get by, just enough to survive.

131
00:09:23.230 --> 00:09:30.240
So it's about your mindset. You have to create the immersive environment where.. Wherever you are right now.

132
00:09:31.510 --> 00:09:36.420
Not wait until this, you know, imaginary moment in time when you'll be forced to do it.

133
00:09:37.910 --> 00:09:41.690
That doesn't make sense, you know, and that's the concept of Life in English.

134
00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:45.900
Because I learned, after learning Spanish and Portuguese from my home,

135
00:09:46.390 --> 00:09:51.330
that if you just live your life in that language now, you'll learn that language now.

136
00:09:52.970 --> 00:09:53.520
You see what I'm saying?

137
00:09:55.730 --> 00:09:59.240
I don't know, like, my experiences in Mexico and Brazil would have been completely different.

138
00:09:59.510 --> 00:10:05.370
if I had waited to start learning the language until after I arrived in those countries.

139
00:10:06.690 --> 00:10:09.870
I would not have had half of the amazing experiences I had.

140
00:10:11.060 --> 00:10:18.670
if I hadn't chosen to start learning the languages months and in some cases years before I went to the country. You know?

141
00:10:20.230 --> 00:10:23.600
So anyway, man, like I said, it's just something to think about.

142
00:10:24.310 --> 00:10:26.710
You don't need to travel to some foreign country to learn the language.

143
00:10:26.710 --> 00:10:29.090
You have the internet, it's fucking free.

144
00:10:30.160 --> 00:10:34.860
There are hundreds of teachers online offering courses for reasonable prices that will teach you what you really need to know.

145
00:10:35.340 --> 00:10:41.210
There are tens, maybe even hundreds of platforms where you can find people to talk to for free.

146
00:10:43.230 --> 00:10:51.330
You know, so it's not about what situation you need to be in to become fluent or what location you need to be in to become fluent.

147
00:10:51.670 --> 00:10:57.650
It's about what you are going to have the discipline to make yourself do on a regular basis,

148
00:10:57.880 --> 00:11:00.380
consistently, day in and day out.

149
00:11:00.970 --> 00:11:05.110
The effort that you're going to put into it determines what the result is going to be.

150
00:11:06.470 --> 00:11:12.900
You shouldn't be waiting for some external force to obligate you to do something that not only you want to do, but you know you need to do.

151
00:11:14.100 --> 00:11:15.220
You know? You need to do that now.

152
00:11:16.130 --> 00:11:20.990
So if finding a private teacher or a language exchange partner is not your number one priority at the moment,

153
00:11:22.740 --> 00:11:26.480
it just tells me you're not really serious about learning how to communicate in English.

154
00:11:27.620 --> 00:11:29.940
We might disagree on that, but again, it's just my opinion.

155
00:11:29.940 --> 00:11:31.860
It just tells me you're not serious.

156
00:11:32.850 --> 00:11:37.130
Because we've already established that's the best way to improve.

157
00:11:37.290 --> 00:11:44.190
Everybody watches videos, listens to podcasts, reads books and news articles, and is on social media consuming content in English.

158
00:11:44.390 --> 00:11:47.850
But how many people are talking to another human being on a regular basis?

159
00:11:49.290 --> 00:11:52.200
Not very many. Not very many...

160
00:11:53.010 --> 00:11:54.770
Which is why not very many people,

161
00:11:55.770 --> 00:12:04.530
relatively not very many people reach this high level of English fluency that everybody says they want. You know?

162
00:12:05.980 --> 00:12:11.800
So if this is the first time you've ever heard somebody say this, or maybe you've heard it before and you never took it seriously,

163
00:12:12.100 --> 00:12:17.880
you know, hopefully, you can get what I'm trying to say, and you'll at least consider what I'm saying.

164
00:12:19.880 --> 00:12:22.530
Moving to another country isn't the key to becoming fluent.

165
00:12:23.080 --> 00:12:30.710
Living your life in that language is the key to becoming fluent, and you can do that from anywhere in the world... anywhere.

166
00:12:30.790 --> 00:12:34.360
Stop making excuses and just do what you know you need to do.

167
00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:40.620
In my opinion, it's that simple. So... There you go.

168
00:12:41.830 --> 00:12:47.210
This is Life in English. I'm your host, Tony Kaizen, and I'll talk to you later. Peace.

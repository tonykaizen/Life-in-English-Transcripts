Tony Kaizen:
Americans are so dumb.

2
00:00:03.850 --> 00:00:09.330
Americans are so uneducated. Americans are so arrogant.

3
00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:15.960
Americans think they're the center of the universe and
everything revolves around them. Why don't Americans know

4
00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:22.460
where Kazakhstan is? Why don't Americans know that
Brazilians don't speak Spanish? Why don't Americans know

5
00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:28.370
what's going on outside of the U.S.? And why the fuck do
Americans call themselves Americans when we're all

6
00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:35.100
Americans? I've been hearing comments and questions like
these on a regular basis since I started teaching English

7
00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:44.490
back in 2018. So many people harbor so much anger, disdain,
and resentment for America. They resent Americans for acting

8
00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:51.460
like the U.S. as the most important country on the planet.
Now, what I find most interesting, though, is that 99% of

9
00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:56.740
the time, when an American shows that he or she doesn't know
something about a foreign country or that they simply have a

10
00:00:56.740 --> 00:01:02.770
misconception about another country, people from other
countries choose to get angry, judgmental, and

11
00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:09.900
condescending, as if they don't have any misconceptions
about countries they've never been to. "Look at that fucking

12
00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:18.160
stupid American. He thinks we all live in the dirt and don't
have electricity? Arrogant piece of shit American. She

13
00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:26.620
thinks her language is difficult? Try learning French,
asshole!" Now I understand, people are extremely sensitive,

14
00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:34.440
especially these days. Many of us live in a clickbait,
headline-reading, "speak before you think" type of world. So

15
00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:39.610
when someone sees something they don't like or agree with,
their natural reaction is to get offended and tell the world

16
00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:46.430
what they're thinking in the comment section of a complete
stranger's video. I don't condone this type of behavior, but

17
00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:52.360
I understand it. But what you have to understand about the
United States of America is that most people in this country

18
00:01:52.360 --> 00:02:01.970
do not give a single fuck about you, your country, your
language, or the resentment in your heart. This isn't

19
00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:06.850
because we think other countries are less important or
inferior. It's because we're simply not exposed to life

20
00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:14.450
outside the U.S. And I say we for the sake of simplicity,
this is, of course, just my opinion. I do not and I cannot

21
00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:18.720
speak for all 330 million Americans.

22
00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:25.760
So, let's continue. Let's talk about public school. In the
U.S.

23
00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:31.910
in my experience, in public school, we're taught about
things like how to read and write in English, literature,

24
00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:40.840
algebra, geometry, calculus, sciences like biology and
chemistry, physical education like sports and fitness, the

25
00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:48.410
robotic basics of a foreign language, and something called
social studies, which covers history and geography. But

26
00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:55.960
here's the thing - we're taught about the history and the
geography of the United States of America. Not Brazil, not

27
00:02:55.960 --> 00:03:04.520
Russia, not Vietnam. not Tanzania, not Scotland. The United
States of America. That's why Americans don't really know

28
00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:10.780
which languages people speak in Eritrea. That's why
Americans don't know that Turkey is a very interesting place

29
00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:16.840
because it's technically both an Asian and a European
country. That's why Americans think that everyone who speaks

30
00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:24.930
Spanish is Mexican. That's why Americans don't know what
life outside the U.S. is really like. It's because the only

31
00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:30.690
exposure we get to life outside of our country is one of
those commercials with sad music and a starving kid sitting

32
00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:36.700
in the dirt somewhere in Africa trying to convince you that
donating just $0.35 a day will feed that starving child.

33
00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:45.440
That's why even today, people think that's what life is like
for everybody in Africa. And even though we've got people

34
00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:50.690
from all over the world living and working here, most
Americans don't know anything about different languages and

35
00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:57.970
cultures. And in my opinion, that's because although the
U.S. is an incredibly diverse country, ethnically speaking,

36
00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:04.330
we're still very divided in many ways. It's hard to
generalize, but many people here tend to hang out with

37
00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:11.090
people they identify with. And due to the history of this
country, people tend to identify with people that look and

38
00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:18.210
sound like them. And maybe that's human nature. But if
that's the case, I think the history of segregation in this

39
00:04:18.210 --> 00:04:23.360
country exacerbated that problem and created a lot of
barriers that keep us from understanding and appreciating

40
00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:32.280
people and cultures different from our own. So think about
it. If from the time you're born, you're taught to stick

41
00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:40.070
with your own; if you grow up in a neighborhood that isn't
multicultural, and you're taught that everyone or anyone who

42
00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:47.830
doesn't look or sound like you is the enemy, then you
probably wouldn't ever feel motivated to get to know someone

43
00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:54.500
of a different ethnic or cultural background. You probably
would take whatever you see on TV and use that as a

44
00:04:54.500 --> 00:05:00.180
representation of the people you know nothing about and
you've never even interacted with. And to take it a step

45
00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:04.930
further, you'd be looking through the lens of your
misconceptions when trying to interpret the behavior of

46
00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:12.090
those people, only further reinforcing the ignorant
misconceptions you have. And let me remind you, everyone

47
00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:14.620
does that, not just Americans.

48
00:05:15.390 --> 00:05:20.290
We're all emotional creatures with faulty logic that just
want to feel like we understand things and that we're in

49
00:05:20.290 --> 00:05:29.740
control. But getting back to the Americans, these stupid,
ungrateful, arrogant, racist pieces of shit. Many Americans

50
00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:35.530
don't know much about other countries because we're never
really encouraged to. Most Americans don't travel

51
00:05:35.530 --> 00:05:42.080
internationally. Most Americans don't speak more than one
language, right? Most Americans are uneducated about all

52
00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:48.650
kinds of things like finance, tax laws, investments, the
judicial system, politics, health care, business,

53
00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:56.110
psychology. I mean, the list goes on and on. Many of us
don't know shit about our own country, so it would be

54
00:05:56.200 --> 00:06:02.710
unreasonable to expect us to know something about any other
country. From the time we were little kids until the day we

55
00:06:02.710 --> 00:06:10.590
die, we're being told that America is the greatest country
on the planet. We're taught to be proud to be Americans.

56
00:06:19.750 --> 00:06:28.720
Lee Greenwood (God Bless the USA song plays):
If tomorrow all the things were gone, I'd worked for all my
life. And I had to start again, with

57
00:06:29.820 --> 00:06:38.670
just my children and my wife. I'd thank my lucky stars to be
living here today.

58
00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:46.050
'Cause the flag still stands for freedom and they can't take
that away.

59
00:06:50.430 --> 00:06:56.640
And I'm proud to be an American where at least I know I'm
free.

60
00:06:56.640 --> 00:07:03.030
And I won't forget the men who died, who gave that right to
me.

61
00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:11.160
And I gladly stand up, next to you and defend her still
today.

62
00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:19.310
'Cause there ain't no doubt I love this land, God bless the
USA.

63
00:07:28.220 --> 00:07:36.660
Tony Kaizen:
We are always consuming America. Where is Hollywood - the
heart of the film industry? In the United States of America.

64
00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:45.790
Where's the heart of the mainstream music industry? In the
United States of America. What do we see on the news? Shit

65
00:07:45.790 --> 00:07:53.900
that's happening in the United States of America. What books
are most of us reading? Books written in English by people

66
00:07:53.900 --> 00:08:01.650
from the United States of America. To what flag are we
expected to pledge allegiance every single morning before

67
00:08:01.650 --> 00:08:10.790
school starts? The flag of the United States of America. I
genuinely do not believe that most Americans harbor hatred

68
00:08:10.790 --> 00:08:17.390
for people from other countries or they think they're
inferior in some way. I think most Americans don't know and

69
00:08:17.390 --> 00:08:22.860
have no reason to care about people from other countries.
It's hard to care about something if you don't know it

70
00:08:22.860 --> 00:08:31.140
exists. The same way I imagine a gorilla born in captivity
doesn't dream of a rainforest in the Congo. I mean, how

71
00:08:31.140 --> 00:08:37.760
could it dream about or want to get to a place if it doesn't
know it exists? And maybe that doesn't make sense. My point

72
00:08:37.760 --> 00:08:44.490
is, if you're born in this box and all you've known since
the day you were born is that box, and everybody in the box

73
00:08:44.490 --> 00:08:51.530
is telling you this is the greatest box to ever exist, this
is the only box that exists, I doubt you would spend your

74
00:08:51.530 --> 00:08:58.780
days dreaming about another box if you'd never even had any
idea or a clue or indication that there are hundreds of

75
00:08:58.780 --> 00:09:02.790
boxes that you could explore and get to know.

76
00:09:03.990 --> 00:09:10.180
You know, I just can't see how you would naturally think
about all those other boxes. You just...you don't know they

77
00:09:10.180 --> 00:09:11.550
exist. Right?

78
00:09:11.870 --> 00:09:19.200
Hopefully that makes sense. Now, another topic of discussion
that's really starting to get old is the idea that people

79
00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:26.070
from the U.S. shouldn't refer to themselves as Americans
because America is a continent. So everyone from Canada all

80
00:09:26.070 --> 00:09:33.190
the way down to Argentina is an American. But let me make
this clear for anyone who holds this opinion, we call

81
00:09:33.190 --> 00:09:42.000
ourselves Americans because the name of our country is the
United States of America. That's literally the reason. So my

82
00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:50.230
question to you would be what should we call ourselves if
not "Americans"? And the answer I always get is something

83
00:09:50.230 --> 00:09:59.300
like "United Stadians". That sounds extremely awkward and it
also doesn't really make much sense. And, you know, I

84
00:09:59.300 --> 00:10:07.290
recently learned that the official name of Mexico is Los
Estados Unidos Mexicanos or the United Mexican States. And

85
00:10:07.290 --> 00:10:12.690
what do people from Mexico call themselves? Mexicanos,
right?

86
00:10:12.990 --> 00:10:21.080
They don't refer to themselves as Estado Mexicanos. Now,
Mexico is a part of North America. But Mexicans aren't North

87
00:10:21.080 --> 00:10:22.510
Americans, right?

88
00:10:23.060 --> 00:10:32.450
They're Latin Americans. And by the way, what do most people
in Latin America call people from the U.S.? Los Americanos.

89
00:10:33.190 --> 00:10:35.400
Us Americanos, right?

90
00:10:36.630 --> 00:10:41.960
The only people out here using the word estado-unidense are
people who don't appreciate the fact that we call ourselves

91
00:10:41.960 --> 00:10:48.210
Americans. Now, don't get me wrong, I know and understand
that the word estado-unidense is the correct word to use in

92
00:10:48.210 --> 00:10:57.330
Spanish or Portuguese, but that word simply doesn't exist in
English. It's nothing personal, bro. I promise. The ironic

93
00:10:57.330 --> 00:11:03.190
thing about all of this is that people complain about
Americans being uneducated and ignorant all the time and

94
00:11:03.950 --> 00:11:10.190
then they arrogantly talk down on Americans whenever we say
something out of ignorance. It's as if some people really

95
00:11:10.190 --> 00:11:16.680
think that they know everything there is to know about the
US and its people, and Americans have no clue what's going

96
00:11:16.680 --> 00:11:24.140
on in other countries. And that somehow makes them better
than Americans. But I'd like to put things in perspective

97
00:11:24.140 --> 00:11:29.480
and remind you that just because you watch the news and see
things about our country on social media doesn't mean that

98
00:11:29.480 --> 00:11:36.630
you know something about that country. If you haven't been
there and talked to hundreds of people, thousands of people

99
00:11:36.860 --> 00:11:44.760
from different walks of life, then you really don't know
anything. You simply know what you've heard. It's as if some

100
00:11:44.760 --> 00:11:51.000
people are upset because the entire world has its eyes on
the U.S. for one reason or another. And they're upset

101
00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:59.690
because no one is paying attention to them. The whole thing
to me is just a little irrational. But what's my point here?

102
00:12:01.010 --> 00:12:09.470
My point is the remedy to ignorance is education, not
arrogance. The idea that you can get mad and disrespect an

103
00:12:09.470 --> 00:12:15.500
individual simply because he or she doesn't know something
is pretty fucking childish and counterproductive, if you ask

104
00:12:15.500 --> 00:12:22.730
me. If you really cared about cultural understanding and
education, you would take the time to educate people when

105
00:12:22.730 --> 00:12:30.430
they say something ignorant. You wouldn't respond with
anger, resentment, and negativity because those things only

106
00:12:30.430 --> 00:12:38.000
generate more anger, resentment, and negativity. I guess
what I have a hard time understanding is how you could be

107
00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:39.920
offended by a question.

108
00:12:41.270 --> 00:12:47.480
I have a hard time understanding how you could be offended
by someone's opinion. I have a hard time understanding how

109
00:12:47.480 --> 00:12:54.650
you could be offended by someone's ignorance. Like, just
stop and imagine for a minute - if your parents or your

110
00:12:54.650 --> 00:13:03.390
teachers got mad and disrespectful with you every time you
didn't know something that they knew, it'd be pretty fucking

111
00:13:03.390 --> 00:13:10.590
ridiculous, right? So why is it that so many people choose
to react that way to Americans? Actually, it's not even that

112
00:13:10.590 --> 00:13:16.940
- people react that way to anyone they see as different.
Anyone who has an opposing opinion or an alternative

113
00:13:16.940 --> 00:13:26.590
lifestyle. Everyone is so quick to judge, condescend, talk
shit, criticize, ridicule, embarrass and

114
00:13:26.610 --> 00:13:36.250
cancel anyone who lives or thinks differently from them.
This has to stop. Instead of arrogance, choose

115
00:13:36.250 --> 00:13:40.840
humility. Instead of resentment, choose calmness.

116
00:13:41.950 --> 00:13:49.740
Instead of judgment, choose curiosity. And instead of
ignorance, choose education.

117
00:13:51.640 --> 00:13:51.930
Peace!

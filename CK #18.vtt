00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:06.050
Yo, man. We don't say "today morning" or "on the afternoon" or "today

2
00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:06.650
at night".

3
00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:08.440
So let me help you sound more natural.

4
00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:17.310
What's up, my friend? This is Coffee with Kaizen number 18.

5
00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:20.600
And in this episode, I'm going to help you correct a little grammar

6
00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:23.680
mistake That many learners of English make when they're talking

7
00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:25.410
about the time of the day.

8
00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:29.820
Now, I've heard many of my students say things like "today morning"

9
00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:31.790
or "on the afternoon"

10
00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:35.370
Or "today at night" when they're referring to the time of day that

11
00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:39.840
something happens. For example, today morning I went to the gym for

12
00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:44.150
an hour. Or today at night, I will go to the movies with my friends.

13
00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:47.070
Or I will see you this night.

14
00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:50.490
All of these sentences are grammatically incorrect,

15
00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:52.490
And to be honest, they sound a little strange.

16
00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:54.840
I would understand what you were trying to say,

17
00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:59.380
But I'm going to teach you how to express yourself more naturally.

18
00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:02.740
All right? So first, let's just talk about the times of the day to

19
00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:03.930
make sure we're on the same page.

20
00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:05.870
The first one, dawn.

21
00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:08.330
D A W N, dawn.

22
00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:12.350
This just refers to that period of the day that's right before

23
00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:16.210
sunrise. Right before the sun starts to rise over the horizon,

24
00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:19.730
Or at the moment the sun starts to rise over the horizon.

25
00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:21.970
That's what we refer to as dawn.

26
00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:24.830
It's not a specific time or anything like that.

27
00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:29.090
It's just that short little window of time when the sun is rising in

28
00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:31.980
the morning. All right? So after that, we have the morning, which

29
00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:33.560
is, you know, debatable.

30
00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:36.570
But let's say 5 am until 11:59 am.

31
00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:38.200
Let's just say that for an example.

32
00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:40.250
After that you have noon.

33
00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:43.680
N O O N. And that just refers to 12 pm.

34
00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:45.020
That specific point in time.

35
00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:50.270
Next, you have the afternoon, which is 12:01 pm to, let's say, seven

36
00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:51.790
p.m. Also debatable.

37
00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:53.180
Some people say 6:00 pm.

38
00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:54.870
Some people say 8:00 pm.

39
00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:56.230
But it's not the point.

40
00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:59.550
It's not important. So next we have the evening, which is more or

41
00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:02.600
less 7 pm to about 9 pm.

42
00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:06.350
Okay? In between the afternoon and the night is what we refer to as

43
00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:12.760
the evening. E V E N I N G, evening.

44
00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:15.050
All right? And after that, we have the night.

45
00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:20.460
N I G H T. And that's basically 9 pm until about 11:59 pm.

46
00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:23.800
Then we have midnight, which is 12 am.

47
00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:25.230
That specific point in time.

48
00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:29.640
Then after 12 am, you know, it can be referred to as the middle of

49
00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:31.860
the night or the morning.

50
00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:34.780
It just depends on the context and the person that's speaking.

51
00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:37.680
All right? But either way, I'm going to teach you how to talk about

52
00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:41.270
all of it. All right? So let me help you express yourself more

53
00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:44.550
naturally when referring to these times of the day, starting with

54
00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:49.580
'dawn'. Whenever we refer to this time of day, we say "at dawn",

55
00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:52.780
every time. All right? We don't say "this dawn".

56
00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:55.650
We don't say "today dawn" or "tomorrow dawn".

57
00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:57.970
It's always "at dawn".

58
00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:03.010
For example, I've got to get up at dawn to take my dad to the

59
00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:06.800
airport. I've got to get up at dawn to take my dad to the airport.

60
00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:10.790
Which means the first thing in the morning or the crack of dawn, some

61
00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:14.270
people might say, Which is that moment right when the sun is coming

62
00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:16.520
over the horizon and maybe not literally,

63
00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:18.540
They're just saying the first thing in the morning.

64
00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:20.140
Really, really, really early, Okay?

65
00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:25.600
Another example, she wakes up every morning at dawn to go for a run.

66
00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:30.230
First thing in the morning, every day she goes for a run at dawn.

67
00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:33.160
Now, next let's talk about the morning.

68
00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:37.010
Whenever we refer to this time of day, we have two options, depending

69
00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:38.100
on the context.

70
00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:43.220
So the first option "in the morning", not "on the morning", not "at

71
00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:45.970
the morning". At least not in the United States, maybe in another

72
00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:48.170
English-speaking country they might say "at the morning".

73
00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:50.740
But in the U.S, we say in the morning.

74
00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:54.850
Okay? And this just refers to the period of the day that is the

75
00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:56.210
morning.The entire period.

76
00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:59.300
For example, it never rains in the morning.

77
00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:01.540
It never rains in the morning.

78
00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:04.810
Another example, I'll see you in the morning.

79
00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:08.460
I'll see you in the morning. So again, we're talking about the

80
00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:09.790
entire period of the day.

81
00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:13.370
It's a very general way to refer to that time of the day.

82
00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:16.870
It's not specific. We're just saying it could be 7 am.

83
00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:18.710
It could be 9 am, 11 am.

84
00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:22.930
All of that is included in the period of the day we refer to as the

85
00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:26.730
morning. Okay? Now the second option is "this morning".

86
00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:30.390
Now, this morning refers to today's morning.

87
00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:33.820
So if you say this morning, you're talking about today in the

88
00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:36.030
morning, Okay? It's basically the same thing.

89
00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:37.870
We just don't say it that way. We say this morning.

90
00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:40.040
So if I say, I'll see you this morning.

91
00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:43.570
I mean, I will see you today in the morning.

92
00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:46.900
Okay? Or I could say, it rained this morning.

93
00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:50.310
I'm not talking about yesterday, I'm not talking about in general,

94
00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:53.410
Talking about today in the period of the morning.

95
00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:55.110
Okay? Cool.

96
00:04:55.190 --> 00:04:58.670
So next, let's talk about the day, or excuse me, the time of day that

97
00:04:58.670 --> 00:05:00.250
we refer to as noon.

98
00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:04.580
Now, whenever we refer to this time of day, we say "at noon".

99
00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:07.650
Okay? So in the morning, but at noon.

100
00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:13.070
All right? For example, the game starts at noon or she called me at

101
00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:16.560
noon. And both of these sentences, I'm referring specifically to 12

102
00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:19.340
o'clock pm. Not before, not after.

103
00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:24.420
All right? Now next, let's talk about the afternoon, the afternoon.

104
00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:27.510
Now, when we refer to this time of day, we also have two options,

105
00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:29.210
depending on the context.

106
00:05:29.450 --> 00:05:31.350
The first one, "in the afternoon".

107
00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:35.010
So just like we say "in the morning", we also say in the afternoon.

108
00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:38.680
This refers to that period of the day that is the afternoon.

109
00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:43.820
All right? So for example, I prefer to study in the afternoon after

110
00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:45.870
I finish working. Okay?

111
00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:49.470
Another example, I don't usually go shopping in the afternoon.

112
00:05:49.970 --> 00:05:52.760
So both of these examples, whenever we say in the afternoon,

113
00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:56.510
We're saying in general talking about that general time of day, that

114
00:05:56.560 --> 00:06:00.770
period of the day. I generally like to study in the period of the

115
00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:01.870
day that is the afternoon.

116
00:06:02.510 --> 00:06:03.540
In the afternoon, right?

117
00:06:03.910 --> 00:06:07.050
Or I generally don't go shopping in the period of the day that is the

118
00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:11.100
afternoon. Second option, "this afternoon".

119
00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:15.290
So just like this morning, we're talking about today in the

120
00:06:15.290 --> 00:06:19.780
afternoon. For example, I studied this afternoon after I finished

121
00:06:19.780 --> 00:06:23.630
working. So I worked all morning and then after I finished, I

122
00:06:23.630 --> 00:06:26.170
studied today in the afternoon.

123
00:06:26.170 --> 00:06:29.480
All right? One more example, I went shopping this afternoon.

124
00:06:30.770 --> 00:06:32.830
I went shopping this afternoon.

125
00:06:32.830 --> 00:06:34.630
Today that happened, not yesterday.

126
00:06:34.630 --> 00:06:36.110
It's not going to happen tomorrow.

127
00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:38.760
I went shopping today, this afternoon.

128
00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:40.540
All right? Cool.

129
00:06:40.610 --> 00:06:42.150
Next, let's talk about the evening.

130
00:06:42.820 --> 00:06:44.680
E V E N I N G.

131
00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:46.050
Spelled it right that time. Right?

132
00:06:46.050 --> 00:06:49.310
The evening. Again, when we refer to this time of day, we have two

133
00:06:49.310 --> 00:06:50.910
options, depending on the context.

134
00:06:51.230 --> 00:06:52.970
The first one, in the evening.

135
00:06:53.760 --> 00:06:54.820
So let me summarize again.

136
00:06:54.980 --> 00:07:00.870
In the after... No, excuse me, in the morning, at noon, in the

137
00:07:00.870 --> 00:07:03.180
afternoon and in the evening.

138
00:07:03.510 --> 00:07:08.470
All right? So just like all the others, this refers to the period of

139
00:07:08.470 --> 00:07:10.120
the day that we refer to as the evening.

140
00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:11.460
Right? That little window of time.

141
00:07:11.940 --> 00:07:16.300
So an example, I like to go for a walk in the evening.

142
00:07:17.250 --> 00:07:22.030
So in general, maybe every day, usually at this time of day, I like

143
00:07:22.030 --> 00:07:22.730
to go for a walk.

144
00:07:23.140 --> 00:07:26.590
Another example, most people watch TV in the evening.

145
00:07:27.380 --> 00:07:27.520
Right?

146
00:07:27.520 --> 00:07:30.150
They work all day. They come home, have dinner, and in the evening

147
00:07:30.610 --> 00:07:32.000
they like to relax and watch TV.

148
00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:33.590
All right? Not at the evening.

149
00:07:33.930 --> 00:07:36.260
Not all in the evening. Not around the evening.

150
00:07:37.130 --> 00:07:38.990
In the evening. All right?

151
00:07:39.080 --> 00:07:41.090
So the second option, this evening.

152
00:07:41.090 --> 00:07:43.240
Just like this morning, just like this afternoon.

153
00:07:43.920 --> 00:07:46.940
This evening. And we're talking about today specifically.

154
00:07:47.260 --> 00:07:50.850
Okay? So "in the", you can think of it that way, in the morning,

155
00:07:51.210 --> 00:07:53.890
afternoon, evening. Saying in general, right?

156
00:07:53.890 --> 00:07:57.260
This period of time. It could be 7 o'clock, 10 o'clock, 5 o'clock,

157
00:07:57.260 --> 00:07:58.410
whatever. It's just in general.

158
00:07:58.720 --> 00:08:01.560
We say "this" talking specifically about today.

159
00:08:01.720 --> 00:08:05.530
So, this evening. We went for a walk this evening.

160
00:08:06.070 --> 00:08:08.910
Today that happened. Or let's watch TV this evening.

161
00:08:09.950 --> 00:08:14.920
Right? I want this evening today, in the evening, let's watch TV.

162
00:08:14.920 --> 00:08:17.400
I'm sure you get the point. I feel like I'm over-explaining.

163
00:08:17.400 --> 00:08:19.020
I'm sure you get the point by now.

164
00:08:19.020 --> 00:08:20.360
So I'm just going to keep going. All right?

165
00:08:20.360 --> 00:08:23.710
We're almost done. Next, let's talk about the night.

166
00:08:24.270 --> 00:08:27.670
Okay? Whenever we refer to this time of day, we have a few options

167
00:08:27.670 --> 00:08:29.590
depending on the context, as always.

168
00:08:29.890 --> 00:08:32.070
But it's not in the night.

169
00:08:32.690 --> 00:08:35.060
Okay? Because we have in the morning, in the afternoon, in the

170
00:08:35.060 --> 00:08:40.300
evening. But we say "at night", we don't say "in the night".

171
00:08:40.810 --> 00:08:44.070
Now there are some specific cases there's an exception to that rule.

172
00:08:44.070 --> 00:08:47.140
Like with everything in English, you will sometimes hear somebody say

173
00:08:47.180 --> 00:08:48.510
"in the night". But that's...

174
00:08:49.490 --> 00:08:51.950
It's not common and they're very specific situations.

175
00:08:51.950 --> 00:08:56.220
So I don't want to confuse you in this episode, so I won't explain

176
00:08:56.220 --> 00:08:58.700
that right now. I'm trying to just get you the basics, the general,

177
00:08:58.700 --> 00:09:02.390
most common, Natural way that we use or that we refer to this time

178
00:09:02.390 --> 00:09:06.230
of day. All right? So back to the explanation, we say in the

179
00:09:06.230 --> 00:09:10.730
morning, in the afternoon, in the evening, but at night.

180
00:09:11.240 --> 00:09:14.790
Okay? This refers to that period of time that we refer to as the

181
00:09:14.790 --> 00:09:17.800
night, the time of day that we refer to as night.

182
00:09:18.100 --> 00:09:19.400
So here's an example.

183
00:09:20.110 --> 00:09:22.230
I do my best work at night.

184
00:09:23.350 --> 00:09:25.140
Not on night. Not in the night.

185
00:09:25.910 --> 00:09:27.050
At night. Okay?

186
00:09:27.490 --> 00:09:30.080
Another example, my city is dangerous at night.

187
00:09:31.370 --> 00:09:34.300
Okay? So maybe not all day, or maybe not all the time it's

188
00:09:34.300 --> 00:09:37.060
dangerous. But this specific period of time from, let's say,

189
00:09:37.740 --> 00:09:41.630
whenever the sun goes down, 9 pm until midnight or whatever.

190
00:09:42.120 --> 00:09:45.120
During that time at night, it's dangerous.

191
00:09:45.420 --> 00:09:48.540
Okay? Now the second option you have is "tonight".

192
00:09:49.030 --> 00:09:53.080
One word. T O N I G H T, tonight.

193
00:09:53.670 --> 00:09:56.800
That's the same thing as saying this night, although...

194
00:09:57.550 --> 00:10:00.060
And although you can say that in certain cases,

195
00:10:01.180 --> 00:10:03.580
When you're referring to specifically this night, we would say

196
00:10:03.580 --> 00:10:06.410
'tonight'. Okay? Like I said, I don't want to confuse you, just

197
00:10:06.410 --> 00:10:09.860
teaching you the basics, The general way to refer to that specific

198
00:10:09.860 --> 00:10:10.890
point in time. All right?

199
00:10:11.230 --> 00:10:12.670
So let me just give you some examples.

200
00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:18.100
We're going out tonight. I wouldn't say we're going out today at

201
00:10:18.100 --> 00:10:22.080
night. I wouldn't say we're going out on night or anything like

202
00:10:22.080 --> 00:10:26.710
that. If you're referring to today specifically, during the period

203
00:10:26.710 --> 00:10:29.690
of the day that we refer to as night, you would say "we're going out

204
00:10:29.790 --> 00:10:33.270
tonight". Which is the same thing as saying, we're going out this

205
00:10:33.300 --> 00:10:34.720
night, today specifically.

206
00:10:34.860 --> 00:10:36.320
Right? Here's another example.

207
00:10:37.100 --> 00:10:40.880
I'll see you tonight. I'll see you tonight.

208
00:10:41.390 --> 00:10:44.880
Right? I could say I'll see you today, but that indicates that I'll

209
00:10:44.880 --> 00:10:46.130
see you during the daytime,

210
00:10:46.190 --> 00:10:48.560
But we're not talking about the day, we're talking about the night.

211
00:10:48.560 --> 00:10:49.650
So I'll see you tonight.

212
00:10:49.710 --> 00:10:52.490
Not this night. I mean, again, you could say that.

213
00:10:52.770 --> 00:10:55.410
I'll see you this night. But it just sounds weird.

214
00:10:55.440 --> 00:10:56.750
It makes sense, but it sounds weird.

215
00:10:56.750 --> 00:10:58.220
We don't speak that way.

216
00:10:58.360 --> 00:11:00.930
You know what I'm saying? So I'll see you tonight, or we're going

217
00:11:00.930 --> 00:11:03.690
out to a party tonight or we're going to a bar tonight.

218
00:11:03.980 --> 00:11:08.230
Which means today, not yesterday, not tomorrow, but tonight.

219
00:11:08.930 --> 00:11:11.310
Now I know grammar lessons aren't the most interesting thing to

220
00:11:11.310 --> 00:11:12.630
listen to on a podcast.

221
00:11:12.890 --> 00:11:14.820
And maybe you think this is really basic stuff,

222
00:11:15.110 --> 00:11:17.880
But there are people out there that still make this mistake every

223
00:11:18.100 --> 00:11:19.190
single day.

224
00:11:19.490 --> 00:11:22.240
So send this to a friend that you think might find it useful so that

225
00:11:22.240 --> 00:11:25.440
you can teach them Or just remind them that we don't say today

226
00:11:25.440 --> 00:11:28.370
morning, on the afternoon, or today at night.

227
00:11:28.370 --> 00:11:32.760
We say this morning, in the afternoon, and tonight.

228
00:11:33.590 --> 00:11:36.120
Now I need to add this last explanation to the end because I

229
00:11:36.120 --> 00:11:39.010
definitely forgot about it when I was preparing for this episode.

230
00:11:39.290 --> 00:11:43.370
I forgot to mention how to talk about the past and the future when

231
00:11:43.370 --> 00:11:44.710
referring to times of the day.

232
00:11:44.820 --> 00:11:46.720
All right? So let me teach you that really quickly, because it's

233
00:11:46.720 --> 00:11:49.650
very simple. So we already know that in most cases,

234
00:11:49.650 --> 00:11:53.350
If we're talking about today we would say this morning, this

235
00:11:53.350 --> 00:11:56.660
afternoon, this evening or tonight.

236
00:11:56.990 --> 00:11:58.750
Right? So now let's talk about the past.

237
00:11:58.920 --> 00:12:02.400
If we're talking about the morning you would say "yesterday morning".

238
00:12:03.040 --> 00:12:04.070
The morning of yesterday.

239
00:12:04.190 --> 00:12:05.390
Right? Yesterday morning.

240
00:12:05.810 --> 00:12:07.680
Or the present, this morning.

241
00:12:07.680 --> 00:12:09.970
And now the future, tomorrow.

242
00:12:10.340 --> 00:12:11.670
We would say "tomorrow morning".

243
00:12:12.150 --> 00:12:13.270
Okay? Yesterday morning.

244
00:12:13.700 --> 00:12:15.440
This morning. Tomorrow morning.

245
00:12:15.850 --> 00:12:17.370
Past, present, future.

246
00:12:17.620 --> 00:12:18.690
Same thing for the afternoon.

247
00:12:19.030 --> 00:12:21.050
Yesterday afternoon, past.

248
00:12:21.550 --> 00:12:23.510
This afternoon, today.

249
00:12:24.020 --> 00:12:25.060
Tomorrow afternoon.

250
00:12:25.570 --> 00:12:28.530
Tomorrow, the future. And next is the evening.

251
00:12:28.610 --> 00:12:30.020
Right? Yesterday evening.

252
00:12:30.700 --> 00:12:32.910
This evening.Tomorrow evening.

253
00:12:33.390 --> 00:12:36.950
Same thing. Now when we're talking about the night, we do not say

254
00:12:37.160 --> 00:12:39.500
"yesterday night". Sounds really strange.

255
00:12:39.760 --> 00:12:43.930
We would say "last night", which means yesterday at night.

256
00:12:44.070 --> 00:12:46.280
That's really what it means. We don't say yesterday night.

257
00:12:46.580 --> 00:12:47.780
Okay? Last night.

258
00:12:48.450 --> 00:12:51.270
So last night, yesterday at night.

259
00:12:51.370 --> 00:12:54.320
That's what we mean. Tonight means today at night.

260
00:12:54.820 --> 00:12:57.150
Now, tomorrow we would say "tomorrow night".

261
00:12:57.790 --> 00:13:00.860
So one more time. Last night, yesterday.

262
00:13:01.430 --> 00:13:04.150
Tonight means today at night.

263
00:13:04.740 --> 00:13:06.720
Tomorrow, tomorrow night.

264
00:13:07.180 --> 00:13:08.490
Okay? Past, present, future.

265
00:13:09.170 --> 00:13:12.220
So that's Coffee with Kaizen number 18 in the books.

266
00:13:12.690 --> 00:13:14.500
And I'll talk to you tomorrow. Peace!

1
00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:06.350
We all need advice from time to time, but so many of us tend
to ask for it in such a lazy and unproductive way. So in

2
00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:10.220
this episode, I'm going to teach you the right way to ask
for advice.

3
00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:23.400
Alright, so there are four crucial things that you must do
before you ask anyone for help or advice. These things are

4
00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:28.630
even more important than actually asking for the advice. I
mean, you can't even ask for advice correctly until you've

5
00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:36.340
done the following four things. Number one, you need to know
exactly what it is that you want and you need to be as

6
00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:38.250
specific as possible.

7
00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:46.190
Right. Because there's a difference between saying, "I want
food" and "I want a double cheeseburger with extra onions,

8
00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:51.410
no pickles, and no ketchup, with french fries on the side
and a large Coke with no ice." There's a difference between

9
00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:56.590
those two things. So when you say those two things to
someone, you're going to get two different responses. And

10
00:00:56.590 --> 00:01:02.840
the more specific you are about what you want, the higher
the chance you actually get it, right? So you have to be

11
00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:10.910
specific and you have to know exactly what you want. Step
two, reverse engineer your goal. Now, when I say that, when

12
00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:17.340
I say "reverse engineer", what I mean is start with the end
goal in mind, right? Discover exactly what you want in a

13
00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:23.550
perfect world, what would happen, and once you know that,
once you have your goal, walk backwards until you reach your

14
00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:29.250
starting point. This is one of the most effective ways to
figure out where you should start when trying to achieve a

15
00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:35.760
goal or start a new project or whatever it is. Start with
the end in mind and work backwards, right? So let's say

16
00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:41.340
you're trying to run a media company, but you can't make all
the videos yourself. But that is your goal. That's exactly

17
00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:48.600
what you want - to produce videos. Well, if that's my goal,
what has to happen before I can produce these videos? I need

18
00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.360
to hire a team. Okay.

19
00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:59.590
For that to happen, what do I need to do first? I guess I
need to find talented individuals. Okay. For that to happen,

20
00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:06.390
what do I need to do first? I guess I need to create a job
posting so that they know the position is available. Right,

21
00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:13.340
okay. For that to happen, what do I need to do first? I need
to figure out which job sites I can post on to find these

22
00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:18.350
individuals. Okay. For that to happen, what I need to do
fir... You see what I'm saying? So eventually you get to the

23
00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:23.940
point where you know where you need to start. I need to
write a job description, find a job posting website, post

24
00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:29.810
the job, and find the individuals. Only then can I build a
team and start producing videos. Hopefully, that simple

25
00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:35.930
example makes sense. You start with the end in mind. Just go
back, back, back, back until you reach where you are right

26
00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:42.150
now and then you know where to start. Okay, so number one,
know what you want. Number two, reverse engineer your goal.

27
00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:51.310
Step number three, ask yourself, "what should I do?" "How
should I do it?" This is extremely important. Before you go

28
00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:57.880
ask somebody else for advice, ask yourself for advice. And
there are many reasons you should do this. The main reason

29
00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:04.420
is because many times, if you just ask yourself for the
question to the answer that you have, the answer is inside

30
00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:11.530
waiting. It's just sitting there waiting for you. But you
have to ask if you hope to receive. Every time you ask,

31
00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:15.910
you're gonna receive it. Just believe that. So you have to
ask yourself first. Another important thing is that when

32
00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:22.050
you're constantly running to other people for advice or
their opinion or asking them what you should do, you're

33
00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:28.230
constantly teaching yourself that you cannot be relied on.
You're teaching yourself that you cannot depend on yourself.

34
00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:33.700
That's why you're always running to other people for advice
or opinions or instructions or something like that. So when

35
00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:41.900
you ask yourself first, you acknowledge the fact that you
are capable of solving your own problems or at least trying

36
00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:47.080
to solve them. You see what I'm saying? And you might just
find the answer sitting in there waiting. So always ask

37
00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:54.450
yourself first what you think you should do. And a lot of
times people might do that, "okay, well, what should I do,

38
00:03:54.560 --> 00:04:00.370
self? What should I do?" And nothing comes to mind, right? I
understand that. But the point is, always ask yourself

39
00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:08.290
first. Think for yourself first. And once you realize "I
genuinely don't know, I have no idea", then go to somebody

40
00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:16.080
else and ask for advice. But before you do that, we go to
step number four. The final step is try that shit. Right?

41
00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:22.080
Know... Identify exactly what you want. Reverse engineer the
goal. Ask yourself how you should go about achieving that

42
00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:29.770
goal and taking those steps and then try it. Just try it and
see what happens. You have to experiment if you hope to

43
00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:36.100
learn, right? You got to fuck up to learn the lesson. You
can't learn without making the mistakes; you can't learn

44
00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:43.090
without trying or experimenting. So ask yourself what you
should do and then try that shit. Only after having

45
00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:50.720
completed these four steps, may you ask someone else for
advice. And now let me teach you the right way to ask for

46
00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:57.050
that advice. Step number one. Step number one is actually
not obligatory. You don't have to do this. This is just

47
00:04:57.050 --> 00:05:04.090
something that I like to do. And that step is to acknowledge
your ignorance and their expertise. When I say their

48
00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:09.910
expertise, I'm talking about the person you're asking for
advice from. You see what I'm saying? Acknowledge your

49
00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:17.140
ignorance and their expertise. Right? Acknowledge the fact
that you don't know what you need to know. And you're coming

50
00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:22.420
to them because you believe that they can help you. So it's
like, "Man, listen, I don't have any experience in this

51
00:05:22.450 --> 00:05:27.490
area. I'm not sure if this is something you would know, but
I really look up to you. I know you have experience in this

52
00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:33.250
field, so hopefully you can use your experience and
expertise to give me some advice on this thing. I really

53
00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:37.980
don't know much about it, and that's why I'm asking you,
because I feel like you are much more of an expert than me."

54
00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:43.720
Alright. Just communicating that from the very beginning
kind of sets the stage. You're acknowledging that you don't

55
00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:48.260
know shit because if you did, you wouldn't be asking
questions. You're also acknowledging that you respect and

56
00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:53.500
value their perspective or their opinion or their
experience. And people love to be flattered, right? I mean,

57
00:05:53.590 --> 00:05:59.110
it feels good when somebody says, "I feel like you're an
expert in this and I value your opinion so much that I'm

58
00:05:59.110 --> 00:06:05.820
coming to you for advice about this." That's a good thing. I
like to do it, but you don't have to. Okay, step number two,

59
00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:14.650
describe the situation or state the problem clearly and
concisely. Okay? Don't talk for 20 minutes about your

60
00:06:14.650 --> 00:06:20.820
problem without ever asking for advice, but also don't talk
for 2 seconds without giving context and information, right?

61
00:06:20.820 --> 00:06:26.980
Don't just say "I want food." You say "I want a double
cheeseburger, extra onions, no ketchup, no pickles. Medium

62
00:06:26.980 --> 00:06:32.580
fries, large coke." And obviously I'm not talking about just
food, but hopefully you can see the difference between those

63
00:06:32.580 --> 00:06:41.840
two ways of describing a problem or a situation. So describe
it clearly and concisely; give context. Okay, step number

64
00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:47.800
three, explain what you have tried in order to solve your
problem.

65
00:06:49.130 --> 00:06:56.930
Right? It's so frustrating when somebody comes to me for
advice, and not only do they not clearly explain the

66
00:06:56.930 --> 00:07:02.740
situation and what they want to happen, but then we find out
that they haven't even tried to solve their own problem yet.

67
00:07:03.410 --> 00:07:08.820
They're just trying to go to somebody else and say, "Hey,
solve my problem for me." This is not the right way to ask

68
00:07:08.820 --> 00:07:14.330
for advice. You need to explain, first of all, what the
problem is clearly, what you want to happen, and what you

69
00:07:14.330 --> 00:07:21.340
have tried, and why you think it's not working. Okay, so
that's step three. Step four, ask what they would do if they

70
00:07:21.340 --> 00:07:27.480
were in your position. Because you need to remember that
there's a difference between advice and instructions. Just

71
00:07:27.480 --> 00:07:33.550
because you go to somebody for advice and they give you some
advice doesn't mean that that's what you should do. That's

72
00:07:33.550 --> 00:07:38.040
what they would do if they were in your position. And
there's a huge difference between those two things, right?

73
00:07:38.040 --> 00:07:42.810
Because if you're constantly asking people what you should
do and just doing what other people tell you all the time

74
00:07:43.290 --> 00:07:48.910
without thinking for yourself, there's no guarantee that you
won't end up in a worse position. Right? Because if you

75
00:07:48.910 --> 00:07:55.510
didn't explain the situation clearly enough, give them
enough context, and they give you advice anyway, and you

76
00:07:55.510 --> 00:08:03.460
take that advice. Now you're taking advice that was given
based on, let's call it "vague context", based on

77
00:08:03.460 --> 00:08:10.350
something...the response is based on...like a...an
incomplete explanation of the problem. Hopefully that makes

78
00:08:10.350 --> 00:08:17.630
sense. So ask them what they would do if they were you. Now,
I want to keep this episode as short as possible, so I'm

79
00:08:17.630 --> 00:08:22.980
going to give you a real world example that happened just a
couple of days ago. I was trying to upload a video to my

80
00:08:22.980 --> 00:08:29.160
YouTube channel. It was like 49 minutes long or something
like that. It was a pretty big video. So I'm trying to

81
00:08:29.220 --> 00:08:38.970
upload it and three times in a row, I tried to upload the
video and it gets stuck on 82% uploaded. Just stuck for

82
00:08:39.080 --> 00:08:46.000
hours. It won't move. And I'm like, "Man, what the fuck is
going on?" Right? So I try on Chrome; I try on Safari.

83
00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:52.530
Nothing's working. Nothing's working. And I know just a
little bit about web development, software engineering, and

84
00:08:52.530 --> 00:08:58.320
things like that. And I have a few developer friends, so I
know just enough to have something like an intelligent

85
00:08:58.320 --> 00:09:04.740
conversation with developers. And one of my good friends,
Daniel Perez, shoutout to you, man! I sent him a message

86
00:09:04.740 --> 00:09:10.000
because I know he's a frontend developer and I'm actually
going to read you the message I sent him that involves all

87
00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:16.470
the four steps of asking for advice that I just explained to
you. So I'm pulling up the message now, give me a second.

88
00:09:18.790 --> 00:09:23.380
Alright, here we go. Here's the message I sent to him.
"What's up, bro? I don't know if this is something a

89
00:09:23.380 --> 00:09:30.070
frontend developer would know, but I've tried to upload the
same YouTube video three times now and it gets stuck at 82%

90
00:09:30.100 --> 00:09:38.240
every time. I restarted my computer, cleared my cache, I've
tried on Chrome and Safari, and nothing works. Do you know

91
00:09:38.240 --> 00:09:45.230
what might be causing this? None of the YouTube videos I've
watched have suggested anything effective." That's how you

92
00:09:45.230 --> 00:09:54.060
ask for advice. You understand? I told him what I'm trying
to accomplish. Upload the video. Right? I told him

93
00:09:55.280 --> 00:10:00.960
what I tried to solve the problem. I tried this, this, and
that, and nothing works. Now, do you know what might be

94
00:10:00.960 --> 00:10:08.080
causing this? What would you do if you were me? I've looked
at different videos, fucking forums, blog articles. Nothing

95
00:10:08.080 --> 00:10:13.270
is working. Do you know what might be causing this problem?
That's how you ask. Now he has context and he knows what I'm

96
00:10:13.270 --> 00:10:19.800
trying to do so he can better help me solve my problem. So
we go back and forth. We actually had a conversation about

97
00:10:19.800 --> 00:10:24.500
this. We're troubleshooting, trying to discover what the
problem is, and he's given me recommendations and things

98
00:10:24.500 --> 00:10:30.150
like that. And eventually, I do solve the problem. But the
point is, if I would have come to him and just said, "Hey,

99
00:10:30.150 --> 00:10:36.800
developer, I'm trying to upload this video and it keeps
getting stuck, what should I do?" What is he supposed to do

100
00:10:36.800 --> 00:10:42.340
with that information? There are so many questions he could
ask to try to discover what the right thing to do would be.

101
00:10:42.940 --> 00:10:48.830
Right? There's so many factors, so many details. But if I
clearly and concisely explain to him what I'm trying to

102
00:10:48.830 --> 00:10:56.290
achieve, what I tried and did not work, and what I want from
him, which is just advice on what I should do next or what

103
00:10:56.290 --> 00:11:02.990
might be causing this, now, he can answer my question
directly and quickly. I'm not making him do any of the work.

104
00:11:03.680 --> 00:11:09.120
I'm not making him pull information out of me so that he can
help me with my problem. When you're going to ask somebody

105
00:11:09.120 --> 00:11:17.490
for help, help them help you. You don't make them do all the
work, right? You have to make it easy for them to say yes.

106
00:11:17.490 --> 00:11:23.250
You have to make it easy for them to share their expertise
or their perspective or their knowledge with you. And you do

107
00:11:23.250 --> 00:11:24.350
that by what?

108
00:11:24.460 --> 00:11:30.950
Number one, knowing exactly what you want. Number two,
reverse engineering your own goal. Number three, asking

109
00:11:30.950 --> 00:11:38.050
yourself what you should do and how you should do it. Number
four, trying that shit. And if it doesn't work, then you

110
00:11:38.050 --> 00:11:43.940
move on to the next four steps. You acknowledge your
ignorance and their expertise, right? Number two, you

111
00:11:43.940 --> 00:11:52.590
describe the situation clearly and concisely. Don't waste
people's time. Number three, you explain what you did to try

112
00:11:52.590 --> 00:11:59.230
to solve your own problem. And number four, you ask what
they would do if they were you. If you apply this simple

113
00:11:59.880 --> 00:12:05.810
method of asking for advice, I guarantee that people will
not only be happier to give you advice or help or answer

114
00:12:05.810 --> 00:12:12.320
your questions, but you'll get better advice and better
answers to your questions. Alright? I'm by no means a

115
00:12:12.320 --> 00:12:18.470
communications expert, an advice expert, or nothing like
that, but this is just from years of talking to people every

116
00:12:18.470 --> 00:12:24.170
single day. Years of teaching English online and people
asking the same kinds of questions in the same ways. Years

117
00:12:24.170 --> 00:12:29.540
of trying to figure out how to do or achieve certain goals
in my own life, and having to ask other people for advice

118
00:12:29.540 --> 00:12:35.320
and find answers to questions. This is all based on my
personal experience. So this is not like the law. This is

119
00:12:35.320 --> 00:12:41.800
not fact. This is just my opinion and my perspective on what
I think is the right way to ask for advice.

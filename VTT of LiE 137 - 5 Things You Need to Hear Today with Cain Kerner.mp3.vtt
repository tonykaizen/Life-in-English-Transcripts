00:00:00.710 --> 00:00:06.000
Tony Kaizen:
Good morning. Good afternoon. Good evening. Shit!

2
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:14.600
How do you start the transmission fucking up, man? Let's try
that again. Good morning. Good afternoon. Good evening.

3
00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:21.590
Depending on where you are in the world. This is episode
number 137 of the Life in English podcast. I'm your host,

4
00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:23.000
Tony Kaizen.

5
00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:30.260
And in this episode, I'm going to play a clip of a man named
Cain Kerner, who has five very important things to share

6
00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:39.800
with you today. Now, Cain Kerner... Actually, let me spell
his name, C A I N, Cain, K E R N E R, Kerner.

7
00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:40.970
It's Cain Kerner.

8
00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:47.780
And you can actually search for him on Tik Tok. You can find
this video on his Tik Tok profile. I came across him on Tik

9
00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:53.210
Tok and he had this really interesting video called Five
Things You Need to Hear Today. And I thought it was very

10
00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:58.880
thought-provoking, so I wanted to share it with you today.
So as always, man, I'm going to play the clip and then

11
00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:05.630
summarize, tell you what I think and we'll get out of here,
my friend. So let's not waste any time and let's get into

12
00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:07.490
this episode. I'm going to play the clip now.

13
00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:16.100
Cain Kerner:
What's poppin'? My name is Cain, and these are five things
that you need to hear today. Let's go. Number one,

14
00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:23.210
discipline has a better attendance record than inspiration.
Number two, in order to lead the orchestra, you must turn

15
00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:30.860
your back to the audience. Number three, being more
assertive can help you to avoid being resentful. Number

16
00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:38.330
four, today is the tomorrow that you worried about
yesterday. And number five, you suffer more than necessary

17
00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:40.730
when you suffer before it's necessary.

18
00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:49.660
Tony Kaizen:
That last one was good, bro. All right. So let's go all the
way back to the beginning of the clip and I'll explain

19
00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:54.550
everything that was said. So at first, actually, let me just
play it, then I'll explain it.

20
00:01:56.290 --> 00:01:59.860
Cain Kerner:
What's poppin'? My name is Cain, and these are five things
that you need to hear today.

21
00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:06.250
Tony Kaizen:
So first he said "what's poppin'?". Now, you might have
heard this before, but "what's poppin'?" is the same thing

22
00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:12.220
as saying, What's up? There's many different variations of
the phrase "What's up?". What's poppin'? What's crackin'?

23
00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:20.520
What's good? What's happening? What's going on? You know,
there's a bunch of them. But "what's poppin'?", I mean, even

24
00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:25.230
"what's up?", I guess is considered slang. But "what's
poppin'?" is definitely slang. It's not something that

25
00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:30.650
everyone says. It just depends on where you're from and who
you grew up with. But again, it just means "what's up?". So

26
00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:35.910
if somebody says, Hey, what's poppin', bro? They just mean
what's up, in most cases. Right?

27
00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:42.630
And typically it's guys that say "What's poppin'?". I've
never in my life heard a woman say "what's poppin'?". It's

28
00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:48.330
not that it would be weird. You can obviously say it if you
want. I'm just trying to give you an idea of what this

29
00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:54.450
phrase means, who uses it and why. You know what I'm saying?
It's just typically guys say that. Everyone says what's up,

30
00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:59.940
but what's poppin'? I've never heard a woman say that. But
anyway, it just means "what's up?". So he said, What's

31
00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:04.800
poppin'? My name is Cain, and here are five things you need
to hear today. So let's go ahead and hear those five things

32
00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:05.670
one more time.

33
00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:12.940
Cain Kerner:
Let's go. Number one, discipline has a better attendance
record than inspiration.

34
00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:22.330
Tony Kaizen:
Discipline has a better attendance record than inspiration.
Now, you might have understood that the first time hearing

35
00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:30.170
it. But just in case you didn't or even if you did, let me
tell you what I think, because this is a problem I see with

36
00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:37.020
many people, myself included, I used to make this mistake
all the time. But in the context of learning English, right

37
00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:42.450
? This podcast is for English learners. You're learning
English, so I'm going to try to keep it within that context.

38
00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:44.220
Excuse me.

39
00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:52.800
So let's say you're an English learner, what a lot of people
do is they simply wait until they feel like practicing their

40
00:03:52.800 --> 00:04:00.000
English. They wait until they feel like studying English.
They wait until they feel like talking to another person in

41
00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:07.510
English. You see what I'm saying? That's... They're waiting
for inspiration. And I've talked before on this podcast

42
00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:14.230
about the difference between inspiration and motivation.
Inspiration is just that feeling where you, where you

43
00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:20.230
believe you can do anything. You have this surge of positive
energy and you can conquer the world. Right? You want to do,

44
00:04:20.230 --> 00:04:26.540
do, do. You want to take action. You feel good about it. 
That's inspiration. It comes out of nowhere. You can't

45
00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:33.460
predict it. You see what I'm saying? And just like every
other feeling, happiness or sadness, or hunger, or anger,

46
00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:38.690
inspiration comes and goes. It comes and goes.

47
00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:45.470
You cannot depend on inspiration if you're trying to get
something big and challenging done. You see what I'm

48
00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:51.470
saying? Because you never know when inspiration is going to
show up. You never know what the attendance record of

49
00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:58.530
inspiration is going to be. And just in case you don't know,
'attendance record' is the record of how often you show up.

50
00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:03.980
Like in school, if you had perfect attendance at school,
that means you showed up at school every single day of the

51
00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:10.010
year. You never missed a day. You were never absent. You
would always attend school, right? So if we go back to

52
00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:16.740
inspiration. The attendance record of inspiration is a
little shoddy, bro. It's a little... It's inconsistent. It's

53
00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:22.390
here sometimes, it's not here sometimes. It's never there
when you need it. Right? That's inspiration. Now,

54
00:05:22.410 --> 00:05:30.120
motivation is simply, in my opinion, it's the reason for
doing something. And that's why we say, What was the motive

55
00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:36.450
for that action? I think it comes from, those two words come
from the same place. Motive, motivation, motivated. It means

56
00:05:36.450 --> 00:05:42.540
that you have a good reason to do something and a reason to
do something has nothing to do with the feeling about doing

57
00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:51.070
it. You understand what I'm saying? Like, the motivation for
learning English would be to be able to travel the world and

58
00:05:51.070 --> 00:05:57.250
be able to communicate in this universal language or get a
better job or pass this English exam. There's a reason

59
00:05:57.250 --> 00:06:04.750
you're doing it. That's motivation, you understand? Not
inspiration. So getting back to Cain's point.

60
00:06:07.990 --> 00:06:17.830
I'm trying to remember the exact words he said. Discipline
has a better attendance record than inspiration. So we've

61
00:06:17.830 --> 00:06:25.740
already established that inspiration is unreliable. It comes
and goes. Right? But discipline, forcing... Not even forcing

62
00:06:25.740 --> 00:06:34.440
yourself to do something, but choosing to maintain a
productive habit over time. Essentially, that's discipline,

63
00:06:34.650 --> 00:06:41.760
right? Regardless of how you feel, regardless of how much
inspiration you have at the moment, you choose to do this

64
00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:48.570
thing even if you don't feel like it, right? Even if you
don't want to, you choose to do it because you told yourself

65
00:06:48.570 --> 00:06:53.490
that you were going to do it. You choose to do it because
you know the only way to be successful at it is doing it

66
00:06:53.490 --> 00:07:03.230
consistently. It's discipline. So by choosing to be
disciplined, you greatly increase the

67
00:07:03.230 --> 00:07:08.480
chance that you're successful, that you actually do what you
say you want to do. If you just rely on inspiration, you'll

68
00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:15.830
never fucking get it done, bro. You'll never get it done.
And that's what a lot of people have to understand is these

69
00:07:15.830 --> 00:07:21.650
big, challenging, long term goals, like learning a language,
starting a business, learning how to play the soccer, any

70
00:07:21.650 --> 00:07:30.410
skill or any project that takes long amounts of time and
large amounts of effort and energy, discipline is what gets

71
00:07:30.410 --> 00:07:33.370
you there. Consistency.

72
00:07:33.370 --> 00:07:36.800
Understanding that you're going to wake up and there are
going to be days when you don't want to do this shit,

73
00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:42.290
whatever it is, practice English, run the business, fucking
play guitar, whatever it is. There's going to be days when

74
00:07:42.290 --> 00:07:48.820
you just don't feel like it. And what most people do is say 
"Ah, tomorrow". And then tomorrow becomes next week and next

75
00:07:48.820 --> 00:07:58.030
week becomes next month, and next month becomes the next
fucking year. You understand? Like, you don't want that. I

76
00:07:58.030 --> 00:08:03.520
don't even know you and I know you don't want that. You
know what I'm saying? Do not want that. And the way you

77
00:08:03.520 --> 00:08:09.820
avoid that is discipline, consistency, showing up every
single day, regardless of whether you want to or not,

78
00:08:09.820 --> 00:08:15.690
regardless of whether you feel like it or not. Because
discipline has a better attendance record than inspiration.

79
00:08:15.690 --> 00:08:22.520
Discipline will show up every single fucking day, if you
choose for it to show up. It's on you. You understand? You

80
00:08:22.520 --> 00:08:28.670
have control over your level of discipline, but you have
zero control over your level of inspiration. So just

81
00:08:28.670 --> 00:08:32.120
something to think about. All right? But let's move on to
point number two.

82
00:08:34.270 --> 00:08:39.820
Cain Kerner:
Number two, in order to lead the orchestra, you must turn
your back to the audience.

83
00:08:41.970 --> 00:08:49.770
Tony Kaizen:
In order to lead the orchestra, you must be willing to turn
your back to the audience. I actually had to think about

84
00:08:49.770 --> 00:08:54.630
this one for a second after I heard it. I even searched on
the Internet just to make sure I understood what it really

85
00:08:54.630 --> 00:09:04.220
meant. And what I understand now when he says this, first of
all, let me explain the language because 'an orchestra'... A

86
00:09:04.220 --> 00:09:10.190
rough definition, I don't have the dictionary in front of
me, but a basic definition of 'an orchestra' is a group of

87
00:09:10.190 --> 00:09:17.400
musicians that are all playing what we call 'string
instruments'. String instruments are instruments that are

88
00:09:17.400 --> 00:09:25.530
played with strings like the guitar, the violin, the cello. 
There's a bunch of other ones I'm not familiar with, but you

89
00:09:25.530 --> 00:09:26.640
get the point.

90
00:09:26.640 --> 00:09:31.980
Instruments like that where you play them with strings, and
then an orchestra is typically like violins and cellos,

91
00:09:31.980 --> 00:09:38.930
violas. And I don't know the names of the other ones, but
you've seen that before, at least on TV or maybe in a

92
00:09:38.930 --> 00:09:43.520
theater, a giant group of people playing these instruments
and they're playing like classical music or something like

93
00:09:43.520 --> 00:09:50.090
that. That's an orchestra. So in order to lead the
orchestra, the band leader, it's not a band, it's an

94
00:09:50.090 --> 00:09:55.910
orchestra. But the leader, the one that's conducting the
show, that's one that's instructing and guiding the entire

95
00:09:55.910 --> 00:10:03.700
orchestra. Right? That person at the front. In order to be
able to do their job, they had to turn their back to the

96
00:10:03.700 --> 00:10:10.540
audience. Literally. Literally. They have to look at the
orchestra and lead them and not look at the audience and

97
00:10:10.540 --> 00:10:18.320
focus on what the audience is saying or doing or thinking. 
So if you take that and think about it metaphorically you

98
00:10:18.320 --> 00:10:26.690
can apply that really to anything in life, whether you're
the boss at a business or the team or the team captain, or

99
00:10:26.690 --> 00:10:32.560
even just in your personal life. You understand? So let's,
let's just use your life, for example. I feel like that's

100
00:10:32.560 --> 00:10:40.190
universal. The orchestra in this case would also be you.
You're, you're both the orchestra leader and the orchestra

101
00:10:40.190 --> 00:10:47.000
itself. Maybe that doesn't make sense, but just follow me
for a second. You are responsible for yourself. Let's put it

102
00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:53.800
that way. And in order to live your life. In order to 
achieve what you really want to achieve, especially if it's

103
00:10:53.800 --> 00:10:58.270
something that's less than traditional. Maybe you want to
travel the world for a couple of years when everybody else

104
00:10:58.270 --> 00:11:05.400
expects you to go to college. Everybody else expects you to
get a 9 to 5 job or something. In order to do what you

105
00:11:05.400 --> 00:11:11.340
really want to do, in order to be successful at what you
want to do, whatever that is, you have to turn your back to

106
00:11:11.340 --> 00:11:18.090
the audience, your parents, your siblings, your friends,
your co-workers, strangers on the Internet. Everybody who

107
00:11:18.090 --> 00:11:25.020
has an opinion about you and what you're doing, you can't
really focus on that. And I don't mean don't listen to

108
00:11:25.020 --> 00:11:31.770
people because even people you don't like can tell you stuff
that you need to know. Right? But I'm saying you need to be

109
00:11:31.770 --> 00:11:38.100
objective about it. And just remember that you are
responsible for yourself. No one else. Only you can live

110
00:11:38.100 --> 00:11:44.840
your life. And as a leader, you have to be able to deal with
that type of pressure and that type of criticism. People

111
00:11:44.840 --> 00:11:52.120
talking shit or disagreeing with your choices, your
lifestyle. You have to focus on the orchestra, the people

112
00:11:52.120 --> 00:11:56.560
you're trying to lead because they are depending on you to
be the leader, they're looking... Literally, the orchestra

113
00:11:56.560 --> 00:12:03.630
is looking at the leader for direction. You cannot direct
him if his back is turned to them and he's looking at the

114
00:12:03.630 --> 00:12:09.410
audience, worried about what they think. I'm sure you
understand the metaphor. And again, you can apply that to

115
00:12:09.410 --> 00:12:14.360
anything in life, bro. You're trying to start a business
with you and your friends and everybody thinks it's going to

116
00:12:14.360 --> 00:12:19.100
fail. Everybody's saying "Get a fucking job. Go to school" 
Blah, blah, blah. Turn your back to the audience and lead

117
00:12:19.100 --> 00:12:25.420
that fucking orchestra, bro. Focus on what's important. No
matter what you do in life, there will always be people who

118
00:12:25.420 --> 00:12:32.170
disagree or criticize, or tear you down. There will always
be people, I shouldn't say always, but they will probably be

119
00:12:32.170 --> 00:12:38.490
somebody who supports you as well. My point is on both
sides, you might have positive feedback and negative

120
00:12:38.490 --> 00:12:47.240
feedback. It doesn't matter. You got to focus on leading
your fucking orchestra. Nothing more. Hopefully, that makes

121
00:12:47.240 --> 00:12:52.010
sense because it's a really important point, man, especially
for young people or people of any age that are kind of

122
00:12:52.010 --> 00:13:01.780
insecure about doing things their way, living life their
way. This is an important point to understand. There will

123
00:13:01.780 --> 00:13:08.270
always be critics, man. People will always have something to
say about you and your choices. But as long as you know what

124
00:13:08.270 --> 00:13:14.700
path you're on, you're doing shit for the right reasons. 
Like, there's no reason to focus on all that shit. Just lead

125
00:13:14.700 --> 00:13:20.470
your orchestra. Who or whatever that may be, you know? All
right.

126
00:13:20.470 --> 00:13:22.360
Let's move on to point number three.

127
00:13:24.460 --> 00:13:28.600
Cain Kerner:
Number three, being more assertive can help you to avoid
being resentful.

128
00:13:32.110 --> 00:13:37.990
Tony Kaizen:
I like this one too, man. Being more assertive can help you
to avoid being resentful. Now, I want to find the dictionary

129
00:13:37.990 --> 00:13:46.250
definitions of these words before we get started. So give me
1 second. Define assertive.

130
00:13:46.270 --> 00:13:51.670
And the reason I want to get a dictionary definition of
'assertive' is because people all the time confuse the word

131
00:13:51.670 --> 00:14:00.080
'assertive' with 'aggressive'. Right? So give me a second.
Assertive. A S S E R T I V E. Assertive.

132
00:14:00.410 --> 00:14:10.330
This word means having or showing a confident and forceful
personality. Excuse me. So, and just one second,

133
00:14:10.750 --> 00:14:17.560
I want to explain I keep burping a lot because I'm drinking
a Red Bull. So it's like, I'm trying to talk and these

134
00:14:17.570 --> 00:14:22.520
fucking bubbles just keep coming up out of my stomach and I
burp. So, sorry about that.

135
00:14:22.540 --> 00:14:28.960
But anyway, assertive, having or showing confidence or
forceful personality.

136
00:14:29.470 --> 00:14:39.200
People confuse this with aggressive and let me get the
definition of that as well. Aggressive. Aggressive

137
00:14:39.200 --> 00:14:46.400
is ready or likely to attack or confront, characterized by
or resulting from aggression. So hopefully you can see the

138
00:14:46.400 --> 00:14:55.680
difference. Assertive is more about confidence and
aggressive is more about attack,

139
00:14:56.070 --> 00:14:57.560
aggression.

140
00:14:57.560 --> 00:15:04.970
A lot of... It's not always physical. But the idea is to
attack when we talk about aggression. Assertiveness is just

141
00:15:04.970 --> 00:15:07.190
to take action.

142
00:15:07.930 --> 00:15:15.280
Whatever that action may be, to take action confidently, you
know? So and the last word is resentful. Resentful.

143
00:15:18.430 --> 00:15:19.690
Resentful.

144
00:15:19.690 --> 00:15:28.200
Feeling or expressing bitterness or indignation at having
been treated unfairly. That's what resentful means. So going

145
00:15:28.200 --> 00:15:35.070
back to the point, being more assertive can help you to
avoid being resentful. The way I understood it, this point

146
00:15:35.070 --> 00:15:41.130
refers to a lot of passive-aggressive people, you know,
those type of people that clearly have something to say or

147
00:15:41.130 --> 00:15:49.200
something they want to do, but they're afraid to do it.
Because of shyness or cowardice or whatever it is, they're

148
00:15:49.200 --> 00:15:54.920
afraid to take an action or say what needs to be said. And
they just hold it for themselves. They keep it on the

149
00:15:54.920 --> 00:16:02.630
inside. And for that reason, that bitterness, that anger,
that resentment ends up manifesting itself in other ways.

150
00:16:04.040 --> 00:16:11.270
They might say something very indirect that communicates
that direct thing that they're afraid to say. They might do

151
00:16:11.270 --> 00:16:17.540
something very indirect that communicates something's wrong
or they're unhappy or they're unsatisfied. Right? That's why

152
00:16:17.540 --> 00:16:24.260
we call it passive-aggressive because you're passively
communicating your aggression instead of directly. You

153
00:16:24.260 --> 00:16:33.130
understand? And I guess what Cain is saying is by being
assertive, by confidently taking action, by saying what

154
00:16:33.130 --> 00:16:38.050
needs to be said, by saying what you're really thinking, by
communicating that your feelings were hurt, that you didn't

155
00:16:38.050 --> 00:16:42.760
like what happened, or that you need this thing or
whatever. It could be bad or good, whatever you need to

156
00:16:42.760 --> 00:16:49.510
communicate. By being assertive and communicating that
directly and clearly, you can avoid those feelings of

157
00:16:49.510 --> 00:16:55.690
resentment and bitterness, and unfair treatment. You
understand? Because when you just hold on to it, instead of

158
00:16:55.690 --> 00:17:00.940
saying it or doing it, you're really doing nothing but
poisoning yourself. And that's why people end up manifesting

159
00:17:00.940 --> 00:17:07.240
that in other ways because it starts to eat them alive on
the inside. So they have to take action. They have to say it

160
00:17:07.240 --> 00:17:13.090
or do it in some indirect way to just get it out of
themselves so they don't have to feel that way anymore. And

161
00:17:13.090 --> 00:17:18.280
what I think Cain is saying is you would never have to feel
that way if you just said what needed to be said or did what

162
00:17:18.280 --> 00:17:25.260
needed to be done from the beginning. And being assertive
and saying, You know what? I didn't like that. Or, You know

163
00:17:25.260 --> 00:17:31.330
what? I'm not going to tolerate that. By just being direct
and saying that you can avoid those feelings of resentment

164
00:17:31.330 --> 00:17:37.520
that you will inevitably feel when you choose not to say
what needs to be said or do what needs to be done, you know

165
00:17:39.010 --> 00:17:43.690
? I really hope that makes sense because it's an important
point, man. And maybe it's personal because I just really,

166
00:17:43.690 --> 00:17:49.330
really, really have a hard time tolerating 
passive-aggressive people. I really don't like them. You

167
00:17:49.330 --> 00:17:55.880
know what I'm saying? It's probably not, I mean, that's a
negative thing to say. But I just... Passive aggression is

168
00:17:55.880 --> 00:18:04.170
the weirdest thing, dog. To me, it's just cowardice. It's a,
it's a fancy term for cowardice. And I just, I don't know, I

169
00:18:04.170 --> 00:18:10.350
have a low tolerance for cowards, bro. And especially, and I
say that a lot of times I talk shit on this podcast. I can

170
00:18:10.350 --> 00:18:16.950
be critical or cynical, but things I say like that, like,
Man, I fucking hate a coward. I say that because I saw that

171
00:18:16.950 --> 00:18:23.430
in myself and I hated myself and that was something I had to
change about myself. So I'm much more understanding when I

172
00:18:23.430 --> 00:18:29.490
find it in other people these days. But still, it's just
something that it's hard to deal with. It's cowardice. It

173
00:18:29.490 --> 00:18:34.680
was hard to deal with in myself. I couldn't take it anymore,
so I had to change it. You know what I'm saying? And I guess

174
00:18:34.680 --> 00:18:40.150
that's why I don't like seeing it in other people. And
there's a quote that I'm trying to... I don't want to fuck

175
00:18:40.150 --> 00:18:47.670
it up, but it makes me think of a quote that I heard a long
time ago. And somebody said something like, When you find a

176
00:18:47.670 --> 00:18:54.950
person and there's something about them you don't like, what
you're really doing is seeing something that you don't like

177
00:18:54.950 --> 00:19:01.090
about yourself. When you find a quality in somebody that you
don't like or something that irritates you is because you

178
00:19:01.090 --> 00:19:08.720
identify with that quality. You see it in yourself. Every
person is in some way like a mirror. So when you see like,

179
00:19:08.720 --> 00:19:16.100
for example, I don't like cowardice. So when I see somebody
being a coward, some part inside me identifies with that,

180
00:19:16.100 --> 00:19:21.800
and that's why I don't like it. It's not about that person.
It's about that quality that I've found in myself at some

181
00:19:21.800 --> 00:19:27.140
point that I identify with for some reason.  And I don't
know if that makes sense to you, but when I heard that, it

182
00:19:27.140 --> 00:19:34.120
just made me think, man, that there might be some truth to
that. It's never that we don't like that specific person.

183
00:19:34.120 --> 00:19:40.740
There's a quality inside them that we identify with and we
don't like that quality. But it's not the person, you know?

184
00:19:40.740 --> 00:19:46.720
But anyway, that has nothing to do with the point that Cain
made, which is being more assertive can help you to avoid

185
00:19:46.720 --> 00:19:53.170
being resentful. Hopefully, the point made sense. If it
didn't, you know, hit me up and I'll try to clarify. But

186
00:19:53.170 --> 00:19:55.060
anyway, let's move on to point number four.

187
00:19:58.150 --> 00:20:02.440
Cain Kerner:
Number four, today is the tomorrow that you worried about
yesterday.

188
00:20:03.830 --> 00:20:08.510
Tony Kaizen:
That's another... All these points are good, man. But that's
another good one. Today is the tomorrow you worried about

189
00:20:08.510 --> 00:20:09.760
yesterday.

190
00:20:09.760 --> 00:20:13.640
And to be honest, I had to think about this one. It's a
really simple sentence, but I had to think about what it

191
00:20:13.640 --> 00:20:16.760
really means. Excuse me.

192
00:20:17.480 --> 00:20:25.240
And I guess you could interpret it multiple ways, but... 
Hang on. Geez.

193
00:20:25.330 --> 00:20:34.090
Okay. No more Red Bulls during podcasts because goddamn, I
burped, like, 15 times. But anyway, this phrase could be

194
00:20:34.090 --> 00:20:43.930
interpreted in many ways, right? I think. But today is the
tomorrow you worried about yesterday, when I hear that, I

195
00:20:43.930 --> 00:20:51.230
think that a lot of people, myself included, have a bad
habit of living in the future.

196
00:20:52.810 --> 00:20:59.890
You know, I heard recently that anxiety is simply living in
the future. You're worried about what could happen or what

197
00:20:59.890 --> 00:21:05.230
might happen. Even though it hasn't happened yet, it's in
the future, this imaginary place.

198
00:21:06.110 --> 00:21:11.210
And depression is living in the past.

199
00:21:13.250 --> 00:21:19.960
There's something in the past that you just can't let go of.
You can't walk away from it. You can't overcome it. You're

200
00:21:19.960 --> 00:21:24.880
stuck there in the past and you're depressed about it.
You're sad about something that happened that you can't

201
00:21:24.880 --> 00:21:31.940
change and you can't let go of. So living in the future is
anxiety. Living in the past is depression. So all you really

202
00:21:31.940 --> 00:21:40.970
have, the only healthy way to live is living in the present.
You know what I'm saying? And a lot of us spend so much time

203
00:21:40.970 --> 00:21:49.290
worrying about tomorrow, next week, next month, next year.
But tomorrow will never come, technically. All you have is

204
00:21:49.290 --> 00:21:54.150
the present moment. So you're worried about tomorrow,
tomorrow, tomorrow. But today is the tomorrow you worried

205
00:21:54.150 --> 00:21:56.190
about yesterday.

206
00:21:56.190 --> 00:22:01.380
So the question is, what are you going to do today? Because
yesterday you were so worried about today and now here it

207
00:22:01.380 --> 00:22:10.280
is. What are you going to do? The answer for most people is,
I'll worry about tomorrow, worry about the next day. For

208
00:22:10.280 --> 00:22:16.130
obvious reasons that's just a really bad idea, you know? But
it's a, it's a weird... It's a weird balancing act, you know

209
00:22:16.130 --> 00:22:24.880
what I'm saying? Because we have to live in the present if
we want to be, you know, healthy and happy, it's the only

210
00:22:24.880 --> 00:22:34.460
way to be. But at the same time, you have to think about
tomorrow to prepare for tomorrow. So I guess the point is,

211
00:22:34.460 --> 00:22:39.460
even though you have to think about and prepare for the
future, you need to live here in the present. Take action

212
00:22:39.460 --> 00:22:44.680
now. You know what I'm saying? So that tomorrow...

213
00:22:44.680 --> 00:22:52.430
How can I say this? Take action now so that you increase the
chances that tomorrow is a good day and not a bad day. Take

214
00:22:52.430 --> 00:22:57.740
action now so you don't have to worry about tomorrow. Do
everything you can today to make sure that tomorrow is as

215
00:22:57.740 --> 00:23:01.660
good as it can possibly be. You know?

216
00:23:01.660 --> 00:23:08.540
It's senseless to be worrying about the future all the time.
Because the future doesn't exist. All you have is right now.

217
00:23:08.540 --> 00:23:14.220
So what are you going to do right now to make a difference? 
That's all that matters because that's all you have control

218
00:23:14.220 --> 00:23:20.790
over. You know? I think that's the main point. I would love
to hear how you guys interpret this phrase, though, because

219
00:23:20.790 --> 00:23:26.880
again, I think you can interpret it more than one way. But
that's more or less what I took from it. All right? So let's

220
00:23:26.880 --> 00:23:28.020
get on to this last point.

221
00:23:29.600 --> 00:23:32.030
Cain Kerner:
Tomorrow that you're worried about yesterday.

222
00:23:32.060 --> 00:23:34.280
Tony Kaizen:
That is not the last point. Here we go.

223
00:23:35.930 --> 00:23:41.330
Cain Kerner:
And number five, you suffer more than necessary when you
suffer before it's necessary.

224
00:23:43.580 --> 00:23:50.150
Tony Kaizen:
I think this one is not a continuation of point number four,
but it's similar, right? You suffer more than necessary when

225
00:23:50.150 --> 00:23:52.910
you suffer before it's necessary.

226
00:23:54.440 --> 00:23:59.690
It's a really good one. And this one specifically, I think
is for the anxious people, the ones that are always living

227
00:23:59.690 --> 00:24:06.500
in the future. Because as a matter of fact, I'll give you an
example. One of my friends, she wants to be an au pair. And

228
00:24:06.500 --> 00:24:12.040
just in case you don't know what that is, an au pair is
basically a caregiver or a nanny or something like that,

229
00:24:12.040 --> 00:24:17.600
that will move to a foreign country and live with this
family in exchange for a place to live and food to eat and

230
00:24:17.600 --> 00:24:22.060
stuff like that. The au pair will take care of the family's
children, just like a nanny.

231
00:24:22.730 --> 00:24:29.120
And actually, I don't know what episode number it was, but I
interviewed an au pair on this podcast. So if you're

232
00:24:29.120 --> 00:24:37.080
interested in what the life of an au pair is like, then
search for the episode "The Life of an Au Pair with Alondra

233
00:24:37.080 --> 00:24:44.670
Sandoval". I don't remember the number, but it's recent, so
you'll find it. But anyway, my friend wants to be an au pair

234
00:24:44.670 --> 00:24:49.710
as well. And she joined the program, you know, years ago.

235
00:24:49.710 --> 00:24:55.140
I don't know how many years ago. And she was having a hard
time finding a family and then COVID happened. So everything

236
00:24:55.140 --> 00:25:02.490
got shut down and nobody was traveling. And then she kind
of, not gave up on the idea, but she kind of realized it was

237
00:25:02.490 --> 00:25:07.770
going to be a long time before things went back to normal
and she got a chance to meet more families and actually

238
00:25:07.770 --> 00:25:14.630
travel. So she got a job and everything and was just kind of
like waiting to see what happen. And at some point, she

239
00:25:14.630 --> 00:25:20.600
changed her destination. She wanted to come to the U.S., but
then she realized there were more opportunities in Europe.

240
00:25:20.750 --> 00:25:26.420
So she decided she wanted to go to Europe. And this whole
time we're talking about it, and she's just really nervous

241
00:25:26.420 --> 00:25:31.550
about all these things. Like, what if I can't find a family?
What if I run out of time? What if I lose the money? What if

242
00:25:31.550 --> 00:25:36.200
they don't like me? What if somebody else takes my spot?
What if this? What if that? What if that? Just worried about

243
00:25:36.200 --> 00:25:42.450
all of these things that could go wrong. Worried about all
these things that might happen or might not happen. You

244
00:25:42.450 --> 00:25:49.590
understand? She just... She was just stressing herself out.
Nobody or nothing was stressing her out. She was stressing

245
00:25:49.590 --> 00:25:59.520
herself out by worrying about all these things in this
imaginary future that might happen. Let me say that again,

246
00:25:59.520 --> 00:26:06.210
worrying about all these things that might happen. You
understand? There's a.. The list of things that might happen

247
00:26:06.210 --> 00:26:13.340
is fucking infinite. It's infinite. So by worrying about
things that might happen, you're just stressing yourself out

248
00:26:13.340 --> 00:26:19.940
for no reason. You're suffering more than necessary because
you're suffering before it's necessary. So, and I'm sure you

249
00:26:19.940 --> 00:26:26.120
understand, but just in case and for anyone who doesn't, let
me explain what that really means using that same example.

250
00:26:27.130 --> 00:26:31.180
So she's worried about all these things for months and
months and months. We're talking about it all the time.

251
00:26:31.720 --> 00:26:37.360
Finally, she finds multiple families that she likes and
families that are interested in her, and all these things.

252
00:26:37.360 --> 00:26:42.790
And she's nervous about that too. What if I choose the wrong
family? What if the family finds somebody else and I lose

253
00:26:42.790 --> 00:26:49.080
that option and blah blah blah. Worried about that too. And
at the end of it all, she finds the perfect family that she

254
00:26:49.080 --> 00:26:53.640
has a great connection with. She signs the contract. She's
going to Europe at the end of this year. Everything worked

255
00:26:53.640 --> 00:26:56.490
out. Everything.

256
00:26:59.200 --> 00:27:08.140
So all of that anxiety, all of that suffering, all that
stress that she put on herself for years was unnecessary.

257
00:27:10.400 --> 00:27:17.150
It did nothing positive for... It had no positive impact on
the result. In fact, all that shit she was worrying about

258
00:27:17.150 --> 00:27:22.190
didn't even happen. She found a family that she actually
wants to work with, in a country she actually wants to

259
00:27:22.190 --> 00:27:30.000
visit. She's learning this new language now. Everything
worked out. There was no reason to be all stressed and

260
00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:37.690
anxious about all this shit because it worked out. Right? So
she did all that suffering before it was necessary, because

261
00:27:37.690 --> 00:27:43.210
if nothing would have worked out and she would have lost her
program money and found no family and everything went to

262
00:27:43.210 --> 00:27:50.550
shit, then she would have a reason to, let's say, suffer or
be sad or disappointed. But even then, even if nothing

263
00:27:50.550 --> 00:27:57.540
worked out and everything went to shit, all that suffering
before that moment was still unnecessary. It has no effect

264
00:27:57.540 --> 00:28:02.850
on the outcome of the situation. So she suffered before
things went to shit and then she suffered after things went

265
00:28:02.850 --> 00:28:10.240
to shit. Why would you suffer twice for no reason? That's
the point. But in her case, shit actually did work out. So

266
00:28:10.240 --> 00:28:18.250
why would you suffer all that time and things worked out in
the end? It's like, What's what's the point? There's no

267
00:28:18.250 --> 00:28:24.730
reason. So sitting and worrying about what might happen,
what could happen, this or that and the third, you're

268
00:28:24.730 --> 00:28:31.330
suffering for no reason. You're putting yourself through all
this anxiety and stress before you even know what's going to

269
00:28:31.330 --> 00:28:38.140
happen. Everything might work out perfectly fine, and then
all that time and energy turns out to be wasted. You know

270
00:28:38.140 --> 00:28:42.780
what I'm saying? So...

271
00:28:42.780 --> 00:28:51.020
Hey, man, I would just say except what you can't control, do
every single thing in your power to increase the chance that

272
00:28:51.020 --> 00:28:56.180
what you want to happen actually happens. But after you do
that, you've got to sit back and accept the fact you can't

273
00:28:56.180 --> 00:29:05.960
control nothing else, bro. So why stress about it? Like,
stress has actual health implications, you understand

274
00:29:05.960 --> 00:29:13.280
? Like, just constantly being stressed and anxious has a
negative effect on your physical and mental health. You're

275
00:29:13.280 --> 00:29:21.660
choosing to feel stressed and anxious about this, You're
choosing to focus on that negativity. You're choosing to

276
00:29:21.660 --> 00:29:27.240
suffer before it's necessary. So you're choosing to fuck up
your own health just because you can't accept the fact that

277
00:29:27.240 --> 00:29:33.800
there are things you cannot control. Maybe you don't think
about it that way, but when I break it down to the essential

278
00:29:33.800 --> 00:29:36.780
idea, that's what it is. You know?

279
00:29:36.780 --> 00:29:43.370
A lot of people suffer with that, myself included. I've had
to work on it over, over time and just like, understand

280
00:29:43.370 --> 00:29:49.580
like, Shit, I really want this thing. I really want this
thing to happen or whatever. But I've done all I can do. I

281
00:29:49.580 --> 00:29:57.560
can't control anything else. I just have to exhibit faith
and patience and see what happens. And shit is just so much

282
00:29:57.560 --> 00:30:05.300
easier that way. There's no reason, there's never a reason
to suffer twice. There's never a reason to suffer before and

283
00:30:05.300 --> 00:30:11.880
after something happens. There's no reason. So, that's it,
man.

284
00:30:11.970 --> 00:30:19.040
That's it. Let me summarize these five points and we'll get
out of here, man. Number one... Is what, Tony? Number one,

285
00:30:19.040 --> 00:30:26.330
discipline has a better attendance record than inspiration.
Number two, in order to lead the orchestra, you must turn

286
00:30:26.360 --> 00:30:33.920
your back to the audience. Number three, being more
assertive can help you to avoid being resentful. Number

287
00:30:33.920 --> 00:30:42.920
four, today is the tomorrow you worried about yesterday. And
number five, you suffer more than necessary when you suffer

288
00:30:42.920 --> 00:30:45.080
before it's necessary.

289
00:30:46.460 --> 00:30:50.960

290

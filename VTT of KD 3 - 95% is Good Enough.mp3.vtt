00:00:00.940 --> 00:00:02.820
Speaker1:
95 versus 100%.

2
00:00:03.530 --> 00:00:12.810
And he tells the story of moving to around Santa Monica and
his friends getting him into biking on the bike path. So up

3
00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:20.980
and down the boardwalk right on the water. And so, being a
type-A personalities, uh, type-A personality, he would get a

4
00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:27.670
stopwatch. He'd start it and he'd like huff and puff and
race as hard as he could, all the way down to wherever and

5
00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:34.900
he would time himself. And every day, no matter how hard he
did it, 43 minutes, 43 minutes, just wouldn't improve, 43

6
00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:42.740
minutes. And this thing that should have been enjoyable
became painful in his mind. He started to avoid it. He'd be

7
00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:47.740
like, "Ah, I have other things to do. No, instead of bike
riding, I'll do this other thing." And, uh, he realized at

8
00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:54.640
one point, "This is really pathetic and this is really bad,
that something that should be enjoyable I'm avoiding because

9
00:00:54.640 --> 00:01:00.600
I've made it so painful so why don't I just go for a bike
ride and enjoy it?" So he goes for a bike ride and it's just

10
00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:08.220
a leisurely cruise. He's chilling. He's riding around and,
uh, he's seeing dolphins in the water, he's standing up,

11
00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:13.850
he's looking around, noticing things he hadn't noticed
before. At one point -- this is Derek -- he goes, "At one

12
00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:18.090
point, I looked up in the sky and there was a pelican and I
said, wow, pelican and it shit in my mouth!" (audience

13
00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:24.870
laughs) And I was like, "Ahhh!" He's like, "It was the best
bike ride ever!" I was like, "Okay." So, he's having a great

14
00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:32.630
time, uh, the pelican shit in the mouth notwithstanding. And
he gets back and he looks at his watch and it was, I think

15
00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:39.860
it was 45 minutes and he's like, "Wait, what?" He's like,
"So all that huffing and puffing, all that, like sweating,

16
00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:48.540
like leg cramps and pain was for an extra 2 minutes off the
clock?

17
00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:54.940
That's outrageous." So he started applying that to his
entire life. He said, "When I start to get really stressed

18
00:01:54.940 --> 00:02:02.490
out, I just stop. Because I realize, 95% is enough for
getting almost all of the results that I want and making it

19
00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:03.060
sustainable."

20
00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:07.290
Tony Kaizen:
95% is good enough.

21
00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:14.370
Now I don't know about you, but when I listen to this, I can
see so many similarities between this story and the stories

22
00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:19.730
of all of our lives. Anything we want to achieve in life,
any new skill we want to learn or goal we want to

23
00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:28.900
accomplish. Sometimes we have the habit of making it like,
uh, a job or a task to be completed instead of just this

24
00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:31.920
thing that we enjoy doing, you know.

25
00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:40.040
Me for example, something almost identical happened --really
the same exact thing happened-- with Life in English and the

26
00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:45.100
podcast and everything, you know? The past couple of months
I just found myself getting to this point where it really

27
00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:49.820
felt like a job for the first time, I guess ever.

28
00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:56.080
I can't remember ever thinking before, this feels like a job
that needs to be done as opposed to this is just what I

29
00:02:56.080 --> 00:03:01.640
enjoy doing, so I'm gonna do it. And that's one of the
dangers I think of trying to take something you're

30
00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:08.450
passionate about or something you enjoy and turning it into
a way to make money because then it... it stops being a

31
00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:16.020
hobby and it becomes something like a business to where
you're doing this because you expect or hope or plan to

32
00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:24.930
receive money for it. And so with me, I started the Life in
English membership.

33
00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:29.470
I was trying to think of how to build a membership business
around Life in English and all the content that I'm

34
00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:38.460
producing because that's really like my zone of genius is
content creation, creative activities, um, communication in

35
00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:43.640
general. Not to say I'm a communication genius, but that's
what comes naturally. That's where I don't need any help. I

36
00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:49.350
don't need any instruction. I just work intuitively and shit
just happens. That's what I mean when I say that's my zone

37
00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:51.670
of genius. And so...

38
00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:58.800
with the podcast, like the whole time before I started the
membership, it really was, I just like doing the shit. I

39
00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:05.720
don't know. I got a lot to say, man, and on a podcast I can
just express myself without worrying about boring the other

40
00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:11.990
person or giving them a chance to speak or, you know, being
worried about the words I choose and things like that

41
00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:19.330
because I'm just talking to myself. I'm just in this room as
we speak or as I speak. I'm in this room just talking to a

42
00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:26.760
microphone. And I just really enjoyed it. But then, you
know, it got to this point, leaving my personal life out of

43
00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:32.090
it, I just got to this point in my life where it's like,
okay, I need to basically double down on something and

44
00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:39.070
decide how am I going to make a living? How am I going to,
like, support myself, what kind of work am I gonna do? What

45
00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:44.690
type of work can I do? What type of work would I enjoy? And
then just after looking at everything, Life in English was

46
00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:51.330
the obvious answer. I'm gonna try and turn this into a legit
revenue stream. Just get paid to do something that not only

47
00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:59.610
I enjoy, but thousands of people actually find valuable and
benefit from. That's Life in English. So, I started the

48
00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:06.440
membership thing thinking, "Damn, I've got tens of thousands
of people following me on this platform, millions on that

49
00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:14.080
one, hundreds on that one." If, you know, 10% of all the
people who know and follow what I do just gave me 5 bucks a

50
00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:21.970
month, like, we could scale this into a legit education
company where I'm hiring multiple employees to help me

51
00:05:21.970 --> 00:05:27.970
produce more, you know, invest and execute on more ideas and
things of that nature. But obviously, you know, nobody

52
00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:33.260
really gives a shit about me or Life in English or what I'm
trying to accomplish so it didn't really work that way. But

53
00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:39.860
that's not the point. The point is, ever since I started
trying to turn it into some kind of membership business

54
00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:47.920
where we're able to grow because of the membership revenue
we receive, slowly but surely at just... the stress level

55
00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:53.080
started to increase and the way I thought about all the
content I was producing started to increase. I started

56
00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:59.840
making really, really dumb, shortsighted decisions because I
was thinking about money or short-term gains and not about

57
00:06:00.100 --> 00:06:07.920
the...the content, the...the...the substance of it all and
the long-term vision. I started to neglect that. And it just

58
00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:14.260
got to this point where I...I was producing content just
because I felt like I had to. The only way people are gonna

59
00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:19.980
know about me and what I'm doing and then, you know, begin
to support and join the community is if I'm constantly

60
00:06:19.980 --> 00:06:25.740
putting out content, constantly putting out things for
people to consume and you kind of end up on like this

61
00:06:25.740 --> 00:06:30.270
hamster wheel where you're just running, running, running,
running, running, but you never get to the fucking finish

62
00:06:30.270 --> 00:06:36.010
line. It just never stops. And the minute you stop putting
in effort, the wheel stops turning, you see what I'm saying?

63
00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:42.750
So I just put this --voluntarily put this-- pressure on
myself, like I need to be putting out content. An episode

64
00:06:42.910 --> 00:06:49.880
every week, three or four videos every day. Blog posts and a
newsletter and this and that, I need to, you know, conquer

65
00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:55.900
the world fucking yesterday. Because I have all these dreams
and aspirations and visions and things I would like to do

66
00:06:56.440 --> 00:07:02.720
with this project. But, you know, I'm only one person, you
know, you can only do so much, especially when it's not your

67
00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:09.580
full time job. It's like a side project you're trying to
turn into a full time job. So with all that being said, my

68
00:07:09.580 --> 00:07:17.990
point is, I got to this...this...this place where even
sitting down to write a podcast episode was stressful.

69
00:07:19.190 --> 00:07:25.540
Because I'm...I'm considering so many other things besides
just writing the fucking episode or recording it. I'm

70
00:07:25.540 --> 00:07:31.870
thinking about branding and marketing and the subject matter
and, you know, even when I sit down and try to write and

71
00:07:31.870 --> 00:07:36.540
just focus on the topic at hand, I'm thinking about all this
other business stuff. I'm thinking about the community and

72
00:07:36.540 --> 00:07:42.850
my students and my personal life and fucking money and
budgeting and future plans and, you know, these multiple

73
00:07:42.850 --> 00:07:50.080
projects I'm trying to work on and finish. It just became
way too much for one person to manage, you know? I mean,

74
00:07:50.080 --> 00:07:54.040
you're trying to do a bunch of things and you're thinking
about a bunch of things at the same time, you end up doing

75
00:07:54.040 --> 00:07:59.660
nothing, which just adds to the stress. And you're like,
"No, fuck, I need to focus and get this done bah, bah, bah."

76
00:08:00.070 --> 00:08:06.280
And then you try to sit down and get it done and you can't
focus, you can't relax and just enjoy the shit, you know?

77
00:08:06.280 --> 00:08:12.890
And that's when I really had to stop and... and take ten
steps back. And really analyze like what am...what am I

78
00:08:12.970 --> 00:08:20.670
doing? What are my goals here? Why am I doing this? What
exactly am I trying to achieve? And how is my current method

79
00:08:22.540 --> 00:08:29.220
helping me achieve those things or keeping me from achieving
those things? I really had to stop and consider that. And

80
00:08:29.220 --> 00:08:33.960
that's why recently I made those changes to Life in English,
to the community and everything, because I just had to set

81
00:08:33.960 --> 00:08:40.800
it up in a way where it's more like back to the way it used
to be. Where I'm just producing the stuff I want to produce

82
00:08:40.800 --> 00:08:46.430
or that I know my audience --you in this case-- would like
to hear or learn about or you might be interested in and

83
00:08:46.430 --> 00:08:54.830
that kind of thing, and just let go of this false idea that
I just constantly need to be producing, I constantly have to

84
00:08:54.830 --> 00:09:01.470
be making things or like doing shit, especially the shit
that doesn't really make a difference in the project or your

85
00:09:01.470 --> 00:09:10.340
life or my life at all, you know? I had to kind of just slow
down and learn how to enjoy the process again. Which is why

86
00:09:10.340 --> 00:09:15.670
now I've kind of taken that pressure off myself and I don't
feel the need to put out an episode every week or be on

87
00:09:15.670 --> 00:09:22.060
social media every day -that shit is not healthy, first of
all. It's not sustainable, second of all. And I just don't

88
00:09:22.060 --> 00:09:29.470
fucking like it, most of all,(laughs) you know what I mean? 
So it's just like, what... what I'm trying to...the message

89
00:09:29.470 --> 00:09:36.200
I'm trying to get across to you is no matter what it is in
life, you know, you have to...let me think about how to say

90
00:09:36.200 --> 00:09:43.730
this. If you're gonna try to work for yourself, if you're
gonna try to make a living doing something that's

91
00:09:43.760 --> 00:09:52.410
unconventional or build a business around your passions and
things like that, you have to set it up in a way that

92
00:09:52.410 --> 00:09:58.150
enables you to continue enjoying it even after it becomes a
business and you have all these other responsibilities

93
00:09:58.190 --> 00:10:04.040
otherwise it's not... it's not gonna be sustainable, you
know? You might get the business part perfect, but then

94
00:10:04.040 --> 00:10:09.040
your...your... the passion part suffers. Or if you only
focus on the passion, then the business part suffers. So

95
00:10:09.040 --> 00:10:16.820
it's really important to find a balance and create a
structure that works for the...the grand vision you have for

96
00:10:16.820 --> 00:10:23.150
not only that project or career, but your life in general,
your daily experience, you know what I mean? And it's a

97
00:10:23.150 --> 00:10:30.310
weird balancing act that you have to find when you're trying
to mix passion with business, you know? Art and money. It's

98
00:10:30.310 --> 00:10:36.270
a weird balance you got to find, man, to where you can
successfully execute on both without getting burnt out,

99
00:10:36.330 --> 00:10:43.500
without feeling like your business is suffering, or the art
or the passion side is suffering. It takes time and you got

100
00:10:43.500 --> 00:10:49.020
to bump your head on a lot of walls and fucking make tons of
mistakes. I mean, the number of mistakes I've made in the

101
00:10:49.020 --> 00:10:55.910
last year, man, (sighs) I probably...that...that deserves
its own episode, you know what I mean? I won't even get into

102
00:10:55.910 --> 00:11:03.820
it now. But the point is, I've learned so much this past
year since I really launched the Life in English project

103
00:11:04.240 --> 00:11:11.270
with the intention of making enough money to then reinvest
in the project and make it grow. This past year has been

104
00:11:11.270 --> 00:11:16.650
nothing but countless learning experiences. But getting back
to the point of the clip that I played at the beginning and

105
00:11:16.650 --> 00:11:24.690
what I started talking about, I just had to learn to enjoy
the process, man. And it's funny because the episode "Five

106
00:11:24.750 --> 00:11:31.260
Traits of a Great Communicator" that I put out recently,
that was the first episode in a long time where I said, "I

107
00:11:31.260 --> 00:11:37.250
don't give a fuck about anything else except writing the
episode." I don't care how long it takes. I don't care how

108
00:11:37.250 --> 00:11:44.730
long the episode ends up being. I don't give a fuck about
nothing but the subject at hand and me writing down what I

109
00:11:44.730 --> 00:11:52.480
think and getting my message across to you -the listener. 
And just like in the story from the clip that I played at

110
00:11:52.480 --> 00:12:01.710
the beginning of this episode, when I finished that episode,
I realized, "Damn, the first paragraph, it took me four or

111
00:12:01.710 --> 00:12:07.460
five days to write." Because I'd sit down I'm like, I
couldn't focus on the subject. I couldn't focus on that

112
00:12:07.500 --> 00:12:14.910
episode. I was thinking about so much other shit. And then,
the following week, when I decided I'm just gonna enjoy it

113
00:12:14.910 --> 00:12:19.770
and write the episodes the way I used to, I'm not gonna
think about anything but the episode and what I want to say.

114
00:12:20.440 --> 00:12:29.200
Bro, the last four, (laughs) the last four paragraphs or
chapters or parts of that episode- I did in the same day. I

115
00:12:29.200 --> 00:12:37.660
wrote all of it in one sitting. Took me like an hour at
most. So it's just so funny how like I identify completely

116
00:12:38.490 --> 00:12:46.470
with the story in this episode to where you...where you just
take the stress off yourself and just enjoy the shit. Just

117
00:12:46.470 --> 00:12:50.760
enjoy the shit. Enjoy the process.

118
00:12:50.760 --> 00:12:58.200
Just go through it, step by step without worrying about
anything else. Oftentimes you realized not only did you

119
00:12:58.200 --> 00:13:02.400
enjoy it more, but you did it better. And quicker.

120
00:13:02.520 --> 00:13:07.900
You know, all that shit you were stressing about was
imaginary you put on yourself, bro. So I think there are

121
00:13:07.900 --> 00:13:13.260
times when you need to go hard. It's not about enjoying
yourself per se. It's more about getting shit done,

122
00:13:13.330 --> 00:13:18.530
especially when money is involved or people are depending on
you. You have to execute. And that's something I'm learning

123
00:13:18.930 --> 00:13:25.690
day by day is how to go from creative ideas to realistic
execution, because otherwise you have no fucking business.

124
00:13:25.690 --> 00:13:33.220
You have no...you know what I mean? You need both. But. But.
There's this... there's a phrase that we have in English,

125
00:13:33.220 --> 00:13:40.790
which is "Work hard, play hard." And I think sometimes it's
important to remember you should be playing just as hard as

126
00:13:40.790 --> 00:13:48.400
you work. So if this activity is meant to allow you or help
you enjoy yourself, fucking enjoy yourself, bruh. The

127
00:13:48.440 --> 00:13:53.960
stress, the problems, the misunderstandings, the confusion,
the doubts, all that shit will be there when you finish,

128
00:13:54.490 --> 00:14:03.590
trust me. But if it's time to enjoy yourself or just do this
thing, just focus on doing the thing. Time is not real. I'd

129
00:14:03.590 --> 00:14:10.390
let it go, bruh. Don't worry about it. Just fucking enjoy
the process, man. And I guess for you, something more

130
00:14:10.390 --> 00:14:15.340
relevant would be like learning English, for a lot of
people, I'm sure they could relate. Or let me say that

131
00:14:15.340 --> 00:14:21.530
differently. I'm sure a lot of people could relate to this
story in terms of learning any language, but in this case,

132
00:14:21.530 --> 00:14:27.380
English, you know, because you put so much pressure on
yourself, "I got to get this job, change careers, I want to

133
00:14:27.380 --> 00:14:33.890
beat the competition. I want to be the most qualified. I
have to ..." "I need to learn 30 days, 60 days, 90 days. I

134
00:14:33.890 --> 00:14:40.210
must improve my English. I must learn." And all that time
you spend just saying that shit, you could be actually just

135
00:14:40.260 --> 00:14:46.060
improving your English. But since you're not and you're just
focused on "I have to do, I have to do, I'm obligated." Then

136
00:14:46.060 --> 00:14:55.490
it becomes this task, this fucking chore, this job that must
be done instead of something that I just want to do. Any

137
00:14:55.490 --> 00:15:01.690
time you feel obligated to do something that you don't feel
you want to do, you're gonna do it with less passion, less

138
00:15:01.760 --> 00:15:03.180
energy, you know?

139
00:15:03.350 --> 00:15:10.000
You're not gonna try as hard. It's just gonna be a much more
miserable experience for you. And that's what happens to a

140
00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:17.470
lot of people. It...It becomes this... this dark cloud just
hanging over their heads all the time and they know they

141
00:15:17.470 --> 00:15:22.850
need to get it done but, "Ah, you know, tomorrow." or "I
don't have anyone to speak with." or "It's too hard." "I'm

142
00:15:22.850 --> 00:15:28.790
not smart enough." "I'll try again next month." You know? "I
don't need it right now." All this bullshit that we tell

143
00:15:28.790 --> 00:15:37.050
ourselves to convince ourselves that this important thing we
know needs to be done could probably wait. I'm sure we've

144
00:15:37.050 --> 00:15:44.310
all done it at some point in life. And what I find is or
excuse me, what I've found is that the people who just enjoy

145
00:15:44.310 --> 00:15:50.330
the shit, just show up in the community and just talk to
people who ask their questions, who try to live their lives

146
00:15:50.330 --> 00:15:57.610
in English and just take it day by day, they have so much
more fun. They make so much more progress. You know what I

147
00:15:57.610 --> 00:15:59.620
mean? It's weird.

148
00:15:59.620 --> 00:16:06.170
It's almost like... It's almost like when you stop caring,
that's when shit starts to work for you, you know what I

149
00:16:06.220 --> 00:16:11.750
mean? When you stop putting so much pressure on yourself
and...and building it up to be this grand, you know,

150
00:16:11.840 --> 00:16:16.910
overwhelming thing, and you just say, "Oh, fuck it, I'm just
going to do it. Whatever happens, happens." Then shit starts

151
00:16:16.910 --> 00:16:22.900
to work for you. It's weird. It's really weird. So the
message I'm trying to get across to you, after all this,

152
00:16:22.900 --> 00:16:29.390
man, is no matter what it is in life, just like the men in
this story, I encourage you to learn how to just enjoy the

153
00:16:29.480 --> 00:16:32.540
process, man. Enjoy the process.

154
00:16:32.540 --> 00:16:39.470
Let go of these... these imaginary ideas, these false ideas
that you have that shit has to be done by a certain day, at

155
00:16:39.470 --> 00:16:46.300
a certain time and a certain way. In some cases that's true.
But in many cases, man, especially when acquiring skills or

156
00:16:46.300 --> 00:16:51.750
just, you know, doing fun activities, trying to get better
at things like bro, by putting that pressure on yourself,

157
00:16:53.020 --> 00:17:01.580
you're just making it harder on yourself and there's no
reason to do that, you know? So, if you take away anything

158
00:17:01.580 --> 00:17:07.660
from the story at the beginning of this episode or anything
I've said is no matter what it is in life, man, just at

159
00:17:07.660 --> 00:17:15.070
least try to remember to enjoy the process, because all we
have is the present moment. All we have is right now. And if

160
00:17:15.070 --> 00:17:22.500
you can't enjoy what's happening right now, how the fuck are
you gonna enjoy, you know, the end result? How are you even

161
00:17:22.500 --> 00:17:29.420
gonna get there? Even if you get there one day, the whole
journey, all you're gonna remember is misery and difficulty

162
00:17:29.710 --> 00:17:38.650
and fucking sadness and pain and stress. Why...you know? I'm
just saying there's no reason to put extra stress on

163
00:17:38.650 --> 00:17:43.700
yourself. Stress is natural. I think it's normal. I think
it's healthy. It's how you know that you're outside of your

164
00:17:43.700 --> 00:17:49.430
comfort zone. And that's where real growth happens. But
there's no reason to put more pressure on yourself than what

165
00:17:49.430 --> 00:17:55.650
is absolutely necessary. I guess that's what I'm trying to
say. And by just enjoying the process, yeah, it's hard, it's

166
00:17:55.650 --> 00:18:01.090
challenging, it's gonna take a while but at least I'm
enjoying myself. And when you enjoy yourself, you do it

167
00:18:01.130 --> 00:18:09.400
better with more passion, more happiness, which typically
brings better results, right? Super simple stuff that I

168
00:18:09.400 --> 00:18:14.980
think we just forget sometimes because we're lost in the
hustle and bustle of our daily lives and we have these goals

169
00:18:14.980 --> 00:18:20.000
and we want to achieve them. And then we go online and we
see people who appear to be achieving their goals. And it's

170
00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:25.970
like, "Fuck, I got to go harder, I got to try harder, I got
to do this and that." And again, sometimes it's true but you

171
00:18:25.970 --> 00:18:33.270
got to find that balance, man. Got to find that balance. So
anyway, I just wanted to put that on your mind today. Leave

172
00:18:33.270 --> 00:18:38.500
you with something to think about. If you'd like, do not
hesitate to start a conversation on Discord and let me know

173
00:18:38.500 --> 00:18:44.170
what you think about it, man. But this is Kaizen after Dark.
I am your host, Tony Kaizen, and I'll talk to you soon.

174
00:18:44.890 --> 00:18:45.190
Peace!

00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:01.020
What's up, my friend?

2
00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:03.000
This is Coffee with Kaizen number 31.

3
00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:08.580
And I want to take this time to update you on a few things happening here at Life in English. All right?

4
00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:11.610
So let me update you because I'm about to upgrade you.

5
00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:26.270
So my friend, I've been watching a lot of videos and listening to podcasts about

6
00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:29.810
How to build the community and how to run a successful membership business

7
00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:35.510
Because at the end of the day, that's what Life in English aspires to be at the moment. You know?

8
00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:39.230
A creative education platform that provides the content, community,

9
00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:42.050
and support you need to learn English and grow as a person.

10
00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:48.170
Now, the way the business is attempting to sustain itself is with the subscription revenue of its members.

11
00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:52.480
In other words, we charge a monthly fee for access to our podcasts and services.

12
00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:56.420
And that way Tony Kaizen can pay all his bills, his employees,

13
00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:58.790
His business expenses, taxes, et cetera.

14
00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:04.910
And then take the rest of that money and reinvest it into the business so it can grow and improve even more rapidly.

15
00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:06.500
That's the basic idea here.

16
00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:10.700
But here's the thing I noticed that although the content I make is valuable,

17
00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:14.750
It's not necessarily the most valuable aspect of what I'm offering.

18
00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:18.310
Because you can find podcasts anywhere. You can listen to my podcast for free.

19
00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:22.010
You can find millions of videos on YouTube or buy a bunch of courses.

20
00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:24.680
You can even look for a language exchange partner for free.

21
00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:26.870
But we all know how difficult that can be.

22
00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:30.350
And it seems to me that the one thing that everyone needs

23
00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:35.750
But doesn't have is a high-quality community of people who all have the same genuine intentions

24
00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:42.140
And objectives to practice more of their English and to become fluent in English and also make some friends while they do it.

25
00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:47.450
So the real value of this Life in the English project is the community itself.

26
00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:51.740
And I noticed that even though the quality of my work is good and it's improving every day,

27
00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:55.940
The quality of the community and its culture need a major improvement.

28
00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:58.160
So getting back to my point,

29
00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:03.020
I've been consuming a lot of information about how to build a great community that people want to be a part of,

30
00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:09.290
As well as creating a sustainable business model so that I can support myself and do this work full time.

31
00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:16.520
Now, the search for this knowledge led me to realize that there are a lot of things about the Life in English membership that I can improve.

32
00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:20.070
Number one, my sales page.

33
00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:26.490
And one thing I noticed is that I've done a pretty poor job of explaining the true value of the Life in English VIP membership

34
00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:32.730
Because in my mind, access to hundreds of podcast episodes with interactive transcripts and vocabulary guides

35
00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:37.410
That teach and explain real English and a community of language exchange partners,

36
00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:45.900
Plus a native English-speaking teacher and private lives study events all for ten dollars a month sounds like a no-brainer. Right?

37
00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:51.510
Like if I was learning a foreign language and I had access to everything that I'm offering here at Life in English for ten bucks,

38
00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:56.210
I mean, how could you not - especially if you support that teacher and their mission and you,

39
00:02:56.220 --> 00:03:02.070
You know, you identify with the way that they teach and you really get value from the things that you've learned from them.

40
00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:04.710
It's like, how could you not support? You know what I'm saying?

41
00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:11.510
I guess the point is if I would pay that much money for, you know, just basic entertainment like Netflix,

42
00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:17.060
Then I would definitely pay that much money for my education. That's really what I'm trying to say.

43
00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:20.780
But I think a lot of people don't even really know what Discord is or how it works.

44
00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:25.580
I also think I don't talk enough about the private conversation group and how it works.

45
00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:30.200
Because the Discord server is literally the solution to every intermediate English learner's problem.

46
00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:35.290
I can understand spoken English, but I have no one to speak with, so I can't speak well.

47
00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:39.520
Well, now you've got a place where you can practice with real people any time you want.

48
00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:47.200
So I think I need to do a better job of communicating the value of each of the membership benefits and also give examples of them being used.

49
00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:52.450
I think this will convince a lot more people to at least give the community a try. You know?

50
00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:57.280
Because when you can see how something works, you can start to imagine yourself using or doing that thing,

51
00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:00.580
Which makes it much easier to actually try it. You see what I'm saying?

52
00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:08.100
So another thing, number two that I think can really use some improvement is what we call the onboarding process.

53
00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:11.950
So, you know, once we convince someone to join the community,

54
00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:16.360
They need to be welcomed into the community so that they feel like they belong here. Right?

55
00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:21.690
Well, how have I been making all that happen up until this point?

56
00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:25.350
Sending a fucking email with four main points you need to know about the membership.

57
00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:30.360
No video, no phone call, no instruction manual, nothing.

58
00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:35.340
And this approach works well enough because you obviously were able to join and figure things out,

59
00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:38.460
But a new member of a community needs to be oriented.

60
00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:44.370
They need to know where to start, how to start, and they want to experience the dynamics of the community.

61
00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:49.050
That's impossible for me to facilitate that process with a fucking email. You know what I'm saying?

62
00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:55.050
So I'm working on a process that will help a new member integrate into the community in just a few simple steps.

63
00:04:55.860 --> 00:05:01.530
First, I have a welcome video with me thanking them for joining and letting them know that they made the right decision.

64
00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:06.780
Next, I'll teach them how to use the website and all its features on both the computer and a smartphone.

65
00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:11.550
Because some people use one or the other or both. And then I'll do the same thing for Discord.

66
00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:15.750
Show them how to use it on a desktop. How to use it on the mobile phone, right?

67
00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:19.740
And finally, I'll give them some recommendations on how to actually get started.

68
00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:25.200
For example, how to introduce yourself to the community, how to approach other members for a conversation,

69
00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:29.820
Or how to share your own interests and culture with the community, how to use the transcripts

70
00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:35.580
And the vocabulary guides and the animated captions, and all those things properly. You know?

71
00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:42.060
The idea is to get them using the Premium features as fast as possible because once you experience all the benefits of this membership,

72
00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:45.330
It's really hard to say that it's a waste of money, in my opinion.

73
00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:51.690
So when a new member can quickly see that I'm not like, you know, a scammer selling some bullshit and that it's,

74
00:05:51.690 --> 00:05:55.830
you know, this membership is actually going to help them improve their English,

75
00:05:55.830 --> 00:06:00.870
They're much more likely to stay and really invest themselves into the community and their education,

76
00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:04.020
Which makes the community better for everyone. You see what I'm saying?

77
00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:13.680
So the third thing I think can really use some improvement is creating and or providing resources for students to self learn, right?

78
00:06:14.750 --> 00:06:23.270
So another thing I noticed is that most members in the group will only get online and interact if I'm online interacting,

79
00:06:23.930 --> 00:06:27.320
And I can understand that because a lot of people are shy and they don't have much skill

80
00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:32.060
When it comes to getting to know new people or keeping a conversation going with a stranger. Right?

81
00:06:32.420 --> 00:06:37.850
But you've got to remember that the goal is to have thousands of members in this community interacting all the time.

82
00:06:38.810 --> 00:06:42.800
I can't always be there to facilitate every group discussion.

83
00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:45.190
Especially right now, because I'm not able to do this full time.

84
00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:49.400
So there are days when I simply can't be online to chat. You feel me?

85
00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:54.200
But I also had to remember that everyone in this community is here because of me.

86
00:06:55.070 --> 00:06:57.710
Everyone is naturally looking to me for a direction.

87
00:06:57.710 --> 00:07:02.450
So my plan is to create some type of or actually multiple resources that will help people

88
00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:07.490
Get better at introducing themselves to strangers and making conversation with them.

89
00:07:07.490 --> 00:07:13.520
Because I'm here to support you, but part of that support is teaching you how to support yourself. You see what I'm saying?

90
00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:18.620
So anyway, some ideas I have for useful resources are things like

91
00:07:18.620 --> 00:07:22.820
Simple guides on how to improve your communication skills and have better conversations.

92
00:07:22.820 --> 00:07:29.000
In other words, how to share yourself with other people and encourage them to share themselves with you. Right?

93
00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:32.510
Also lists... Some type of creative list. I'm not sure how I'm going to do it,

94
00:07:32.510 --> 00:07:38.660
But an interesting and creative way to share interesting conversation topics or debate topics. You know?

95
00:07:38.660 --> 00:07:44.780
Things that you can use to get conversations started or keep them going when you're trying to do a language exchange with somebody

96
00:07:44.780 --> 00:07:49.310
And maybe you run out of things to say or you get stuck in the conversation, things like that.

97
00:07:49.310 --> 00:07:54.830
Just little tips and tricks that you can use to keep the conversation going or take the conversation in a different direction.

98
00:07:54.860 --> 00:07:56.340
You see what I'm saying?

99
00:07:56.340 --> 00:08:01.850
And I also want to find other ways to help people or encourage people to stay active on the Discord server.

100
00:08:01.850 --> 00:08:05.630
Even if you don't have always... you don't have always?!

101
00:08:05.630 --> 00:08:09.170
Even if you don't always have time to talk. You see what I'm saying?

102
00:08:09.170 --> 00:08:11.570
Because I understand people are busy or they have different schedules,

103
00:08:11.570 --> 00:08:16.220
But that doesn't mean you cannot be involved on the server.

104
00:08:16.220 --> 00:08:21.980
You can still interact every day, even if you don't have all the time in the world to talk every day. You know?

105
00:08:21.980 --> 00:08:27.950
And I also want to find a way to create some type of search engine or directory that would recommend music,

106
00:08:27.950 --> 00:08:34.430
Movies, books, series, content in general based on your current English level and your personal interests.

107
00:08:35.310 --> 00:08:38.010
But I have no idea how that would work, exactly.

108
00:08:38.010 --> 00:08:41.640
So if you know any talented web developers, please let me know. You know?

109
00:08:41.640 --> 00:08:46.680
I'm going to eventually reach out to my developer friends at some point to see how something like that would be built.

110
00:08:47.760 --> 00:08:51.120
But one thing at a time, right? One thing at a time, my friend.

111
00:08:51.120 --> 00:08:56.340
And that takes me to my next point of improvement, which is facilitating community events.

112
00:08:56.970 --> 00:09:02.430
Now it's going to take some time to teach people the culture that I'm trying to create here at Life in English.

113
00:09:02.430 --> 00:09:07.770
So in the meantime, while the community is still in its infancy growth stages,

114
00:09:07.800 --> 00:09:11.340
One thing I'm going to start doing is hosting live events for the entire community,

115
00:09:11.370 --> 00:09:13.860
Maybe once a month or every two weeks or every week.

116
00:09:13.860 --> 00:09:17.040
It just depends on everyone's schedule, including mine,

117
00:09:17.040 --> 00:09:19.860
and the type of events that we're going to have. You see what I'm saying?

118
00:09:19.860 --> 00:09:21.690
But we can watch movies and videos together.

119
00:09:21.690 --> 00:09:24.360
We can listen to music together and have discussions about it.

120
00:09:24.390 --> 00:09:28.020
I can host group discussions in which we pick a particular subject

121
00:09:28.020 --> 00:09:34.530
And talk about it extensively in order to increase vocabulary and comprehension and public speaking skills.

122
00:09:34.530 --> 00:09:38.580
Which actually takes me to the next idea, which is doing something like Toastmasters.

123
00:09:38.970 --> 00:09:42.030
And just in case you don't know what that is, it's like this organization,

124
00:09:42.030 --> 00:09:46.980
This network of people who all have the common goal of getting better at public speaking.

125
00:09:46.980 --> 00:09:52.980
So at a Toastmasters event, you would go meet these people in this public place and

126
00:09:53.190 --> 00:09:57.780
You might have a subject that you need to talk about in front of this group of like 30 or 40 people.

127
00:09:57.870 --> 00:10:03.980
And the whole idea is you just practice public speaking with people that are actually encouraging you and want you to do better.

128
00:10:03.990 --> 00:10:05.250
They want to see you improve.

129
00:10:05.280 --> 00:10:08.340
So I'm trying to figure out a way to implement that same activity,

130
00:10:08.610 --> 00:10:12.680
That culture into our community. You see what I'm saying?

131
00:10:12.680 --> 00:10:17.480
Where every week, maybe a different member has to give a speech in front of the entire community

132
00:10:17.480 --> 00:10:21.320
And we can give them feedback and encouragement and ways to improve and that type of thing.

133
00:10:21.470 --> 00:10:25.190
I just think it would be valuable and really helpful because it's not just about language,

134
00:10:25.190 --> 00:10:28.340
It's about communication, it's about confidence and things like that.

135
00:10:28.340 --> 00:10:31.730
And that's a cool little activity that helped me gain confidence,

136
00:10:31.730 --> 00:10:35.060
And I think it'll do the same for you and the other members. You know?

137
00:10:35.060 --> 00:10:39.320
So this way, we'll have the perfect mixture of hosted group events,

138
00:10:39.350 --> 00:10:42.140
But also independent interactions between all the members.

139
00:10:42.140 --> 00:10:48.610
And what could be better than that? I mean, that's really a situation in which you have everything you need.

140
00:10:48.610 --> 00:10:52.120
Content, people, practice, mistakes, lessons... You know what I'm saying?

141
00:10:52.480 --> 00:10:58.360
Just the best of both worlds, of all worlds. If I can say it that way. You know?

142
00:10:58.360 --> 00:11:05.170
Now the fifth and final thing in terms of the membership or the community that I want to improve is the type of content I create.

143
00:11:05.920 --> 00:11:08.740
And I don't know why, but I really don't like the word content, bro.

144
00:11:09.220 --> 00:11:14.710
It's like such a vague and trendy word that's used to describe literally anything that's created by anyone.

145
00:11:14.710 --> 00:11:16.780
Like, Oh, I love your content. You know I'm saying?

146
00:11:18.040 --> 00:11:21.190
Anyway, anyway, that has nothing to do with my point. Let me stay on track.

147
00:11:21.910 --> 00:11:27.100
I've been thinking a lot lately about the best way to use my time and energy to improve Life in English.

148
00:11:27.730 --> 00:11:30.790
But the problem is that I'm juggling too many balls at the same time.

149
00:11:31.830 --> 00:11:35.370
From the research, the writing, the recording, the editing,

150
00:11:35.370 --> 00:11:41.820
The publishing and the sharing of the audio podcast, the video podcast, YouTube vocabulary

151
00:11:41.820 --> 00:11:47.100
And grammar lessons, short social media videos to promote the brand, working on future courses,

152
00:11:47.100 --> 00:11:52.050
Promoting the Life in English membership, trying to find ways to improve the membership and add more value.

153
00:11:53.490 --> 00:11:58.860
These are just a few of the things that I'm constantly working on, you know, to grow this business.

154
00:11:58.860 --> 00:12:00.480
But when you're trying to do everything at once,

155
00:12:00.480 --> 00:12:05.610
You're typically doing nothing or you end up doing nothing. You see what I'm saying?

156
00:12:05.610 --> 00:12:11.250
In other words, you're spending time and energy, you know, you're moving, but you're not making progress.

157
00:12:11.730 --> 00:12:19.030
So I had to take a step back and really decide which activities would bring the most impactful results to move the business forward.

158
00:12:19.030 --> 00:12:25.640
And the thing I hate doing the most by far is preparing those YouTube video lessons.

159
00:12:25.640 --> 00:12:30.640
Now, to be honest with you the only reason I started doing them is because I knew that YouTube is a search engine.

160
00:12:31.210 --> 00:12:33.790
People go on the site to search for specific videos.

161
00:12:35.240 --> 00:12:39.530
And most English learners on YouTube are looking for English lessons.

162
00:12:39.530 --> 00:12:42.500
Like, five ways to say thank you or five grammar mistakes you're making,

163
00:12:42.500 --> 00:12:45.080
Or three phrasal verbs for food, et cetera.

164
00:12:45.950 --> 00:12:51.680
And don't get me wrong, those types of lessons are extremely valuable, depending on your current level.

165
00:12:52.370 --> 00:12:53.210
And that's the point.

166
00:12:53.690 --> 00:12:56.720
Most people who follow me have already reached an intermediate level

167
00:12:56.720 --> 00:13:00.320
and don't really need to sit and watch vocabulary and grammar lessons.

168
00:13:00.800 --> 00:13:06.110
What you need is to start consuming things made for native speakers and having conversations with real people.

169
00:13:07.050 --> 00:13:09.930
So I've been doing the YouTube lessons as a form of content marketing,

170
00:13:09.930 --> 00:13:13.260
Simply as a way to attract more people to Life in English.

171
00:13:13.290 --> 00:13:16.920
Expose them to my podcast and thus the Life in English community.

172
00:13:17.930 --> 00:13:21.650
But the problem with that is, number one, I don't enjoy making them,

173
00:13:21.650 --> 00:13:24.920
So they drain so much vital time and energy from me.

174
00:13:24.920 --> 00:13:28.250
Number two, my core audience doesn't really need them,

175
00:13:28.250 --> 00:13:33.350
So I end up attracting two different audiences and I'm not giving 100% of my effort to either one.

176
00:13:33.560 --> 00:13:39.650
And now my audience is divided between two types of content and this type of content like grammar lessons

177
00:13:39.650 --> 00:13:45.440
And vocabulary and videos and stuff like this, although it's valuable is really not what my brand is about.

178
00:13:45.530 --> 00:13:50.300
When I say brand, I mean my culture, my lifestyle, my philosophy when it comes to teaching English,

179
00:13:50.540 --> 00:13:54.350
Language, culture, that type of stuff, communication, et cetera.

180
00:13:55.470 --> 00:14:00.420
My whole philosophy is really about living your life in that language, just talking to real people.

181
00:14:00.450 --> 00:14:04.560
Of course, you're going to look for lessons and for more formal stuff like that.

182
00:14:04.560 --> 00:14:08.400
But once you get to a certain level, it's just about living your life in that language,

183
00:14:08.400 --> 00:14:10.950
From the... the music you listen to, the movies you watch,

184
00:14:10.950 --> 00:14:13.620
Series, books you read, people you talk to.

185
00:14:14.310 --> 00:14:17.910
It's just about actually using the language. That's the whole philosophy. Right?

186
00:14:17.910 --> 00:14:24.420
So for me to then go and make boring grammar lessons just to attract people who aren't even at the level

187
00:14:24.420 --> 00:14:29.220
Of the stuff I really enjoy doing just doesn't really make sense when you stop and think about it.

188
00:14:29.220 --> 00:14:33.360
Because then what I really enjoy doing and what you guys really need starts to suffer

189
00:14:33.360 --> 00:14:36.240
Because I'm taking time and energy away from that and putting it into

190
00:14:36.240 --> 00:14:42.240
Something that I don't really want to do and isn't really helpful in the long run, I think. You know?

191
00:14:42.240 --> 00:14:45.660
And it just becomes one more thing to manage and to think about when the whole point of

192
00:14:45.660 --> 00:14:50.910
Starting my own business and working for myself was to be able to do things the way I want to do them,

193
00:14:51.420 --> 00:14:55.170
Not the way I have to do them. You feel me?

194
00:14:55.170 --> 00:14:57.210
So it just dawned on me that I don't have to, like,

195
00:14:57.480 --> 00:15:01.530
Keep doing anything that doesn't serve me, my business, or my customers.

196
00:15:02.160 --> 00:15:07.290
I can simply focus on what I like doing the most, what my community enjoys and needs the most,

197
00:15:07.290 --> 00:15:09.570
and what's truly going to make a difference at the end of the day.

198
00:15:09.570 --> 00:15:14.310
So from now on, I plan to focus solely on the podcast and, you know,

199
00:15:14.310 --> 00:15:17.190
Some short English tips for social media and stuff like that.

200
00:15:17.460 --> 00:15:20.160
And I can make the same video lessons that I did for YouTube,

201
00:15:20.160 --> 00:15:26.010
But just condense them into 60-second clips that are so much easier to prepare, record, edit and post.

202
00:15:26.220 --> 00:15:32.580
And I also reach a lot more people on TikTok and Instagram than I do on YouTube. At least at the moment.

203
00:15:32.580 --> 00:15:36.060
So it really makes more sense to dedicate more time and energy to those platforms,

204
00:15:36.060 --> 00:15:39.420
Since the goal is to reach as many people as quickly as possible.

205
00:15:40.510 --> 00:15:43.660
Now, YouTube just takes a lot more time and effort, and energy to grow,

206
00:15:43.660 --> 00:15:48.400
Especially when it's not clear exactly what type of videos people can expect from you every week.

207
00:15:49.660 --> 00:15:57.220
But anyway, I'm happy to say that I'm slowly gaining clarity on what I want to produce and exactly how I'm going to produce it.

208
00:15:57.220 --> 00:16:00.460
And I'm also gaining clarity on what you guys really need in terms of support.

209
00:16:00.790 --> 00:16:05.440
So slowly but surely, things are improving around here. You know?

210
00:16:06.100 --> 00:16:09.550
And that's ironically how it works with any skill or project you're developing.

211
00:16:10.120 --> 00:16:15.370
You just get started. You bump your head. You figured things out. You have wins and losses.

212
00:16:15.370 --> 00:16:22.090
You laugh, you cry. You want to quit. But you stick with it. You stick with it. You know what I'm saying?

213
00:16:22.090 --> 00:16:25.900
You start to get the hang of things and you gain the confidence or the experience,

214
00:16:25.900 --> 00:16:29.230
Which leads to confidence that you need to move forward

215
00:16:29.230 --> 00:16:36.450
And really do something great or become someone great in the process. You know?

216
00:16:36.450 --> 00:16:38.970
So in terms of the membership and what I'm producing,

217
00:16:38.970 --> 00:16:44.640
Those are things that I really think can use an improvement and those are the things that are getting the majority of my attention right now.

218
00:16:44.670 --> 00:16:49.560
You know what I'm saying? Not on the business side, which is not necessarily different from the membership part,

219
00:16:49.560 --> 00:16:55.710
But on the business side I think three things that can be improved are the pricing strategy, you know?

220
00:16:55.710 --> 00:16:59.460
Because I've been experimenting a little bit with the price of the membership

221
00:16:59.460 --> 00:17:07.110
Because it's kind of hard to find a sweet spot or a perfect number in between what I need to run the business successfully

222
00:17:07.110 --> 00:17:11.820
and how much you can actually pay every month. You know?

223
00:17:11.820 --> 00:17:14.430
There's not really any secret formula to figure out what that number is.

224
00:17:14.430 --> 00:17:19.290
You kind of have to experiment and figure out how much money do I need to keep the business going

225
00:17:19.290 --> 00:17:21.750
and also make money so I can pay my own bills. Right?

226
00:17:22.200 --> 00:17:28.510
But also at a, at a price that won't break the bank for your customers.

227
00:17:28.540 --> 00:17:32.980
And when I say break the bank, I just... I really just mean a price that's too much for your customer.

228
00:17:33.160 --> 00:17:37.570
So I'm trying to figure out what that number is and the strategy behind it.

229
00:17:37.570 --> 00:17:39.970
Like, what's the reasoning for it and why does it make sense?

230
00:17:40.120 --> 00:17:45.040
And at the moment recording this episode, you have two choices, right?

231
00:17:45.040 --> 00:17:50.560
You can do the 5 dollar membership with less benefits or the 7 dollar membership with complete benefits.

232
00:17:50.560 --> 00:17:55.600
Before it was like 7, 12 and 36 dollars, and you had a bunch of different choices.

233
00:17:55.600 --> 00:18:02.620
And there's different strategies that I won't talk about now behind those pricing decisions or those, those yeah, those prices.

234
00:18:02.620 --> 00:18:03.820
There's different strategies behind those.

235
00:18:03.820 --> 00:18:09.130
But now I think it makes much more sense to offer just one flat rate, one simple price.

236
00:18:09.310 --> 00:18:11.980
But if you want to pay every month, it's this price.

237
00:18:11.980 --> 00:18:14.800
If you want to pay every three months, it's this price with a little discount.

238
00:18:14.800 --> 00:18:17.830
If you want to pay once a year, you get an even greater discount.

239
00:18:17.830 --> 00:18:20.380
So the price is really the same, but making a longer commitment,

240
00:18:20.380 --> 00:18:24.930
You obviously save money with a better price. You get the discount that way.

241
00:18:24.940 --> 00:18:30.460
And I just think that keeps pricing very simple, very direct and very transparent. You know?

242
00:18:30.460 --> 00:18:33.070
There's no strategies or manipulation or psychology hacks.

243
00:18:33.070 --> 00:18:37.870
It's just, this is the price and it's this price because of the value that we provide

244
00:18:37.870 --> 00:18:41.980
And also what we need to keep the business going because obviously without revenue, there's no business.

245
00:18:42.100 --> 00:18:45.430
So I'm going to work on that a little bit more.

246
00:18:45.430 --> 00:18:48.760
And the only reason I'm telling you this stuff...

247
00:18:48.760 --> 00:18:50.650
Actually in a second, I'll tell you why I'm telling you these things.

248
00:18:50.650 --> 00:18:58.960
But as far as pricing goes, I think that's going to be the strategy going forward until I find the perfect number and the perfect,

249
00:18:58.960 --> 00:19:06.410
You know, business model to sustain consistent revenue at a price as mutually beneficial

250
00:19:06.410 --> 00:19:13.530
Or mutually acceptable by everyone involved. You know? So that's one thing.

251
00:19:13.530 --> 00:19:16.350
I feel like there was more I wanted to say there, which is why I'm kind of rambling.

252
00:19:16.350 --> 00:19:21.540
But anyway, I'm going to move on to the second thing, which is how we attract and keep members in the community.

253
00:19:21.780 --> 00:19:26.910
Because right now, so far since I launched, the cool thing is that I've done almost zero marketing.

254
00:19:26.910 --> 00:19:32.670
I haven't paid or really done many videos or talked about it too much in terms of marketing the membership.

255
00:19:32.670 --> 00:19:35.280
And we're still getting like one new member every week for the past,

256
00:19:35.280 --> 00:19:41.150
I don't know, three months, I think. Maybe four, I can't remember what month we launched.

257
00:19:41.150 --> 00:19:44.880
But like three or four months ago. And that's cool considering that we're not marketing at all.

258
00:19:45.480 --> 00:19:50.220
But I want to go from one member a week to, you know,

259
00:19:50.220 --> 00:19:53.510
10 members a week and then 10 members a day. You see what I'm saying?

260
00:19:53.520 --> 00:19:56.910
I mean, like, really grow this thing into what I envisioned it to be.

261
00:19:57.630 --> 00:20:00.660
And not only how to attract more people, but how to keep them.

262
00:20:00.660 --> 00:20:05.040
And that goes back to the first half of this episode, which was me talking about how to provide more value,

263
00:20:05.070 --> 00:20:09.720
How to make the community more enjoyable and get more people engaged

264
00:20:09.720 --> 00:20:13.740
And really get you guys using the language so that you see the benefit,

265
00:20:13.740 --> 00:20:18.120
you feel the results in your process. You know? So not just getting new members,

266
00:20:18.120 --> 00:20:27.360
But keeping them because it's so much easier to focus on current members than it is to get new ones. You see what I'm saying?

267
00:20:27.360 --> 00:20:32.460
Because we can be a very profitable business and very high quality community, even if it's not 50000 people.

268
00:20:32.460 --> 00:20:36.150
It could be 1000. It could really be 500. You know?

269
00:20:36.150 --> 00:20:38.730
Because the community is only as good as its members.

270
00:20:38.820 --> 00:20:47.070
And I know it's my responsibility to start to train the members to start - really would change - to change their behavior.

271
00:20:47.220 --> 00:20:49.740
You see what I'm saying? That's really what you're doing when you're teaching culture.

272
00:20:49.770 --> 00:20:52.550
You're teaching new ways of behaving or interacting with people.

273
00:20:52.560 --> 00:20:58.970
And essentially, the culture I'm trying to create is one in which people are not afraid to step out of their comfort zones,

274
00:20:58.980 --> 00:21:04.070
Approach new people and make conversation. You know? Forge relationships.

275
00:21:04.070 --> 00:21:10.340
And the techniques that you can learn, that you can study, learn and apply to actually get that done.

276
00:21:10.340 --> 00:21:12.770
Because it's not enough to just say, "Hey, how are you doing?"

277
00:21:12.860 --> 00:21:14.870
Or, "Hey, I want to speak English with you". Right?

278
00:21:14.870 --> 00:21:18.800
There's so much more than that when it comes to making a connection with a stranger

279
00:21:19.070 --> 00:21:25.280
And then sustaining a conversation and then having interactions that make you both want to talk to each other again. You know?

280
00:21:25.280 --> 00:21:26.360
So I'm getting off topic here.

281
00:21:26.360 --> 00:21:30.200
But I just think that's a really, really important part of sustaining a business like this one.

282
00:21:30.230 --> 00:21:37.190
It's all about the community, and we have to figure out how to attract quality members and keep them. Right?

283
00:21:37.190 --> 00:21:38.960
And the last thing in terms of business, I think,

284
00:21:38.990 --> 00:21:47.640
Is finding other ways to generate revenue because what that does is allow me to have more money to not only enjoy my life,

285
00:21:47.640 --> 00:21:52.450
But invest into the business so that you can keep the price of the membership as low as possible.

286
00:21:52.450 --> 00:21:55.080
Because the monthly expense is very different from a one time expense.

287
00:21:56.160 --> 00:22:04.620
It's much easier to spend $200 one time on one product or one course than it is to spend $200 every month for a membership. Right?

288
00:22:05.070 --> 00:22:10.740
Like, if Netflix cost, you know, 8 dollars every time you logged in, you would never use it.

289
00:22:10.740 --> 00:22:12.600
But it's just 8 bucks a month or 10 bucks a month.

290
00:22:13.140 --> 00:22:19.900
The price has to be, you know, realistic in terms of how much money I'd pay every month for this ongoing service.

291
00:22:19.900 --> 00:22:23.730
But a product, you can price it much differently. So I think things like merchandise,

292
00:22:23.740 --> 00:22:27.910
I really want to get into selling T-shirts and things like that.

293
00:22:27.910 --> 00:22:32.470
Coffee mugs, stickers, things that you only have to buy one time

294
00:22:32.470 --> 00:22:37.030
And they're just cool little things that you can buy if you want to support me or represent the brand,

295
00:22:37.030 --> 00:22:39.880
Represent Life in English and the culture and the community.

296
00:22:39.880 --> 00:22:43.630
And that way it's not all about trying to make money off with the membership,

297
00:22:43.630 --> 00:22:49.090
But we can generate money in other ways. Because at the end of the day, it is a business bro. You know?

298
00:22:49.720 --> 00:22:54.070
And I think that brings me to my last point, because I see I'm rambling here.

299
00:22:54.370 --> 00:22:56.440
So my final thoughts.

300
00:22:57.840 --> 00:23:02.060
Just understand that I'm the type of person who learns as he goes. See what I'm saying?

301
00:23:02.070 --> 00:23:08.400
I started this business with no real idea or plan or vision of how I'd make it truly successful,

302
00:23:08.400 --> 00:23:10.290
so I've just been figuring things out along the way.

303
00:23:10.860 --> 00:23:13.140
So I really want to thank you from the bottom of my heart, man,

304
00:23:13.140 --> 00:23:17.370
For even giving me and my project a chance. You know?

305
00:23:17.370 --> 00:23:19.500
Your support truly means the world to me,

306
00:23:19.500 --> 00:23:24.060
Because it's with the support of people just like you that I'll be able to build this business into

307
00:23:24.060 --> 00:23:27.030
Something that is truly beneficial for everyone involved.

308
00:23:27.750 --> 00:23:31.290
Because it's really not every day that someone decides to support your work

309
00:23:31.290 --> 00:23:35.820
By giving a portion of their hard-earned money to you every month.

310
00:23:36.330 --> 00:23:38.970
But that's what you've done for me, and I don't take that lightly.

311
00:23:39.510 --> 00:23:44.540
So I'm working hard to make Life in English and this community the best place to be if you want to learn English,

312
00:23:44.550 --> 00:23:48.480
Make some cool friends and grow as a person. You know what I'm saying?

313
00:23:49.620 --> 00:23:51.760
So that's your update for this month, my friend.

314
00:23:51.780 --> 00:23:55.590
Now you know where we are with Life in English and where we're headed.

315
00:23:55.590 --> 00:23:59.580
And I'm going to start doing these updates more often because I want you to be involved in what's happening here.

316
00:23:59.610 --> 00:24:04.200
I think being transparent with you about how things work is the best way for you to understand

317
00:24:04.200 --> 00:24:08.400
Exactly what you're investing in and why it's so important. You know what I'm saying?

318
00:24:08.400 --> 00:24:11.700
So that's kind of what I was trying to explain earlier is the reason I'm telling you like,

319
00:24:11.730 --> 00:24:15.420
How I think we can improve in terms of business or how the business works,

320
00:24:15.570 --> 00:24:21.720
The strategy or the thinking behind the pricing model and the thing the projects and events I want to start doing.

321
00:24:21.720 --> 00:24:26.570
For you to really understand all these details, I think allows you to understand what you're paying for.

322
00:24:26.570 --> 00:24:31.470
And when you understand what you're paying for and you understand that it's not just about money.

323
00:24:31.470 --> 00:24:34.410
But like... I should say that differently.

324
00:24:34.410 --> 00:24:38.250
It is about money, but when you understand where the money's going and why it's important,

325
00:24:38.250 --> 00:24:42.500
I think you can sleep a little bit easier knowing that you're,

326
00:24:42.530 --> 00:24:45.390
That you're paying money for this thing. You know?

327
00:24:45.390 --> 00:24:47.900
When you don't really understand it, there's a lot of question marks

328
00:24:48.110 --> 00:24:50.810
And you have all these questions or doubts about why things are happening

329
00:24:50.810 --> 00:24:54.470
Or why things cost what they do or why this person says these things,

330
00:24:54.710 --> 00:24:57.350
You know, then you just are left to make your own interpretations.

331
00:24:57.350 --> 00:25:00.580
But I think when businesses are transparent, it's much more easy or,

332
00:25:00.590 --> 00:25:03.950
Excuse me, much easier to get invested. You know what I'm saying?

333
00:25:04.900 --> 00:25:09.340
So, yeah. That's really it, man.

334
00:25:09.340 --> 00:25:10.540
I could say a whole lot more about that,

335
00:25:10.540 --> 00:25:14.230
But I'm trying my hardest to work on my rambling and shit.

336
00:25:14.830 --> 00:25:16.540
I just wanted to give you a quick update, man.

337
00:25:16.540 --> 00:25:18.850
So I think that's it for now, my friend.

338
00:25:18.850 --> 00:25:22.030
Hit me up on a Discord channel if you want to talk about any of these subjects,

339
00:25:22.030 --> 00:25:27.220
Business, life, English, community, you know, all that type of stuff.

340
00:25:27.220 --> 00:25:29.760
These are some of my favorite subjects so I could talk for days.

341
00:25:29.770 --> 00:25:33.400
But like I said, my goal is to really get you guys more involved in this community

342
00:25:33.400 --> 00:25:37.090
Because that's what I'm trying to build at the end of the day. You know?

343
00:25:37.090 --> 00:25:40.660
So hit me up on Discord, man, if you want to talk about these things

344
00:25:40.730 --> 00:25:44.320
Or talk about anything, really. You know?

345
00:25:44.320 --> 00:25:47.680
But that's it for Coffee with Kaizen number 31 is in the books.

346
00:25:48.340 --> 00:25:50.500
So, my friend, I will talk to you later.

347
00:25:51.480 --> 00:25:51.960
Peace!

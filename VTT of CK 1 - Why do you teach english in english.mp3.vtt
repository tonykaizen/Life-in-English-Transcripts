1
00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:06.390
That's good stuff. Good morning, good afternoon, good
evening, depending on where you might be in the world. This

2
00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:12.430
is the first, the very first episode of Coffee with Kaizen,
alright?

3
00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:19.090
Now, you might be asking yourself, what is Coffee with
Kaizen? Is it a new podcast? A new video series? The answer

4
00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:24.360
is yes and no, alright? Because if you've been following me
for any amount of time, you probably know about the Life in

5
00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:30.090
English podcast, which I've been doing for a couple years
now. That's not gonna change, but I want to do an

6
00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:36.870
experiment. So for the next month, alright, the next month
from Monday to Friday, every morning, I'm gonna sit here,

7
00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:43.490
enjoy my morning cup of coffee like I always do and just
chat with you for a little bit, you know? I might share, uh,

8
00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:49.700
an interesting story, a quick English tip, answer questions
that you guys ask me all the time on social media and stuff

9
00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:57.540
like that. The point is, we're just gonna enjoy our morning
cup of coffee together every day, Monday to Friday for the

10
00:00:57.540 --> 00:00:58.950
next month.

11
00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:05.860
We'll see how it goes, alright? So you can kind of think of
coffee with Kaizen as a daily podcast where Life in English

12
00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:15.850
is more like a weekly podcast, right? And, uh, Life in
English is kinda like the parent and Coffee

13
00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:20.090
with Kaizen would be like the child, I don't know. But you
have the tree, which is Life in English, and then you have

14
00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:26.850
the branches. And one of those branches would be Coffee with
Kaizen. Hopefully that makes sense. It's not really

15
00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:33.540
important. Just understand that you're gonna be seeing this
face every day for the next month, alright? We're gonna get

16
00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.340
real close. Real close.

17
00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:41.870
But anyway, for the first episode of Coffee with Kaizen, I
got some notes here actually, because I didn't want to

18
00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:49.440
forget anything I wanted to say. So yeah, like I said, what
you should expect, uh, in every episode, it's just something

19
00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:54.270
different. I'm just gonna... It's very similar to the Life
in English podcast, just a much shorter version and it's

20
00:01:54.270 --> 00:02:00.840
daily, you know what I mean? Because sometimes I won't go
super crazy deep into a subject like I would on the Life of

21
00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:06.470
English podcast, but if there's just a quick English tip or
a question that I can answer for somebody or just say,

22
00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:11.540
"What's up?" first thing in the morning, I think that would
be valuable to you because it's always a different subject

23
00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:17.950
and I'll always be teaching you something about life or
English. So just your little daily dose of English with

24
00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:19.290
Kaizen, right?

25
00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:26.800
Alright. So the question of the day, now that we got the
intro...the introductions and the formalities and all that

26
00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:35.410
shit out the way, what's the question of the day? I get
asked all the time now, why do you only teach English in

27
00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:41.770
English, especially when you can speak other languages? How
are you going to teach me to speak English if I'm learning

28
00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:48.870
English and I can't really understand all of it, how can you
teach me only speaking English? Why do you do that? And I

29
00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:55.040
think it's um...it's a (an) understandable question, but the
answer is actually very simple I just don't think people

30
00:02:55.040 --> 00:03:01.830
like it very much. The reason I teach English only in
English is because I learned very early in my language

31
00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:07.630
learning journey that the best way to learn a language is by
immersing yourself in that language. And a lot of people

32
00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:16.460
will say, "You got to move to that foreign country to learn
that language." I say, "That's bullshit." But that's just my

33
00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:24.340
opinion. I think that you can find many different ways to
live your life in a particular language at home every day,

34
00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:30.160
you know what I'm saying? And when you stop and think about
it, this is the philosophy, we don't have to overthink these

35
00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:37.310
things. English or language is not like math, science,
history, social studies, things like that. I've said this a

36
00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:41.720
hundred times on the Life in English podcast. I'm gonna say
it a hundred more times until people really start to

37
00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:48.280
understand, you know? There's a more effective way to do
this shit. You've already done it. You've already done it.

38
00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:56.010
How do I learn a foreign language? The question is
understandable. I had the same question years ago. But the

39
00:03:56.040 --> 00:04:03.520
answer is very simple. Do exactly what you did when you
learned your first language. What did you do? You were a

40
00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:08.730
baby, the people around you were making certain noises. They
were talking to you. You didn't understand what the fuck was

41
00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:14.300
going on. But slowly --I don't know how this works I'm not a
linguist-- but slowly something in the brain starts

42
00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:20.230
happening to where these words, these sounds that everyone
around you is making start to make sense, right? Bottle.

43
00:04:20.990 --> 00:04:22.050
Cup. Coffee.

44
00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:28.200
Mom. Dad. These words start to have meaning for some reason.
I don't know how it works, but that's what happens. And

45
00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:34.710
slowly over time, you start trying to talk back. You're just
making noises, you know? And over time, you can see in a

46
00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:41.290
baby there's intent there. They're not saying words per se.
They're making noises. And you can see there's an intent to

47
00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:42.970
communicate, right?

48
00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:48.290
And slowly over time, they start learning how to pronounce
words then they have their first words. And that this whole

49
00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:55.040
time, all they hear around them is that language. English,
for example. That's all I hear all day, every day around me

50
00:04:55.040 --> 00:05:02.530
on the TV, the radio, mom, dad, sister, brother, everybody
speaking English. All the time. So I...Then I start trying

51
00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:09.550
to imitate the people around me and start speaking English
all the time. And slowly but surely I get better at putting

52
00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:15.570
sentences together, learning new words. I learned context
and things like that. Then I learned to read and write.

53
00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:23.750
You've already done it. You already done it. You didn't
learn your native language in a foreign language. You

54
00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:31.300
learned it in the native language. So I don't see any
logical reason to apply any other strategy, methodology or

55
00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:38.100
way of thinking when it comes to learning another one. Just
do the same thing. The difference is - now you're most

56
00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:43.880
likely an adult. You might be a teenager if you're watching
this, you might be anywhere from sixteen to sixty, I don't

57
00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:52.520
know. But the point is - you're older now, so you have the
benefit of experience, you understand?

58
00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:59.370
Hopefully you understand context. You can use the context of
a situation to infer what's happening or what's being said.

59
00:05:59.370 --> 00:06:06.630
To guess, to imagine what's being said. What's the facial
expression? What's the tone of voice? What would I say in

60
00:06:06.630 --> 00:06:12.350
that situation? Could I understand a few words then maybe
guess the meaning of the entire sentence? Stuff like that.

61
00:06:12.350 --> 00:06:20.480
You can do that now as an adult. Or as a child, I don't
think...I don't think a child thinks the same way when

62
00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:25.940
they're hearing a foreign language or just a new language,
you know? They're just kind of soaking it up. And I guess

63
00:06:25.940 --> 00:06:33.100
that's the point is you have to be in a point, you got to be
at a place where you can kind of be comfortable feeling like

64
00:06:33.100 --> 00:06:41.290
a kid. Because you are, like, you have to go back to zero or
age five or age seven where you can communicate a little

65
00:06:41.290 --> 00:06:47.660
bit, but a lot of stuff you don't understand. You can
express yourself like you want to or like you would like to,

66
00:06:48.350 --> 00:06:55.130
right? And just every single day listen to that language and
speak that language. That's how you learned your first

67
00:06:55.130 --> 00:07:00.180
language. You didn't take any courses to learn your first
language, you just learned it. There are people that cannot

68
00:07:00.180 --> 00:07:03.770
read, but they can speak a language.

69
00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:11.040
What does that tell me? It means that you don't need
to...I'm not saying English schools are bad. I'm not saying

70
00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:17.850
school is bad, education is bad. Not even close to my point.
I'm just saying that if somebody who didn't even finish

71
00:07:18.180 --> 00:07:26.120
fourth grade, somebody who dropped out of school before they
turned ten can still speak a language, what does that say

72
00:07:26.120 --> 00:07:34.040
about you and me? It means that anybody can learn a
language, though it's not dependent on how smart you are or

73
00:07:34.040 --> 00:07:40.130
how educated you are. You need to know how to learn, and I'm
here to help you learn that. But other than that, dude,

74
00:07:40.210 --> 00:07:46.060
like, just don't overcomplicate it. So getting back to the
question itself --because I don't feel like I've answered

75
00:07:46.060 --> 00:07:51.820
it-- the reason that I teach English in English is because I
feel it's the most effective way. Besides that, I don't make

76
00:07:52.310 --> 00:07:59.360
lessons or content or material for beginners. That's just
not my specialty. That's not what I'm really interested in.

77
00:07:59.360 --> 00:08:05.260
That's not what I'm good at, you know? This is more for like
the pre-intermediate, intermediate, advanced people who I've

78
00:08:05.260 --> 00:08:11.210
already gained some type of understanding and working
knowledge of the basics of the English language. So if

79
00:08:11.210 --> 00:08:16.830
you're having a hard time understanding me right now, I'm
not saying that this isn't for you, I'm just saying that I'm

80
00:08:16.830 --> 00:08:23.620
not speaking directly to somebody who has just started
learning English. I'm happy to help in any way I can, and I

81
00:08:23.620 --> 00:08:30.530
hope that you find what I do helpful as well but that's just
it. It's totally valuable to have somebody who speaks your

82
00:08:30.530 --> 00:08:35.620
native language, teaching you, trying to learn a foreign
language in the beginning because you need to translate, you

83
00:08:35.650 --> 00:08:42.190
need to understand complex ways of thinking or just
different ways of thinking that are abstract to you because

84
00:08:42.190 --> 00:08:49.050
we think different ways in different languages, right?
Totally valuable, probably even necessary for all of us. But

85
00:08:49.050 --> 00:08:55.180
there comes a point when you gotta move away from that and
understand the more productive way. The only way you're

86
00:08:55.180 --> 00:09:01.140
gonna reach the next level truly is to leave your native
language behind, put it in your pocket, leave it at home,

87
00:09:01.800 --> 00:09:10.420
don't bring it with you to class and rebuild your brain or
build a new brain in a new language, a new way of seeing the

88
00:09:10.420 --> 00:09:16.610
world, a new way of describing reality, a new way of
communicating and expressing yourself. You can't be thinking

89
00:09:16.610 --> 00:09:22.990
about your native language when you're trying to learn a new
one. You're just slowing yourself down. So I just think it's

90
00:09:22.990 --> 00:09:27.790
the best way, man. It's the best way for those who really
want to challenge themselves, who really want to learn, who

91
00:09:27.790 --> 00:09:33.780
really want to improve their comprehension, their vocabulary
to understanding. It's... I'm not saying it's the only way.

92
00:09:33.850 --> 00:09:39.160
I just think it's the best way. That's the whole concept
behind Life in English is if you want to learn a foreign

93
00:09:39.160 --> 00:09:45.420
language, you just have to live your life in that language.
That's it. When I was learning Spanish, I would wake up

94
00:09:45.450 --> 00:09:50.300
every day and live my life in Spanish. When I was learning
Portuguese, I'd wake up every day and live my life in

95
00:09:50.300 --> 00:09:59.130
Portuguese. And I still do till today. Speak English, in
Spanish and Portuguese basically every day, even if I'm

96
00:09:59.130 --> 00:10:03.820
talking to myself. That's the whole concept, you know?

97
00:10:03.910 --> 00:10:11.140
There's no secrets. There's no tips. Do not waste $300 or
$500 or $1,000 on some bullshit course somebody saying they

98
00:10:11.140 --> 00:10:17.440
got the secret to fluency because it doesn't exist. You
already got the secret. Just ask yourself, what did I do to

99
00:10:17.440 --> 00:10:26.100
learn my first language? And do that. Hopefully that makes
sense.

100
00:10:26.500 --> 00:10:32.640
I haven't taken a sip of coffee since this transmission
started, but that's it for now. That's episode one in the

101
00:10:32.780 --> 00:10:40.260
books. Hopefully you enjoyed and I'll see you tomorrow. No,
actually, not tomorrow, because today is Thursday, August

102
00:10:40.260 --> 00:10:41.750
12th, 2021.

103
00:10:42.110 --> 00:10:49.130
It's crazy that we're in August already, man. It feels like
just a month ago it was 2021. Everybody was like, "Whoo!

104
00:10:49.130 --> 00:10:55.860
2020 is over." You know what I'm saying? We're in August,
the middle of August. But anyway, I record this today, I'm

105
00:10:55.860 --> 00:11:01.370
gonna edit it later this evening when I get some time. I'll
release it Friday morning. So every episode that you see

106
00:11:01.370 --> 00:11:07.430
will be from the previous day. So I record this on Thursday,
release the next episode on Friday. So Imma record one

107
00:11:07.430 --> 00:11:14.510
tomorrow morning and release it on Monday, you get what I'm
saying? So just a reminder, Monday to Friday, most likely at

108
00:11:14.510 --> 00:11:22.630
8 a.m. - Coffee with Kaizen. It's a part of the Life in
English podcast, it's kind of like, um, a subseries of Life

109
00:11:22.630 --> 00:11:28.030
in English podcast. So these episodes, or at least the
next... all the episodes from the next month will be on the

110
00:11:28.030 --> 00:11:32.960
same podcast feed as Life in English. They'll be on
lifeinenglish.net. You can find them there, Spotify,

111
00:11:32.960 --> 00:11:40.370
anywhere that you watch or listen to the podcast, it'll be
there. If you can't find it, shoot me a message on social or

112
00:11:40.370 --> 00:11:43.310
an email maybe @englishwithkaizen.

113
00:11:44.200 --> 00:11:50.310
And, um, if you can't find, I'll try to help you find it
somewhere, alright? But that's it, man. Episode one in the

114
00:11:50.310 --> 00:11:55.440
books. Hopefully you enjoyed and I'll see you...I'll see you
when I see you. Peace!

00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:01.650
Ki:
Tell me what I can't say here?

2
00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:03.260
Tony Kaizen:
There's nothing you can't say, I promise.

3
00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:04.440
Zac (cameraman):
There ain't nothing off limits, brother.

4
00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:05.380
Ki:
Okay, fuck it.

5
00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:06.870
Tony Kaizen:
100% uncensored.

6
00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:09.410
This is America, after all. You know what I'm saying?

7
00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:16.880
Ki:
Okay, what you got?

8
00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:19.130
Tony Kaizen:
Alright, we're good? Let's do it, man. Alright so, what's
your name?

9
00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:19.570
Ki:
Ki.

10
00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:24.520
Tony Kaizen:
Ki. Alright, so the first question we got for you is, when
you hear the term the American Dream, what comes to mind?

11
00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:25.240
What does that mean to you?

12
00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:31.960
Ki:
It's kind of antiquated. It depends on the person. The dream
is a dream. I mean it's just a dream. It's not necessarily a

13
00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:34.550
reality. It's a dream, to most.

14
00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:37.570
Tony Kaizen:
To most. Who are you referring to when you say, "to most
people"?

15
00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:44.150
Ki:
Hmm just regular people. Not...the dream is only to people
that can attain it. Like people with money, people with

16
00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:49.730
means, those are the only people that can really, truly
attain that American dream. Most of the people are gonna be

17
00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:53.400
normal. So is that really a dream or is that just living?

18
00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:58.750
Tony Kaizen:
Now, when you think of the dream, are you thinking about,
like, possessions, about status, money? What does the dream

19
00:00:58.750 --> 00:00:59.530
actually mean?

20
00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:04.730
Ki:
The dream is being able to control your life and control how
you live it. Most of the time you're being controlled by

21
00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:06.830
work or something else. Yeah.

22
00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:12.450
Tony Kaizen:
And do you think that most people, you kind of said this
earlier, but do you think most people don't even have a

23
00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.300
chance to achieve that dream?

24
00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:21.250
Ki:
I think if they work hard, but it takes work. People aren't
willing to put the work in to attain some of the things that

25
00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:28.670
they want. So most of the time, people don't get it because
they don't work for it, or they don't try. This shit ain't

26
00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.940
easy.

27
00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:32.540
Tony Kaizen:
Yeah. Do you think it's just hardwork that you need? Or
maybe something else?

28
00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:38.770
Ki:
Shit, you need some luck. Luck happens for everybody. Yeah.
You need some fortune. Luck and fortune. Fortune not in

29
00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:40.390
money, but fortune in opportunity.

30
00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:46.190
Tony Kaizen:
Right, right, right. Yeah. Now, we do know this as, like the
land of opportunity as well. Do you think that this country

31
00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:48.250
in particular has more opportunities than others?

32
00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:54.780
Ki:
Yeah. Absolutely. Absolutely. First world problems. Yeah.
First world situation. So other parts of the world, you

33
00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:59.340
don't have those opportunities. There is no middle class in
most of the world. We have a middle class.

34
00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:03.610
Tony Kaizen:
So sticking with the topic of the US, like, what are some
things that you love about this country?

35
00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:06.510
Ki:
This. Us.

36
00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:12.170
I mean, I see a white dude. I see...I don't know what the
fuck he is, but he's cool. And you're a black dude,

37
00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:14.880
obviously. It's like a whole bunch of shit, and I like it.

38
00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:15.840
Tony Kaizen:
Yeah. Melting pot, right?

39
00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:20.730
Ki:
Yeah, it's a melting pot. So you guys all can...you may not
always agree, but we...we're right here in this

40
00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:22.730
conversation. So yeah, yeah.

41
00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:27.940
Tony Kaizen:
Okay, now, what are some things that you hate or wish were
different or could be better about the US?

42
00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:34.430
Ki:
Hmmm...Every...Oh shiii...That's a good question. That's a
very, very good question. That's a very hard question to

43
00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:44.490
think about. Umm I think what I don't like about this
country is, umm...the, the lies that the country...the

44
00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:53.740
lies that we live in. Social media is a big lie. All the
things that we exist in are mainly about image and how you

45
00:02:53.740 --> 00:03:00.170
look, not how you are, who you are. So the country is about
appearance and not who you are.

46
00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:01.230
Tony Kaizen:
Keeping up with the Joneses.

47
00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:06.590
Ki:
Yeah. Keeping up with the Joneses. Keeping up with
appearances. Looking fly and not being fly. Being

48
00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:07.510
responsible. You know?

49
00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:13.180
Tony Kaizen:
Yeah, that's a good one. Okay, so this next question is not
related to the US, a little more personal. If all the jobs

50
00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:18.340
and professions in the world paid the exact same and you
were prepared to do them, let's say starting tomorrow, what

51
00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:18.840
job would you do?

52
00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:23.220
Ki:
If all the jobs paid the same? Umm, therapist?

53
00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:24.340
Tony Kaizen:
Really? Why?

54
00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:27.500
Ki:
Hmm because I think I like the psychology of people and
helping people.

55
00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:31.940
Tony Kaizen:
Yeah. I mean, you say therapist. You mean like sitting in
the office and talking one on one?

56
00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:34.410
Ki:
Yeah. Clinical...clinical therapist or something like that.

57
00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:35.440
Tony Kaizen:
Okay, yeah. What's your background?

58
00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:36.350
Ki:
Art.

59
00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:38.150
Tony Kaizen:
What kind of art?

60
00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:38.690
What do you mean?

61
00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:40.310
Ki:
Art director. So yeah.

62
00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:43.760
Tony Kaizen:
Okay. Psychology, in a way. When you think about it.

63
00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:46.730
Ki:
Yeah. Yeah, I'm solving a...I'm solving a creative problem.
Yeah.

64
00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:48.270
Tony Kaizen:
Nice. Now, how old are you?

65
00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:49.290
Ki:
45.

66
00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:55.630
Tony Kaizen:
45. So let's say you could go back to like 21 or maybe 18
years old and give your younger self some advice, what would

67
00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:55.970
you tell him?

68
00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:57.180
Ki:
I'll slap the shit out of myself.

69
00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:59.270
Tony Kaizen:
Why would you slap him?

70
00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:02.370
Ki:
Oh, cos he fucking stupid. I was a fucking idiot.

71
00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:04.960
Tony Kaizen:
Yeah. What's that? What stupid stuff are you doing back
then?

72
00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:12.320
Ki:
Can't say it on this one. Nah uh! Some things don't have a
statute of limitations.

73
00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:17.680
Tony Kaizen:
'Nuff said, 'nuff said. We're going to skip right over that
one. Alright, alright. So the last one is, what are some

74
00:04:17.710 --> 00:04:22.830
things that maybe when people first meet you or get a first
impression of you, that they assume but are certainly not

75
00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:22.940
true?

76
00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:25.150
Ki's wife:
He's a dick!

77
00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:32.090
Ki:
That is true. They assume that I'm an asshole. They assume
that I'm an asshole. That's the first impression that they

78
00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:40.170
get. Probably right. But after you get to know me, probably
not an asshole, fully. But if I go asshole, I go full

79
00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:41.200
asshole. I won't go half ass.

80
00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:42.310
Tony Kaizen:
0 to 100.

81
00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:45.650
Ki:
Yeah I go, I'm always...I'm fully invested in being an
asshole.

82
00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:48.280
Tony Kaizen:
Okay. Now, why do you think people assume that about you,
though?

83
00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:53.520
Ki:
Cos I'm extremely direct and I don't have...I don't suffer
fools gladly. I'm extraordinarily direct.

84
00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:55.930
Tony Kaizen:
What do you mean by that, "You don't suffer fools gladly"?
What does that mean?

85
00:04:55.930 --> 00:05:04.770
Ki:
I don't like stupid shit. I don't like stupid people. I
mean, it's stupid in regards of...you can be oblivious, but

86
00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:11.790
willful...willful idiots bother me. Umm so yeah, willful
idiots bother me. Very simple.

87
00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:18.360
Tony Kaizen:
Do you think in general, going back to the American culture
thing, that we're not very direct people in general and

88
00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:19.160
that's why people assume...

89
00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:27.950
Ki:
You'll cancel. I would get canceled if I was on TV. I'm not
politically correct at all. I'm 40. I'm a...I'm a 45 year

90
00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:34.260
old black man. I've experienced so much dumb shit that you
would not expect so political correctness doesn't really

91
00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:40.080
work for me very well because I think people need a
harsh...a direct message to change. Because if you tell them

92
00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:45.090
nice, they don't listen anyway, they complain about it
so...why be nice? Be honest.

93
00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:50.570
Tony Kaizen:
Now you're much older than me, so you probably have a better
memory of, let's say, 30 or 40 years ago. Do you think that

94
00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:56.240
even back then the whole political correctness thing was a
big part of our culture and society? Or that's recent?

95
00:05:56.240 --> 00:06:02.280
Ki:
Not at all. It's recent. It's recent. It's recent because
you sit...we would sit in these echo chambers now. Social

96
00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:08.880
media is a lot of echo chambers where everybody with a like
mind can agree. Everybody with a like mind can totally

97
00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:09.100
agree.

98
00:06:09.410 --> 00:06:15.030
Tony Kaizen:
It sounds like you're really not happy with the effects that
social media has had on society and our culture.

99
00:06:15.250 --> 00:06:21.970
Ki:
I love social media. I think it's a necessary thing. I just
think that we should still be open to listening to others

100
00:06:22.010 --> 00:06:29.400
and conversing with others and being wrong. We should be...
Nobody can be wrong. We don't like to be wrong...when

101
00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:37.610
somebody is wrong, it's like a mob mentality. Somebody
disagrees...any disagreement is met with mob mentality so I

102
00:06:37.610 --> 00:06:44.440
may not agree with whatever the fuck he is over there,
but...but he seems like a cool guy and we can disagree on

103
00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:46.160
shit but, you know, different shit, right?

104
00:06:46.580 --> 00:06:50.890
Tony Kaizen:
Right. Do you think that is something that's unique to us or
maybe around the world they're kind of feeling the same

105
00:06:50.890 --> 00:06:51.250
effects?

106
00:06:52.090 --> 00:06:59.920
Ki:
It depends on the part of the world, Europe, maybe certain
parts of Europe. Umm first world problems, first world

107
00:06:59.920 --> 00:07:04.560
problems. Other people are trying to get running water,
trying to get access to water. They're not worried

108
00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:10.010
about...they're not worried about shit. I personally don't
give a shit about disagreeing with you when we've got $9

109
00:07:10.190 --> 00:07:12.560
dozen eggs, so we need to get along.

110
00:07:13.710 --> 00:07:14.660
Tony Kaizen:
How do you think that happens?

111
00:07:15.550 --> 00:07:22.880
Ki:
Umm while we're worried about other shit, inflation happens
because they can. Nobody's paying attention to that

112
00:07:23.670 --> 00:07:24.120
so...effectively.

113
00:07:25.270 --> 00:07:28.820
Tony Kaizen:
But in terms of like people coming together and
understanding each other a little bit more, where do you

114
00:07:28.820 --> 00:07:31.790
think that starts? What do we need to change or do
differently?

115
00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:35.260
Ki:
We need to start by being okay with disagreeing with each
other.

116
00:07:37.350 --> 00:07:39.370
Ki's wife:
I totally see that being...

117
00:07:39.370 --> 00:07:44.630
Ki:
Yeah. I'm going to start with being okay with the
disagreement and listening to each other and stop yelling.

118
00:07:45.770 --> 00:07:48.640
If you listen to somebody and stop yelling, then it'll be
better.

119
00:07:49.510 --> 00:07:52.580
Tony Kaizen:
So give people the chance to explain where they're coming
from and teach you how they think.

120
00:07:52.580 --> 00:07:57.140
Ki:
Yeah, where they are. Instead of forcing people to be where
you are, meeting them where they are, and being okay with

121
00:07:57.140 --> 00:07:59.100
them, staying where they are, even if you disagree.

122
00:07:59.270 --> 00:08:02.610
Tony Kaizen:
Right, right. Now, do you see this changing or getting any
better in the future?

123
00:08:03.160 --> 00:08:08.040
Ki:
Oh, it's not getting better. It's only getting worse because
more people are disagreeing. More people are forming these

124
00:08:08.040 --> 00:08:11.190
extreme opinions where they're not wrong. They're always
right.

125
00:08:12.490 --> 00:08:16.350
Tony Kaizen:
You really think there's no...where does this go, though? If
it's getting worse and worse, where do you think this ends

126
00:08:16.350 --> 00:08:16.550
up?

127
00:08:17.360 --> 00:08:25.300
Ki:
Umm it's going to a place where...if you...if you forget the
past, you're doomed to repeat it so...I could...I don't want

128
00:08:25.300 --> 00:08:31.520
to say...I don't want to say yeah, yeah...I saw your
(eye)brows. I don't want to say that. But it could be, when

129
00:08:31.520 --> 00:08:37.140
people sit in these places and when you start to call people
out and say that they're wrong, they are... Then you start

130
00:08:37.140 --> 00:08:41.160
to try to justify why they shouldn't exist. And that becomes
an extreme way of thinking.

131
00:08:41.850 --> 00:08:44.560
Tony Kaizen:
Especially with the technology and weapons we have at our
disposal these days.

132
00:08:44.560 --> 00:08:45.830
Ki:
Exactly. Exactly.

133
00:08:45.860 --> 00:08:51.540
Tony Kaizen:
Now, let me ask you this. Speaking of that, we're not going
to use the word, but in the worst case scenario, things go

134
00:08:51.540 --> 00:08:58.940
all the way to the to the worst possible scenario. Would you
feel some sense of like duty or responsibility to get

135
00:08:58.940 --> 00:09:01.750
involved and maybe fight for your country or anything of
that nature?

136
00:09:03.280 --> 00:09:05.120
Ki:
No, no.

137
00:09:05.150 --> 00:09:11.370
If I needed to fight for my country, I would. But...the duty
to fight for what, though? I would have to have a purpose.

138
00:09:11.370 --> 00:09:16.660
I'm a purpose person. So if there's...if there's no purpose
in it, why do it? I need to understand. I need understanding

139
00:09:16.700 --> 00:09:20.350
for the purpose...what we'd be fighting for, why we'd be
fighting.

140

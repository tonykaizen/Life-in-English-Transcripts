00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:07.970
What's up, my friend? This is the Life in English podcast.
And I'm your sensei, Tony Kaizen. And in this episode,

2
00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:12.130
you're going to learn the best way to deal with annoying
people.

3
00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:27.240
Audio clip:
"If only people are less irritating and annoying, then the
world will be a much better place. However, annoyance is not

4
00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:35.630
a trait someone possesses. It is actually a response which I
have. In other words, it is not accurate for me to say, 'You

5
00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:43.640
are annoying,' when I actually mean, 'I am annoyed.'
Annoyance is actually an emotional indicator, revealing that

6
00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:51.550
others have fall short of the standard of my desires. The
key to dealing with your feelings of annoyance is to

7
00:00:51.610 --> 00:01:00.660
distinguish between personal preferences and matters of
principles, between inconvenience and matters of conviction.

8
00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:08.040
If you do not know when to be flexible and when to be firm,
it is no wonder that you are constantly annoyed with people

9
00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:14.840
and with life. Next time you feel annoyed, don't let it lead
you to judging others, but use it as an opportunity to

10
00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:18.600
examine your own heart's intentions. Think about it."

11
00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:26.360
Alright, my friends. Now I just wanna explain a couple of
keywords and phrases to help you sound more natural in your

12
00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:33.530
next conversation, alright? So the first word I want to
explain is "annoyance". Annoyance is "the feeling or the

13
00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:42.610
state of being annoyed". So what you...you feel annoyance or
you feel annoyed when someone is annoying you. Hopefully

14
00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:50.640
that makes sense. Now, another meaning of annoyance is
something or someone that annoys you. Right? Or a nuisance.

15
00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:58.360
So somebody can be an annoyance or this thing can be an
annoyance, which means someone or something that annoys

16
00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:03.010
people. Probably you, in this case, right? Next.

17
00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:05.880
The word "trait". T-r-a-i-t.

18
00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:13.650
Trait. This word means, "a distinguishing quality or
characteristic, typically one belonging to a person," right?

19
00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:20.630
So "annoying" is not a trait. It's not something that people
possess. It's really, what you mean to say is you feel

20
00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:27.810
annoyed, which is a state of being, and it's about you, not
the thing that you see as annoying. Hopefully that makes

21
00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:34.070
sense, right? So the next word is "accurate". I believe he
said something like, "It's not accurate to say you are

22
00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:42.270
annoying. I should say I feel or I am annoyed." And
"accurate" just means "correct" in all details, or "precise"

23
00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:49.200
is another word that you can use. Now the next word I want
to explain is "indicator". And this just means, "a thing,

24
00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:56.630
especially a trend or a fact that indicates the state or
level of something." Now, this dictionary definition, I

25
00:02:56.630 --> 00:03:03.400
don't know if it's the clearest thing in the world. So an
indicator is typically a thing, a fact or a piece of

26
00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:11.910
information that lets you know or gives you information
about a specific situation or topic or subject. Like, for

27
00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:19.780
example, if you can understand comedy and jokes in a foreign
language, that's an indicator, that's a sign, that's a bit

28
00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:26.130
of information that lets you know you're starting to reach
an advanced level. You see what I'm saying? Alright. So the

29
00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:33.290
next word is "revealing". And this just means, "making
interesting or significant information known, especially

30
00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:40.060
about a person's attitude or character." So if a piece of
information is revealing, if a situation is revealing, it

31
00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:46.850
means through that information or that situation, you end up
discovering something important or useful, right? Because

32
00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:53.580
"to reveal something" means to kind of take it out from the
shadows and put it in the light for it to be seen. You see

33
00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:59.710
what I'm saying? So if something is revealing, you can have
that image in your mind of this information or this person

34
00:03:59.710 --> 00:04:09.000
or situation taking this hidden piece of information out
from the darkness and into the light so you can see it. I

35
00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:15.660
hope that makes sense to you. Alright. Next on the list is
"falling short" and the phrasal verb is "fall short" or the

36
00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:21.230
expression, let's say, is to "fall short". And what that
means is "to fail to reach your target or to fail to meet

37
00:04:21.230 --> 00:04:28.520
someone's expectations." So if you fall short of my
expectations, it means you do not reach them. You didn't

38
00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:35.100
get...you weren't able to reach the level or the standard or
the expectation I set for you. That's what it means to fall

39
00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:37.090
short. Alright.

40
00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:43.430
Next is "standard". Now, you might know this word; it's not
necessarily advanced, but in this case, "standard" means "a

41
00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:51.130
principle of conduct informed by notions of honor and
decency." So it's like, the set of guidelines or rules or a

42
00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:59.000
code that you have a particular philosophy and way of being
that you have. That's your standard of being, right? So just

43
00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:04.360
because somebody doesn't meet your particular standard,
which is yours, it doesn't mean that they are annoying. It

44
00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:11.000
just means you are annoyed because somebody has not met your
standards. But it's not about them. It's about you, right?

45
00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:18.020
That's the idea that I understood at least. Okay, so the
next word on the list is "distinguish". Distinguish just

46
00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:25.810
means to perceive or point out a difference, to notice the
difference, or to be able to differentiate two things, two

47
00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:32.430
or more things, let's say. So you need to be able to
distinguish an annoying person from you feeling annoyed. You

48
00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:40.330
need to be able to differentiate your expectations from
people's responsibility to meet those expectations. Those

49
00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:48.150
are two completely different things and you need to be able
to distinguish or differentiate them. Right? Okay. Next is

50
00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:51.520
"matters", m-a-t-t-e-r-s, matters.

51
00:05:52.010 --> 00:05:58.510
And this word has multiple meanings. But in this context, a
"matter" is "an affair or a situation under consideration".

52
00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:05.630
In other words, it's a topic or...or just a situation in
general. So if it's a "matter of principles", you can also

53
00:06:05.630 --> 00:06:14.940
say it's a "question of principle". It's a...a situation
that deals with or that is related to principle. So if this

54
00:06:14.940 --> 00:06:20.600
is a "matter of life and death", it means it's a "situation
that involves life and death". You see what I'm saying? It's

55
00:06:20.660 --> 00:06:27.810
all about that specifically. Hopefully that makes sense.
Alright? Now, the next word is "inconvenience". And this

56
00:06:27.810 --> 00:06:33.930
just means, "trouble or difficulty caused to one's personal
requirements or comfort". So if something is inconvenient,

57
00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:40.630
it basically makes you uncomfortable for some reason, not
just physically or emotionally, it could be any form of

58
00:06:40.630 --> 00:06:48.310
discomfort. So, for example, you might be talking with your
friends at the park and I might inconvenience you all by

59
00:06:48.310 --> 00:06:53.940
stopping your conversation to try and sell you something.
It's like you're at the park just trying to enjoy the day,

60
00:06:53.940 --> 00:06:58.280
hang out with your friends, it's your only day off this
week, you don't want somebody trying to sell you some shit

61
00:06:58.380 --> 00:07:05.080
at the park. That's an inconvenience. It's ruining your good
time, your comfortable time with your friends, you know?

62
00:07:06.300 --> 00:07:13.380
Alright, the next word is "conviction". And conviction is
just "a firmly held belief or opinion". That's all it means.

63
00:07:13.610 --> 00:07:21.900
So if you feel conviction, it means you feel, uh, what's the
word I can use? You feel very confident in whatever it is

64
00:07:21.900 --> 00:07:28.500
that you believe. You feel conviction. You feel certain of
what it is you believe. Basically, that's what it means,

65
00:07:28.650 --> 00:07:34.600
okay? Now the next word is "flexible" and this word can
change a little bit depending on the context, because you

66
00:07:34.600 --> 00:07:41.690
have physically flexible like people that do yoga. I have so
much respect for people that do yoga. Ever since I tried

67
00:07:41.690 --> 00:07:49.070
yoga and found out like how difficult that shit actually is.
But anyway, "flexible". Physically, you can stretch in, you

68
00:07:49.070 --> 00:07:56.080
know, strange ways and you can put your body in very
unnatural positions because you can stretch your limbs and

69
00:07:56.080 --> 00:08:03.250
body parts, you know, more than the average person. You are
flexible. You're not stiff and stuck like a machine or a

70
00:08:03.250 --> 00:08:10.530
robot, you see what I'm saying? But in this context,
"flexible" just means, "to be ready and able to change or

71
00:08:10.630 --> 00:08:17.340
adapt to different circumstances or a different situation".
You see what I'm saying? You can "roll with the punches", as

72
00:08:17.340 --> 00:08:23.350
we say. That's another expression, which basically just
means you can adapt quickly, right? So we're in this

73
00:08:23.350 --> 00:08:28.960
situation, but bam, something changes and immediately, "I'm
not gonna cry, I'm not gonna panic, I'm not gonna get

74
00:08:28.960 --> 00:08:35.080
stressed. I can just keep moving. I go with the flow", you
know, "I roll with the punches. I'm very flexible. I'm

75
00:08:35.080 --> 00:08:44.420
adaptable." Okay, next...it is no matter that...or excuse
me, I said that completely wrong. Next on the list is "it is

76
00:08:44.420 --> 00:08:54.190
no wonder that" and this expression is used to say that
"it's not surprising at all or it's not unexpected at all".

77
00:08:54.650 --> 00:09:01.200
So I think he said something like, "If you don't know when
to be flexible and firm, it's no wonder that you're

78
00:09:01.200 --> 00:09:07.560
constantly annoyed with people and with life." So when he
says, "it's no wonder..." Let me just replace that phrase

79
00:09:07.560 --> 00:09:14.680
with...with another definition. I could say, "If you don't
know how to be flexible and firm or when to be flexible and

80
00:09:14.680 --> 00:09:20.360
firm," you know, "it's no surprise that you're always
annoyed with people in life." You see what I'm saying?

81
00:09:20.360 --> 00:09:24.740
That's what it means when somebody says, "Oh, no wonder."
It's like, "Oh, it's no surprise." Like, "obviously", you

82
00:09:25.050 --> 00:09:34.170
see what I'm saying? Alright. Next on the list is "lead to".
Let me go back and see exactly what he said. "The next time

83
00:09:34.170 --> 00:09:40.590
you feel annoyed, don't let it lead to you judging others,"
that's what he said. So "lead to" in this case means "to

84
00:09:40.590 --> 00:09:47.740
result in something". So the next time you feel annoyed,
don't let that feeling of annoyance result in you judging

85
00:09:47.740 --> 00:09:54.530
other people. Don't let your judgment of other people be the
result of you feeling annoyed. Choose to react a different

86
00:09:54.530 --> 00:10:00.320
way to that feeling is the idea, okay? And last but not
least on the list is "examine", and you probably know what

87
00:10:00.320 --> 00:10:05.880
this means. But just in case you don't, it just means "to
inspect in great detail". If you examine your heart's

88
00:10:05.880 --> 00:10:13.890
intentions, it means you take a real hard look at your own
heart, at yourself, and try to find all the details and

89
00:10:13.890 --> 00:10:19.900
things that need to be changed, right? You're investigating
something thoroughly. That's the idea of "examine", okay?

90
00:10:20.340 --> 00:10:27.440
So, my friend, I want you to remember that you will always,
always, always come across difficult people and situations

91
00:10:27.750 --> 00:10:34.880
in this life, and you have absolutely no control over that.
I know it can be hard sometimes, but I found that if you can

92
00:10:34.880 --> 00:10:42.750
manage to detach yourself from your idea of the way things
and people should be and just accept the way things are,

93
00:10:43.790 --> 00:10:51.420
life gets so much easier, simpler, and less stressful. I'm
obviously not saying you should always do nothing. There are

94
00:10:51.420 --> 00:10:57.550
times when someone or something is bothering you and you
need to do something in order to make it stop. I'm just

95
00:10:57.550 --> 00:11:07.500
saying that accepting what you can't control leads to inner
peace. And we all want inner peace, right? I'd like

96
00:11:07.500 --> 00:11:12.720
to think so. So, my friend, I'd like to thank you for your
time and your attention. I really hope you enjoyed this

97
00:11:12.740 --> 00:11:19.790
episode of The Life in English podcast. I'm your host, Tony
Kaizen, and I will talk to you soon. Peace!

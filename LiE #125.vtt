12
00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:46.340
There are many ways to use the English word 'bitch'.

13
00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:57.010
It can be used to describe a man, a woman, a child, a dog, an inanimate object. Just depends on the context.

14
00:00:57.810 --> 00:01:04.190
I'm going to play a clip that I saw online the other day in which this guy, Wes Watson, is going to define the word bitch.

15
00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.080
It's one of my favorite ways to use the word, by the way.

16
00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.650
And as always, we're not going to waste any time here.

17
00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:14.360
I'm going to play the clip, explain a few things to you, and then we'll get out of here. All right?

18
00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:17.970
So let me go ahead and play this clip. All right, here we go.

19
00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:23.470
INTERVIEWER:
What's a bitch mean? What does that qualify someone to make that?

20
00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:28.130
WES WATSON:
Just a bitch, like someone who's just putting themselves through something they don't want.

21
00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:32.330
A set of circumstances that they don't want and then fucking crying about it, bitching about it.

22
00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:35.090
INTERVIEWER:
Their actions aren't congruent with their desires or mission.

23
00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:38.470
WES WATSON:
Their daily habits are not in line with the future they desire.

24
00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:41.820
Their daily habits are out of whack, and then they're wondering why it's happening to them.

25
00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:43.380
They're acting like it's happening to them.

26
00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:45.130
It's like, you're fucking doing it.

27
00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:50.600
TONY KAIZEN:
All right. Now, like I always say, if it was difficult for you

28
00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:55.760
To follow that little dialogue or understand every word or phrase that was said, don't worry about it.

29
00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:00.550
You know, there's things that were said that, one, were grammatically incorrect

30
00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:02.790
Or just words or phrases that you wouldn't learn in school.

31
00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:07.160
So naturally, you wouldn't understand everything all the time. All right?

32
00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:13.570
So I just always like to repeat that fact, which is there's no reason to feel bad about that. All right?

33
00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:20.340
So now I'm about to explain everything that was said from start to finish so that you can understand everything all the time.

34
00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:21.500
All right? So let's do it.

35
00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:24.330
We're going to listen to the clip again, piece by piece.

36
00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:29.370
And if you're watching this on YouTube, you can see I've highlighted certain things in certain colors.

37
00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:33.210
Because sometimes I'm going to talk about grammar, other times about vocabulary,

38
00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:36.290
Other times about culture and sometimes about pronunciation.

39
00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:40.050
So you can see the different colors just so it's easier to follow along.

40
00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:43.840
But anyway, we're going to play the clip again, piece by piece.

41
00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:48.970
I'm going to explain things that were said, different ways of saying the same thing, explain some vocabulary,

42
00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:52.710
And things like that. And like I said, then we'll get out of here.

43
00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:53.800
All right, so let's do it.

44
00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:57.220
Let me go all the way back to the beginning of the clip.

45
00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:01.680
And let's listen to it line by line. Here we go.

46
00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:07.310
INTERVIEWER:
What's a bitch mean? What does qualify someone to make that?

47
00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:13.380
TONY KAIZEN:
All right, so the interviewer, I don't know his name, but he asked two questions.

48
00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:15.300
Really the same question, but he asked it twice.

49
00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:20.890
So first he said, "What's a bitch mean?" Now, although we can understand the question,

50
00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:24.580
Obviously the person being interviewed understood the question and responded.

51
00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:28.920
But "what's a bitch mean?" is a grammatically incorrect way of forming a question.

52
00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:30.490
So you have two options.

53
00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:32.620
You can say,"What is a bitch?"

54
00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:35.390
Or "What does bitch mean?".

55
00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:37.370
All right? Let me repeat that.

56
00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:40.910
What is a bitch? All right? What's the definition?

57
00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:42.530
What is a bitch? How would you define it?

58
00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:45.180
Or what does bitch mean?

59
00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:48.180
So what is this thing or what does this thing mean?

60
00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:51.140
What is this word or what does this word mean?

61
00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:55.720
You wouldn't say, "what's this thing mean?" "What's a bitch mean?".

62
00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:59.220
Grammatically, it's incorrect, and it sounds weird. You know what I mean?

63
00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:02.560
We can understand it, but it just sounds weird, at least to me.

64
00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:06.550
So then he says, "What does that qualify someone to make that?".

65
00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:10.960
Now, this sentence makes absolutely no sense.

66
00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:15.210
I shouldn't say that because we can understand what he's asking based on the context.

67
00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:19.330
But the sentence itself, "what does that qualify someone to make that?".

68
00:04:20.830 --> 00:04:22.990
I don't know what the fuck that actually means.

69
00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:27.490
Like, I know what it means because of the context, and he's again, he's asking the question a different way.

70
00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:31.820
Because he starts by saying, "What is a bitch?" or "What does bitch mean?".

71
00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:36.380
And with the second sentence, what I believe he was trying to say is, you know,

72
00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:41.810
What qualifies someone as a bitch or what makes someone a bitch.

73
00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:48.090
That's what I believe he was trying to ask, but I'm really not 100% sure because the question is formed in such a strange way.

74
00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:51.890
It's almost like he wanted to ask the question in two different ways,

75
00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:55.120
And they both came out at the same time in the same sentence. You know what I mean?

76
00:04:55.460 --> 00:05:00.240
So if you got confused when you heard that, don't feel bad because this is my first language and I was like,

77
00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:04.060
"What the fuck is this? What the fuck does that mean? What is he trying to say?".

78
00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:07.500
You know? So anyway, now you should understand.

79
00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:10.050
He just asked the same question two different ways,

80
00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:14.050
And both ways were kind of like, grammatically incorrect, and they sound strange.

81
00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:17.070
So you can say "What is a bitch?"

82
00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:18.310
"What does bitch mean?"

83
00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:21.460
"What qualifies someone as a bitch?"

84
00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:24.660
Or "How does someone be qualified as a bitch?"

85
00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:26.200
Or "What makes someone a bitch?".

86
00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:26.970
You see what I'm saying?

87
00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:28.830
Those are ways that you can ask that question.

88
00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:33.070
So let's go to the next line and hear Wes's response.

89
00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:42.040
WES WATSON:
Just a bitch, like someone who's just putting themselves through something they don't want.

90
00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:44.690
TONY KAIZEN:
Okay, so the interviewer asked,

91
00:05:44.910 --> 00:05:46.160
"What's a bitch? What does that mean?"

92
00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:48.000
And Wes responds, saying,

93
00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:52.320
"Just a bitch, like someone who is putting themselves through something they don't want"

94
00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:55.550
So the first thing I want to bring to your attention is the word 'like'.

95
00:05:55.940 --> 00:05:57.610
Because the word like is a verb, right?

96
00:05:57.610 --> 00:06:00.180
I like pizza, I like video games, etc.

97
00:06:00.570 --> 00:06:05.170
But in this case, we use 'like' almost as a way... it's like a filler word.

98
00:06:05.670 --> 00:06:07.130
As you see, I just used the word like.

99
00:06:07.910 --> 00:06:12.230
So in this case, he says, "Just a bitch, like" and you'll notice a lot of Americans,

100
00:06:12.230 --> 00:06:16.360
We say 'like' a lot when we're trying to think of what we're going to say next. You know?

101
00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:22.250
"I don't know, like, it was just cool like this, like big, like green, like car".

102
00:06:22.250 --> 00:06:22.930
You know what I'm saying?

103
00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:27.530
So I'm saying 'like' a bunch of times just filling the spaces in between my words,

104
00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:31.040
Because I'm still trying to figure out exactly which words I want to use.

105
00:06:31.510 --> 00:06:33.190
I'm trying to figure out exactly what I want to say.

106
00:06:33.190 --> 00:06:39.320
So I say the word 'like' kind of to fill those empty spaces while I'm thinking. You see what I'm saying?

107
00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:45.950
So he says, "just a bitch, like someone who is just putting themselves through something that they don't want".

108
00:06:46.370 --> 00:06:50.440
So the next thing I want to explain is "putting themselves through something that they don't want".

109
00:06:51.080 --> 00:06:56.580
So the phrase is "to put someone through something", in this case, "to put oneself through something".

110
00:06:56.950 --> 00:07:01.520
And all that means is to make or to cause someone to experience something.

111
00:07:02.070 --> 00:07:07.890
So if I'm putting myself through a situation, I am causing myself to experience this particular situation.

112
00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:13.360
If I'm putting you through a difficult experience or if I'm putting you through something difficult,

113
00:07:13.750 --> 00:07:16.090
I'm making you experience something difficult.

114
00:07:16.090 --> 00:07:18.970
Because to go through something means to experience something.

115
00:07:19.640 --> 00:07:23.480
So if I put you through something, I'm just making you go through something.

116
00:07:24.270 --> 00:07:25.150
Hopefully that makes sense.

117
00:07:25.150 --> 00:07:28.000
Because to do it alone, I'm going through this situation.

118
00:07:28.440 --> 00:07:34.130
But if somebody else is making me or causing me to go through the situation, they are putting me through the situation.

119
00:07:34.460 --> 00:07:39.280
Hopefully, you can understand the difference between me saying "I'm going through" and "someone else is putting me through".

120
00:07:40.220 --> 00:07:45.600
The same thing is happening, it's just two different people are causing it to happen when we use those two different words.

121
00:07:47.120 --> 00:07:50.410
I hope that makes sense. Now let's continue next line.

122
00:07:54.210 --> 00:07:58.360
WES WATSON:
A set of circumstances that they don't want and then fucking crying about it, bitching about it.

123
00:07:59.380 --> 00:08:04.240
TONY KAIZEN:
Okay, so just a bitch, someone who's putting themselves through something that they don't want,

124
00:08:04.690 --> 00:08:06.830
A set of circumstances that they don't want.

125
00:08:06.920 --> 00:08:09.850
Now, I just wanted to explain really quickly "a set of".

126
00:08:10.220 --> 00:08:11.780
He said, "a set of circumstances".

127
00:08:12.820 --> 00:08:19.990
This really just means a group of circumstances or a number of circumstances, just multiple circumstances.

128
00:08:19.990 --> 00:08:27.280
You see what I'm saying? A set of is a slightly more formal way of saying the same thing.

129
00:08:27.530 --> 00:08:33.770
And then he says, "then after putting themselves through something that they don't want, they fucking cry about it".

130
00:08:34.380 --> 00:08:36.620
He said, "fucking crying about it". You see what I'm saying?

131
00:08:36.620 --> 00:08:43.600
And in that case, the word 'fucking' it's like, used to put emphasis on something, typically a verb.

132
00:08:44.890 --> 00:08:47.200
I don't know if it's always a verb, but many times it's a verb.

133
00:08:47.310 --> 00:08:50.560
So he's saying, "and then they're fucking crying about it" so he's putting emphasis

134
00:08:51.270 --> 00:08:55.290
And showing that he's a little bit frustrated by the fact that they're crying about it. See?

135
00:08:55.290 --> 00:08:58.370
They put themselves through the situation and then they fucking cry about it.

136
00:08:59.050 --> 00:09:03.310
You know, you can tell by the way he speaks and by him saying, "fucking crying" he's a little irritated.

137
00:09:03.700 --> 00:09:04.260
You see what I'm saying?

138
00:09:04.600 --> 00:09:09.180
And then he says, "bitching about it", which is kind of the same thing. You see?

139
00:09:09.730 --> 00:09:16.840
Because to cry about something literally means to, you know, shed tears because you're sad or frustrated or whatever about this situation.

140
00:09:17.850 --> 00:09:23.480
And then to bitch about something is a little more specific because you might cry because there's a genuine reason to cry.

141
00:09:23.830 --> 00:09:26.770
But if you're crying like a little baby, if you're bitching about something,

142
00:09:26.770 --> 00:09:31.160
It means you acting like a bitch, like a weak individual. You see what I'm saying?

143
00:09:31.160 --> 00:09:34.860
You're crying about something that you could actually change or control.

144
00:09:34.860 --> 00:09:38.320
But instead of doing that and putting in the effort and the work,

145
00:09:38.320 --> 00:09:40.800
You just decide to cry like a child who is helpless.

146
00:09:41.660 --> 00:09:42.740
You know? Like a bitch.

147
00:09:43.390 --> 00:09:47.750
And that kind of gives you a better idea of what 'bitch' means or another way to use the word bitch.

148
00:09:48.090 --> 00:09:55.380
Because a lot of times we use the word bitch to just describe a weak individual, a coward. You know what I'm saying?

149
00:09:55.380 --> 00:10:00.130
Somebody who prefers to cry and wait for somebody to come save them,

150
00:10:00.130 --> 00:10:04.030
As opposed to somebody who's going to make change or make something happen.

151
00:10:05.680 --> 00:10:09.100
I don't know if that makes any sense, I've never I don't think I've ever explained that before.

152
00:10:09.100 --> 00:10:13.360
But hopefully you can get the idea. To be bitching means to be acting like a bitch.

153
00:10:13.380 --> 00:10:19.060
And in this context, to act like a bitch is just like this whiny, little weak individual who's crying like a baby,

154
00:10:19.060 --> 00:10:23.720
Acting like a child instead of an adult that can take care of themselves. You see?

155
00:10:24.930 --> 00:10:27.980
So they're putting themselves through this difficult situation.

156
00:10:28.610 --> 00:10:32.700
Then they fucking cry and bitch about it like a victim, like a bitch.

157
00:10:32.700 --> 00:10:35.700
You see what I'm saying? All right, let's go to the next line.

158
00:10:39.520 --> 00:10:42.280
INTERVIEWER:
Their actions aren't congruent with their desires or mission.

159
00:10:42.410 --> 00:10:45.670
WES WATSON:
Their daily habits are not in line with the future they desire.

160
00:10:46.680 --> 00:10:50.720
TONY KAIZEN:
All right. So I played two lines, the interviewer and Wes Watson for a good reason.

161
00:10:51.150 --> 00:10:52.180
First, the interview says,

162
00:10:52.210 --> 00:10:56.100
"their actions aren't congruent with their desires or mission".

163
00:10:56.370 --> 00:10:59.940
It's the first thing. The second line, he says, or Wes says,

164
00:11:00.530 --> 00:11:02.990
"their daily habits are not in line with the future they desire".

165
00:11:02.990 --> 00:11:06.400
So if you pay attention, they said the same exact thing just in a different way.

166
00:11:06.690 --> 00:11:09.040
One was a little more formal, one was a little less formal.

167
00:11:09.040 --> 00:11:09.780
So let me explain.

168
00:11:10.460 --> 00:11:12.950
Sentence number one, their actions are not congruent.

169
00:11:13.330 --> 00:11:20.260
So if we look for 'congruent', the actual definition. Congruent... I'm searching this on BING,

170
00:11:20.970 --> 00:11:23.330
Just in case you can't see what I'm doing and you're only listening.

171
00:11:23.790 --> 00:11:27.680
So the definition of congruent, in agreement or harmony. Right?

172
00:11:28.740 --> 00:11:34.820
So their actions are not in agreement or in harmony with their desires or mission. That's what the interviewer said.

173
00:11:35.200 --> 00:11:36.260
Then Wes says,

174
00:11:36.300 --> 00:11:40.010
"their daily habits are not in line with the future they desire".

175
00:11:40.620 --> 00:11:53.530
So let's define "in line with". In line with, in alignment or accordance with.

176
00:11:54.610 --> 00:11:58.370
Basically, the same thing as in order or in harmony with. You see what I'm saying?

177
00:11:58.370 --> 00:12:00.120
So they both said the same thing.

178
00:12:00.770 --> 00:12:03.120
Their actions aren't congruent with their desires or mission,

179
00:12:03.150 --> 00:12:09.850
Which means their actions are not in line with or in agreement with or in harmony with their desires or their mission.

180
00:12:10.310 --> 00:12:12.970
Their daily habits are not in line with the future they desire,

181
00:12:13.220 --> 00:12:17.810
Which means the things they do every day are not congruent with the future they desire.

182
00:12:17.880 --> 00:12:19.980
It's not in harmony with. You see what I'm saying?

183
00:12:19.980 --> 00:12:23.920
So to be congruent with or to be in line with is the same exact thing.

184
00:12:24.250 --> 00:12:29.340
"To be in line with" is just more informal, it's more natural.

185
00:12:29.340 --> 00:12:32.490
"Congruent" is a more advanced word, it's a little more formal.

186
00:12:32.490 --> 00:12:38.480
It's not something that I think you would hear every day in the street or just talking, you know, in regular conversation.

187
00:12:38.740 --> 00:12:42.380
But in line with to me, is much more natural. It's a more informal option.

188
00:12:42.760 --> 00:12:44.680
All right? So let's get to this last line.

189
00:12:48.190 --> 00:12:53.330
WES WATSON:
Their daily habits are not in line with the future they desire, their daily habits are out of whack, and then...

190
00:12:54.500 --> 00:12:58.110
TONY KAIZEN:
Their daily habits are out of whack, out of whack.

191
00:12:59.870 --> 00:13:05.750
To be out of whack is like, to be disorganized or not orderly or something like that.

192
00:13:06.160 --> 00:13:09.970
Let me actually do a quick search just to confirm that.

193
00:13:09.970 --> 00:13:17.520
Out of whack. "Out of whack" means out of order or not working.

194
00:13:17.780 --> 00:13:21.350
So if we go back to the phrase "their daily habits are out of whack".

195
00:13:22.670 --> 00:13:26.940
That just means their daily habits are out of order, disorganized. There's no structure.

196
00:13:26.940 --> 00:13:29.030
You see what I'm saying? There's no routine.

197
00:13:29.030 --> 00:13:31.770
There's no goal that we're trying to achieve or anything like that.

198
00:13:33.080 --> 00:13:36.060
So if something is out of whack it just means dysfunctional,

199
00:13:36.260 --> 00:13:40.880
Out of order, not working, no structure, or anything like that. Okay?

200
00:13:41.200 --> 00:13:44.810
Out of whack, out of control. So let's go to the next line.

201
00:13:48.380 --> 00:13:50.430
WES WATSON:
...whack and then they're wondering why it's happening to them.

202
00:13:50.670 --> 00:13:51.930
They're acting like it's happening to them.

203
00:13:51.930 --> 00:13:53.910
TONY KAIZEN:
All right. So he says,

204
00:13:53.910 --> 00:14:00.550
"their daily habits are out of whack and then they're wondering why it's happening to him. They act like it's happening to them".

205
00:14:01.400 --> 00:14:04.120
So when he says, "they're wondering why it's happening to him",

206
00:14:04.410 --> 00:14:10.830
The word 'wondering' is like, asking yourself a question because you're curious about something.

207
00:14:10.830 --> 00:14:13.990
If you wonder, it means that you want to know more about something. Right?

208
00:14:13.990 --> 00:14:19.570
So they're asking themselves or they're curious to know, why is this happening to me? That's what he's saying.

209
00:14:19.910 --> 00:14:23.450
Then he follows that sentence by saying, "they act like it's happening to them".

210
00:14:24.620 --> 00:14:30.000
So if you're not, if you're not paying attention, maybe you would think he said the same thing twice,

211
00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:35.460
Which he kind of did, but when he said it the second time, he put emphasis on the word "to". You see?

212
00:14:35.530 --> 00:14:36.340
So let me say it again.

213
00:14:37.710 --> 00:14:41.030
Their daily habits are out of whack, and then they're wondering why it's happening to them.

214
00:14:41.740 --> 00:14:43.140
They act like it's happening to them.

215
00:14:43.710 --> 00:14:46.400
So when I put emphasis on the word "to" in the second sentence,

216
00:14:46.910 --> 00:14:52.940
I'm putting emphasis on the fact that they believe that this is something that's out of their control and it's just happening to them.

217
00:14:53.010 --> 00:14:54.190
They're just receiving the action.

218
00:14:54.650 --> 00:14:57.270
Then the next sentence, which I'll play in just a second.

219
00:14:57.270 --> 00:14:59.350
He says, "it's like, you're fucking doing it".

220
00:15:00.630 --> 00:15:02.010
Okay, so hopefully you're still following me.

221
00:15:02.010 --> 00:15:05.790
I'm going to play the last three sentences and then hopefully you understand what I'm trying to say.

222
00:15:10.420 --> 00:15:12.100
WES WATSON:
And then they're wondering why it's happening to them.

223
00:15:12.340 --> 00:15:15.410
They're acting like it's happening to them. It's like, you're fucking doing it.

224
00:15:16.940 --> 00:15:20.060
TONY KAIZEN:
Okay. So let me try again to explain the main idea here.

225
00:15:20.060 --> 00:15:24.010
He's saying, "their daily habits are out of whack, out of control, disorganized,

226
00:15:24.010 --> 00:15:27.670
And then they wonder why this thing is happening to them.

227
00:15:28.490 --> 00:15:31.920
They act like it's happening to them, but it's like, you're fucking doing it".

228
00:15:32.380 --> 00:15:36.910
Okay, so they wonder why it's happening to them. That's number one.

229
00:15:36.910 --> 00:15:41.630
Then they act like it's happening to them, like something is being done to them by some external force.

230
00:15:42.390 --> 00:15:45.640
But no, you're fucking doing it. You're making it happen.

231
00:15:45.740 --> 00:15:46.590
It's really what he's saying.

232
00:15:46.980 --> 00:15:52.710
So let me go back and explain that last sentence because he says "it's like, you're fucking doing it".

233
00:15:54.540 --> 00:15:57.060
And in this case, he's not saying "it's as if you're fucking doing it",

234
00:15:57.060 --> 00:16:01.240
Because that is one translation or synonym for like, it can also be "as if".

235
00:16:01.740 --> 00:16:04.280
But in this case, he said, "it's like you're fucking doing it".

236
00:16:04.730 --> 00:16:11.180
When we say "it's like", it's kind of like a little phrase that we use to start our sentences

237
00:16:12.670 --> 00:16:17.840
When we're expressing what we would say to the person to which we are referring.

238
00:16:18.070 --> 00:16:21.570
I know that might not make a lot of sense after hearing myself explain it.

239
00:16:21.630 --> 00:16:23.090
But let me give you an example.

240
00:16:24.890 --> 00:16:32.580
You know, a lot of people think if they just eat healthy, then they'll lose all that weight.

241
00:16:32.660 --> 00:16:34.610
But it's like, no, you have to also go to the gym.

242
00:16:35.620 --> 00:16:41.200
It's probably not the best example, but if you were paying attention, you heard me say "it's like, no, you have to go to the gym as well".

243
00:16:41.200 --> 00:16:48.990
And when I say it's like whatever comes after, is what I would say to the person that believes that all they have to do is eat better food.

244
00:16:49.780 --> 00:16:52.120
It's like, no, you have to do this, this and this.

245
00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:58.030
So it's just like a way of speaking that we have when I say it's like,

246
00:16:59.030 --> 00:17:05.430
And then I state my opinion or my idea it's as if I'm speaking directly to the person who has the opposing idea.

247
00:17:06.780 --> 00:17:10.170
If you pay attention, this is kind of like an advanced thing. It's very hard to explain.

248
00:17:10.170 --> 00:17:11.660
I've never tried to explain this before.

249
00:17:12.150 --> 00:17:15.810
But if you pay attention to a lot of English speakers, not just Americans,

250
00:17:15.810 --> 00:17:20.750
But just English speakers in general, you might notice that they have that way of speaking, you know.

251
00:17:21.350 --> 00:17:24.160
But for the sake of this episode and this topic, I'll leave it at that.

252
00:17:24.590 --> 00:17:29.330
If you have any questions or doubts, always send me a message or leave it in the comments.

253
00:17:29.830 --> 00:17:30.570
All right, let's continue.

254
00:17:31.230 --> 00:17:32.970
He says, "it's like, you're fucking doing it".

255
00:17:32.970 --> 00:17:38.930
So again, the word 'fucking' before the word 'doing', just putting emphasis on the fact that you are fucking doing it.

256
00:17:38.930 --> 00:17:42.690
It's not somebody else. It's not something else. It's you, you're fucking doing it.

257
00:17:43.010 --> 00:17:50.360
And when I say it that way, I'm communicating that I'm irritated, I'm frustrated with you because you're fucking doing it. You know?

258
00:17:51.910 --> 00:17:55.580
Hopefully that makes sense. It's just a way of putting emphasis on whatever it is we're saying.

259
00:17:56.030 --> 00:17:59.900
A lot of times it's a verb, but not always. Okay? So you're fucking doing it.

260
00:18:00.310 --> 00:18:05.270
And if you notice the way he pronounced "fucking doing it", he didn't say it the way I just said it.

261
00:18:05.660 --> 00:18:11.520
Because he took the G off of both words 'fucking' and 'doing'. And he said, "fuckin' doin'".

262
00:18:12.410 --> 00:18:14.220
The G is not pronounced in either one of those words

263
00:18:14.500 --> 00:18:19.100
And that allowed him to connect the words 'doing' and 'it' at the end of his sentence.

264
00:18:19.570 --> 00:18:21.440
He said, "you're fuckin' doin' it".

265
00:18:22.280 --> 00:18:24.800
He didn't say "you're fucking doing it".

266
00:18:25.410 --> 00:18:27.450
He said, "you're fuckin'doin'it!"

267
00:18:28.100 --> 00:18:30.850
Because there's no G between doing and it, he can connect them.

268
00:18:31.130 --> 00:18:35.110
You're fucking doing it. You're fucking doing it. You see what I'm saying?

269
00:18:35.700 --> 00:18:38.310
So let me play the clip one more time from start to finish.

270
00:18:38.710 --> 00:18:42.510
And hopefully, it's much more clear what's going on here.

271
00:18:42.510 --> 00:18:44.870
And hopefully, you'll be able to follow along and understand a lot better.

272
00:18:45.240 --> 00:18:46.610
All right? Let's find out.

273
00:18:49.750 --> 00:18:52.920
INTERVIEWER:
What's a bitch mean? What does that qualify someone to make that?

274
00:18:52.970 --> 00:18:57.580
WES WATSON:
Just a bitch, like someone who's just putting themselves through something they don't want.

275
00:18:57.620 --> 00:19:01.780
A set of circumstances that they don't want and then fucking crying about it, bitching about it.

276
00:19:01.780 --> 00:19:04.540
INTERVIEWER:
Their actions aren't congruent with their desires or mission.

277
00:19:04.670 --> 00:19:07.920
WES WATSON:
Their daily habits are not in line with the future they desire.

278
00:19:08.270 --> 00:19:11.270
Their daily habits are out of whack, and then they're wondering why it's happening to them.

279
00:19:11.510 --> 00:19:14.640
They're acting like it's happening to them. It's like, you're fucking doing it.

280
00:19:15.440 --> 00:19:20.440
TONY KAIZEN:
So hopefully I didn't lose you at any point during that episode, during the clip itself or the explanations,

281
00:19:20.440 --> 00:19:24.780
You know, because I tried to do my best and make sure that everything was clear.

282
00:19:24.780 --> 00:19:29.740
But there are certain things that you know, just never stopped to consider, and they're very difficult to explain.

283
00:19:29.770 --> 00:19:34.010
So if you still have doubts or questions, as always, shoot me a message or leave me a comment,

284
00:19:34.450 --> 00:19:38.820
Do whatever you got to do to get in contact with me, and I'll do my best to help you understand.

285
00:19:38.820 --> 00:19:42.260
But let me summarize the main idea of this very short, very simple clip.

286
00:19:42.910 --> 00:19:49.580
The idea is that there are so many people out there who are just complaining and bitching and crying about their circumstances,

287
00:19:49.580 --> 00:19:55.860
About their situation, about their life, their personality, their eating habits, their weight, their appearance, whatever it is.

288
00:19:56.310 --> 00:19:59.000
So many things that are actually under their control.

289
00:20:00.720 --> 00:20:05.990
And even still, they prefer to act like it's totally out of their control. You see what I'm saying?

290
00:20:06.740 --> 00:20:10.760
In Wes Watson's words and also, in my opinion, that's the definition of a bitch.

291
00:20:10.760 --> 00:20:18.420
It's just somebody who prefers to like, cry and complain as opposed to taking action and making something happen, making change. You know?

292
00:20:19.170 --> 00:20:23.720
And I don't know about you, but I just don't think it's a good idea to live your life like a bitch.

293
00:20:24.120 --> 00:20:26.660
You know, I'm sure we all have at some point I certainly have.

294
00:20:27.260 --> 00:20:31.770
And it just takes that level of self-awareness or sometimes a friend to put his arm around your shoulder and be like,

295
00:20:31.770 --> 00:20:37.230
"Listen, man, listen. You acting like a bitch right now". You know what I'm saying?

296
00:20:37.300 --> 00:20:42.200
And maybe the definition of 'bitch' still isn't clear to you because there's many definitions, like I said.

297
00:20:42.260 --> 00:20:49.470
So really a bitch is not only somebody who, you know, cries about things instead of making a change,

298
00:20:49.470 --> 00:20:54.240
It's also just somebody who acts in a cowardly way. We're describing like, a weak individual.

299
00:20:54.680 --> 00:20:55.250
You see what I'm saying?

300
00:20:55.250 --> 00:20:59.130
Somebody who acts like a helpless child or baby or something like that,

301
00:20:59.220 --> 00:21:02.800
As opposed to an adult that can take care of themselves. You know?

302
00:21:03.210 --> 00:21:05.220
So sometimes you just need that little wake-up call like,

303
00:21:05.220 --> 00:21:07.870
"Yo, you're being a bitch right now. Like, wake the fuck up".

304
00:21:08.400 --> 00:21:09.580
You know? Sometimes that's all you need.

305
00:21:09.580 --> 00:21:11.180
And maybe this episode was that for you.

306
00:21:11.970 --> 00:21:17.820
So I guess, other than getting you to understand the language in this episode of this audio clip,

307
00:21:18.560 --> 00:21:25.560
The last thing I'd like to leave you with is just encouragement to stop and like, take a moment, reflect on yourself and ask yourself like,

308
00:21:26.160 --> 00:21:29.380
What am I doing to cause unnecessary suffering in my life?

309
00:21:29.730 --> 00:21:32.050
What am I doing to cause unnecessary problems in my life?

310
00:21:32.050 --> 00:21:34.460
And how could I make those changes? You know?

311
00:21:34.720 --> 00:21:40.340
What am I always crying about or bitching about that I actually could change so that I don't have to cry or bitch about it anymore?

312
00:21:41.120 --> 00:21:44.090
You know, because sometimes people don't stop and ask themselves that.

313
00:21:44.090 --> 00:21:46.740
They really live their life thinking everything's just happening to them.

314
00:21:47.530 --> 00:21:53.890
And they really don't think or believe or even stop to wonder if the things that they do then create the reality they experience.

315
00:21:53.930 --> 00:21:54.550
You know what I'm saying?

316
00:21:54.550 --> 00:22:00.240
So if this is the first time you're hearing an idea like this, I'm happy I could be the one to share with you, you know.

317
00:22:00.240 --> 00:22:03.980
But ideas are worthless unless you apply them in a practical situation.

318
00:22:03.980 --> 00:22:08.870
So take the time to think about it, man. For Real. Really important.

319
00:22:08.870 --> 00:22:12.590
I would say like, at least once a month sit down and ask yourself, like,

320
00:22:12.590 --> 00:22:13.310
Where am I going?

321
00:22:13.430 --> 00:22:14.010
What am I doing?

322
00:22:14.010 --> 00:22:16.150
Who am I becoming? You know?

323
00:22:16.510 --> 00:22:21.530
And is that in line with who I want to be, where I want to be, what I want to be doing? Right?

324
00:22:21.700 --> 00:22:26.780
Sounds super simple, but man time feels like it's moving faster than ever.

325
00:22:26.780 --> 00:22:29.940
Like we're more, you know, occupied. We're busier than ever.

326
00:22:30.770 --> 00:22:31.930
Distracted more than ever.

327
00:22:31.930 --> 00:22:36.300
It's very easy to let weeks or months or even years pass without picking your head up and being like,

328
00:22:36.950 --> 00:22:39.810
What the fuck am I and where am I going? You know?

329
00:22:39.940 --> 00:22:44.630
So anyway, at the end of it all, I hope you enjoyed the episode.

330
00:22:44.630 --> 00:22:47.050
I hope you learned something, got something to consider and think about.

331
00:22:47.090 --> 00:22:56.170
And I hope sincerely, deeply from the bottom of my heart that you wake up and you choose not to be a bitch. All right?

332
00:22:56.510 --> 00:22:57.430
This is Life in English.

333
00:22:57.450 --> 00:23:01.200
I'm your host, Tony Kaizen. And I will talk to you very soon.

334
00:23:01.740 --> 00:23:02.450
Take care of yourself.

335
00:23:03.190 --> 00:23:03.480
Peace!

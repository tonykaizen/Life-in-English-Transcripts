00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:10.440
Let me explain the difference between "remember" and
"remind" in English. These are two words that

2
00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:15.940
many of my English students in the past and the present
constantly confuse because they have very similar meanings

3
00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:22.090
and maybe in their native languages there only exist one
word, when in English we have two words. So let me give you

4
00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:28.400
the definitions first and then I'll give you some examples.
So the definition of "remember" is to think of a memory or

5
00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:36.190
past experience; that's something that you do alone. Now,
the definition of "remind" is to make or to cause someone

6
00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:40.260
else to think of a past memory or experience.

7
00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:47.310
So let me give you some examples and hopefully it'll be more
clear. So let's start with "remember". "Hey, do you remember

8
00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:55.300
me?" "Hey, do you remember me?" So really, I'm asking you,
"Do you have any memory of me?

9
00:00:55.300 --> 00:01:04.940
Do you have any memory of who I am?" Another example, "I
will always remember my first kiss. *sighs*" "I'll always

10
00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:11.960
remember my first kiss." "I will always have the memory of
my first kiss - that past moment or experience. Nobody's

11
00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:18.030
causing me to do that, but I will always have that memory in
my mind. I will always remember it." Alright? Example number

12
00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:25.570
three, "Did you remember to pay the light bill?" "Did you
remember to pay the light bill?" So I'm asking you, did at

13
00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:31.860
any point, did the memory that you need to pay the bill into
your mind, and then, did you pay the bill? I'm sure you get

14
00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:36.650
the idea, but those are things that you do alone. Nobody's
causing you to remember these things. That's something that

15
00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:43.710
you do by yourself. That's the idea of "remember" is by
yourself, you think of this past memory or person or

16
00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:50.150
experience or thing that you need to do or whatever it is.
But the idea is that you do it by yourself. Now, let me give

17
00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:59.630
you some examples of "remind". Number one, "You remind me of
a girl I used to know", like that Usher song: "You remind me

18
00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:03.380
of a girl that I once knew.

19
00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:10.060
I see your face whenever I, I look at you." No?

20
00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:15.170
Alright. I'm gonna leave a link to that song in the
description if you watch this on YouTube. I'll leave it on

21
00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:20.700
my website, too, so definitely check out that song. It's a
good song, and it will help you understand the meaning, the

22
00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:27.510
true meaning of the word "remind". Because when I say, "You
remind me of a girl I used to know", which means, "When I

23
00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:34.350
see you, when I talk to you, when I interact with you, you
make me think of a girl I knew in the past. You make me do

24
00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:40.910
that. I'm not just thinking of my past and remembering this
girl. But you make me remember her. Which means you are

25
00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:48.340
reminding me of her." Alright, example number two, "Hey,
remind me to make a doctor's appointment for this weekend."

26
00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:55.620
So in that case, I'm saying, "I need you to make me
remember, to cause me to remember, that I need to make a

27
00:02:55.620 --> 00:03:02.780
doctor's appointment because I probably won't remember
alone. I need you to remind me or make me remember."

28
00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:11.130
Alright? Example number three, "Can you believe I had to
remind him it was my birthday?" "Can you believe I had to

29
00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:19.390
remind him it was my birthday because he didn't remember."
You see? He didn't think of it by himself. The memory didn't

30
00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:25.710
enter his mind. I had to put the idea in his mind. The
memory - I had to put it in his mind. I had to make him

31
00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:35.100
remember or I had to remind him that it was my birthday. So
in summary, the main difference between "remember" and

32
00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:43.370
"remind": "remember" is to think of a memory, a past
experience, person, place or thing by yourself; to "remind"

33
00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:52.430
is to make someone else remember or think of a past
experience, person, place, memory or thing. So hopefully now

34
00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:58.040
the difference between "remember" and "remind" is much more
clear in your head but if it's not like I always say, feel

35
00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:02.780

37

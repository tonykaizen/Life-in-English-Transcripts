Torchy Swinson:
I was going to tell you something. I just realized I've
reached the last years of my, "I'll be so glad when..." I

2
00:00:09.850 --> 00:00:16.400
wasted so much time on that. I'll be so glad when they're
out of diapers. I'll be so glad when they start school. I'll

3
00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:23.500
be so glad when they're out of school. Be so glad when
this, when that, when we can retire. If I could tell you one

4
00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:29.510
thing and I'm not trying to be that old wise woman giving
you advice, but if I could tell you one thing, don't

5
00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:35.220
postpone joy. Find your joy and what's happening today,
because that's where it lies.

What's up, my friend? The clip you just heard was of a woman
named Torchy Swinson from Midland, Texas. Now, thanks to her

7
00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:53.030
engaging stories, her vulnerable poetry, and that sweet,
sweet Southern accent, Torchy has won the hearts and minds

8
00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:59.270
of countless people around the world, including myself. She
popped up on my For You Page of TikTok the other day, and

9
00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:05.610
after hearing the clip I just played for you, I went to her
profile, and I found myself listening to story after story

10
00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:12.610
being told by this sweet old lady with such a vivid memory
and a poetic way of speaking. So, I just had to share a

11
00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:20.010
little bit of her story with you, my friend. Please go check
out her videos on TikTok @torchyswinson2. That's

12
00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:28.790
T-O-R-C-H-Y-S-W-I-N-S-O-N and the number two-
@torchyswinson2.

13
00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:36.610
Alright? Now, in episode #98 of this podcast, I played a
clip of a woman talking about this idea called Destination

14
00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:43.220
Addiction, which is basically this tendency to live in the
future, constantly anticipating this imaginary moment when

15
00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:51.390
everything will be perfect and we'll be truly happy and
satisfied with life. And that's exactly what Torchy was

16
00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:59.270
talking about in the clip I just played for you. Always in a
rush to get to the next step. So anxious for things to be

17
00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:08.520
better than they are right now. So in love with the idea of
life being exactly the way we want it to be. But by lusting

18
00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:16.200
after this idea of being happy in the future, we sacrificed
the possibility of being happy in the present moment. And we

19
00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:22.320
see this play out in so many areas of life, right? Torchy
talked about being in a rush to see her kids grow up and

20
00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:28.610
dreaming about the day she would retire. But now that her
kids are grown and she has retired, now that she's reached

21
00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:36.620
her desired destination, she's found herself wondering if
she took the journey for granted. Now I know I'm guilty of

22
00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:43.330
being in a rush to learn certain things and achieve certain
goals and arrive at certain places in life. There have been

23
00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:51.230
times when I was so hyperfixated on some future experience
that I would go months at a time without stopping to think

24
00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:59.270
about and process or even just enjoy my daily life. And even
if I eventually reached a particular goal, I would look back

25
00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:08.450
on the experience and I would see and feel nothing. As if
the entire experience had no meaning. All I could think

26
00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:15.960
about was picking a new destination. And what's the point of
that? What's the point of doing all this shit if I'm not

27
00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:22.480
gonna be present and make the most of it? What's the point
of doing all this shit if I'm not going to enjoy or even

28
00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:30.810
remember any of it? So that's something I've really been
working on lately, man. Just trying to be present in every

29
00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:37.820
moment and find a way to enjoy it. Just accepting reality
and going with the natural flow of things, you know?

30
00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:48.160
All we have is the present moment, my friend. And I know it
can be difficult to live in the moment when you're unhappy

31
00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:54.840
with yourself or your life. Sometimes it's difficult to be
happy when things aren't going the way you want them to go.

32
00:03:56.200 --> 00:04:02.760
But I want you to remember one thing. You're going to die
one day and it's probably going to happen sooner than you

33
00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:11.600
think and what that means is you've got a finite amount of
time left and you're the only one who can decide how you're

34
00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:18.800
going to spend it.

1
00:00:01.540 --> 00:00:03.060
(Let's) see if we can get this in one take.

2
00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:07.500
What's up, everybody? You are listening to another episode of Life in English.

3
00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:08.840
I'm your host, Tony Kaizen.

4
00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:14.830
And in this episode, I'm going to talk about some universal truths of learning a language.

5
00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:18.510
There are a bunch of different methods, tools, courses, YouTube channels,

6
00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:25.770
And podcasts that claim to have the secret to fluency or some, you know, revolutionary study method.

7
00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:30.980
But at the end of the day, there are some things about the learning process that will never change,

8
00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:37.690
And that's what I'm here to talk about today. Let's do it.

9
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.520
The Life in English podcast is designed to teach you the real American English that you won't learn in school,

10
00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.690

You can visit lifeinenglish.net/vip.

17
00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:14.260
So the first truth I want to share with you is that there's no best way

18
00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:17.680
Or one-size-fits-all approach to learning a language.

19
00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:21.170
Now, unfortunately, there are a lot of snake oil salesmen out there

20
00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:26.900
Whose entire business is based on convincing you that they have the secret. Right?

21
00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:30.410
But the truth is, this secret simply doesn't exist.

22
00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:34.170
What works for you might not work for somebody else.

23
00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:37.030
Some people learn faster by reading and writing,

24
00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:40.020
Others by watching and listening, and others by doing.

25
00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:47.470
So I recommend you take some time to figure out how you like to learn and then create the best plan for you.

26
00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:53.260
Anyone trying to sell you a shortcut or a hack is not someone to be trusted.

27
00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:56.950
You learned your first language with no problems for free.

28
00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:00.690
So why would you pay someone to show you how to do it again?

29
00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:07.100
Now, as I always say, teachers, courses, schools are extremely important.

30
00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:11.430
I actually think they're underrated in terms of the difference they make in our lives.

31
00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:16.220
But don't waste your time chasing some special key that's going to unlock

32
00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:18.950
All the doors for you because it doesn't exist.

33
00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:24.410
Now, the second truth I want to share with you is that you need to understand

34
00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:27.340
The culture that comes with the language you're trying to learn.

35
00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:32.930
And once you understand someone's culture, you can start communicating with them much more effectively.

36
00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:35.660
You can speak their language, as we say.

37
00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:40.220
I'm a firm believer in the idea that you cannot separate language from culture.

38
00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:44.630
A language without culture is just a set of words and rules to be followed.

39
00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:48.850
I consider the difference between American English and British English.

40
00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:52.380
It's the same language, and we understand each other for the most part,

41
00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:57.350
But the way we interact and communicate is completely different. That's culture.

42
00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:00.880
So if you want to reach a high level of fluency in the language

43
00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:06.100
And be able to communicate like a native speaker, you must not ignore the culture.

44
00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:10.620
So get curious, get interested, ask questions.

45
00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:16.900
The U.S. is a gigantic country with all kinds of coexisting people and cultures.

46
00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:19.640
We all have different ways of communicating.

47
00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:24.310
And understanding those differences will help you understand the way we express ourselves.

48
00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:28.420
So the third thing I want to share with you,

49
00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:33.820
The third universal truth of learning a language is that technology changes all the time.

50
00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:38.060
But the language learning process never changes.

51
00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:43.210
There are a bunch of different apps and websites you can use to improve your English.

52
00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:47.320
You know, and every week it seems like I get messages from different companies

53
00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:52.100
Wanting me to promote their unique system or software that will help you become fluent faster.

54
00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:55.890
But the fact of the matter is, I just don't really believe in that type of stuff,

55
00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:57.140
Which is why I never promoted.

56
00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:01.370
I've heard great things about different apps and websites for learning languages,

57
00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:04.640
But no matter how revolutionary the technology is,

58
00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:08.400
You still got to go through the fundamental stages of learning a new skill.

59
00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:12.930
So you can try different websites, apps, and study methods,

60
00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:16.900
But I think it's becoming more and more clear that all those things mean nothing

61
00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:20.460
Unless you're doing the same thing you did when you learned your first language,

62
00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:22.970
Which is talking to real people all the time.

63
00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:27.650
So don't get caught up in the idea that a new technology is going to help you

64
00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:30.300
Learn this language in some revolutionary way.

65
00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:35.700
People were learning languages with no problems long before the internet ever existed.

66
00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:37.560
So what does that mean?

67
00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:42.440
To me, it means that technology has made things much easier for us,

68
00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:44.570
But it hasn't changed the fundamental process.

69
00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:52.610
So the fourth thing, the fourth universal truth I want to share with you is that

70
00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:57.260
Quality will always be so much more important than quantity.

71
00:04:57.850 --> 00:05:04.800
Let me explain. One good language exchange partner is better than 50 mediocre ones.

72
00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:09.340
I managed to learn Portuguese by talking to just two people.

73
00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:14.600
And you might think that's not a lot of people. And it's really not.

74
00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:19.060
But they were high-quality partners. So that's all I needed.

75
00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:23.650
I talked to both of them almost every day about all kinds of things.

76
00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:28.950
Culture, hobbies, money, family, friends, relationships, sex,

77
00:05:28.950 --> 00:05:31.080
Drugs, rock, and roll. All types of stuff.

78
00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:35.720
We were able to sustain such a productive relationship because we both

79
00:05:36.130 --> 00:05:39.990
Or all of us had the same goals and intentions.

80
00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:43.440
Learning a language and making friends with real people.

81
00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:49.960
I think a lot of people overlook the fact that they're talking to a human being when they do a language exchange.

82
00:05:50.890 --> 00:05:55.830
A lot of people simply approach someone and say, "Hey, I'm learning your language. Help me."

83
00:05:56.910 --> 00:05:58.830
Or they start a conversation, but they, you know,

84
00:05:58.830 --> 00:06:02.180
They take absolutely no interest in the person they're talking to.

85
00:06:04.140 --> 00:06:07.550
Each person is a universe to be explored, so to speak.

86
00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.390
Although some are relatively more interesting than others,

87
00:06:11.660 --> 00:06:14.020
You should understand that you will never find a quality partner

88
00:06:14.020 --> 00:06:17.120
If you have no interest in meeting and understanding new people.

89
00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:21.920
You also never find a quality partner if you don't become a quality partner yourself.

90
00:06:22.970 --> 00:06:25.110
I'm definitely going to talk more about this in future episodes,

91
00:06:25.110 --> 00:06:29.200
But for now, just understand that it's not how many people you're talking to.

92
00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:33.890
It's how often you're talking to them and what you're talking about.

93
00:06:36.690 --> 00:06:42.880
The fifth universal truth I want to share with you is that this 'build it and they will come'.

94
00:06:43.180 --> 00:06:48.640
Strategy is a terrible mindset to have, a terrible strategy to employ.

95
00:06:48.640 --> 00:06:54.090
Now, a lot of experienced entrepreneurs and business people are probably familiar with this fallacy.

96
00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:59.320
It comes from the movie Field of Dreams in which this farmer who has fallen on hard times,

97
00:06:59.690 --> 00:07:03.740
Has a vision of a baseball field, and he believes that building this field will be

98
00:07:03.740 --> 00:07:06.900
A great way to host baseball games and thus make money.

99
00:07:08.180 --> 00:07:13.470
He then heard this voice in his head that said, "If you build it, they will come".

100
00:07:13.470 --> 00:07:20.170
And his family and friends thought it was a horrible idea and they begged them not to do it, but he did it anyway.

101
00:07:20.860 --> 00:07:25.160
And slowly but surely, people start coming to his field and his family believes in his vision.

102
00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:27.700
He's making money and things like that. He convinces them.

103
00:07:28.580 --> 00:07:30.880
So the idea here is that you can work on a product,

104
00:07:31.530 --> 00:07:36.210
Make it perfect and eventually release it to the world fully baked, totally polished.

105
00:07:37.140 --> 00:07:42.130
And somehow the world will then find your product, recognize the obvious need for it,

106
00:07:42.450 --> 00:07:45.540
And then beat the proverbial path to your door, begging you to take their money.

107
00:07:47.510 --> 00:07:51.530
That's a romantic story for a movie, but it's far from how things work in real life.

108
00:07:53.050 --> 00:07:56.210
You need to attract people. And simply saying,

109
00:07:56.510 --> 00:07:59.660
"Hey, everyone! I'm learning English" is not attractive at all.

110
00:08:01.530 --> 00:08:05.610
It's the same thing as walking down the street and telling a random group of people that you have a business.

111
00:08:07.280 --> 00:08:08.200
Imagine that for a second.

112
00:08:09.380 --> 00:08:11.550
You just walking down the street, minding your own business

113
00:08:11.550 --> 00:08:15.460
And a stranger comes up to you and says, "Hey, stranger! I've got a business".

114
00:08:17.940 --> 00:08:20.220
I'm sure some people might get curious and ask questions,

115
00:08:20.260 --> 00:08:24.300
But most people would be like, "Okay. So what?".

116
00:08:25.700 --> 00:08:30.180
Most people's natural reaction would be, why should I care? Right?

117
00:08:31.530 --> 00:08:33.730
If people don't have a reason to care, they won't be interested.

118
00:08:34.990 --> 00:08:37.870
So how do you attract people and get them interested? That's the question.

119
00:08:37.870 --> 00:08:45.410
And in my opinion, the answer is by saying and doing what they find attractive or interesting.

120
00:08:46.030 --> 00:08:51.450
Which brings me to the next universal truth. You should never tell people what you want.

121
00:08:52.690 --> 00:08:56.010
You should tell people what you have to offer. And let me explain.

122
00:08:57.750 --> 00:09:02.470
I see people make this mistake every day of the week on language exchange apps,

123
00:09:02.470 --> 00:09:05.910
in my community, in business and relationships, etc.

124
00:09:07.240 --> 00:09:10.740
A lot of people will go on a language exchange app and make a public post that says,

125
00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:15.810
"Hey, I'm learning English and I want someone to practice with. If you're serious, then send me a message".

126
00:09:19.180 --> 00:09:25.380
But the reality of life, business, and language exchanges is that nobody cares what you want.

127
00:09:26.850 --> 00:09:28.960
People care about what you have to offer them.

128
00:09:30.540 --> 00:09:35.140
So what part of that message communicates what you can offer me in a language exchange with you?

129
00:09:36.910 --> 00:09:40.070
I don't care if you're learning English. I don't care if you need a partner.

130
00:09:40.070 --> 00:09:44.190
And frankly, I'm put off by the arrogant tone of your message when you say,

131
00:09:44.610 --> 00:09:47.260
"If you're serious, then send me a message".

132
00:09:48.690 --> 00:09:50.760
So what reason would I have to send you a message?

133
00:09:52.400 --> 00:09:55.460
What part of that message makes me think I would enjoy spending time with you?

134
00:09:56.500 --> 00:09:58.970
And why do I have to come to you when you're the one who needs something?

135
00:10:00.900 --> 00:10:03.480
You've got to understand that you're in the business of solving problems.

136
00:10:04.620 --> 00:10:09.530
In life, in business, and in a language exchange. You're a problem solver or you should be.

137
00:10:10.860 --> 00:10:13.530
During a language exchange, your job is to help someone else

138
00:10:13.560 --> 00:10:16.590
Improve their ability to communicate and their job is the same.

139
00:10:18.010 --> 00:10:21.790
Well, a common issue I see is that a lot of people think it's a 50/50 exchange.

140
00:10:23.070 --> 00:10:27.080
I give you 50% of my effort and you give me 50% of yours. Right?

141
00:10:27.370 --> 00:10:31.330
50 plus 50 equals 100. Right? Wrong.

142
00:10:32.410 --> 00:10:36.590
If I give you 50 and you give me 50, then we both end up with the same fucking 50.

143
00:10:38.310 --> 00:10:42.320
Any healthy relationship, any productive relationship is 100/100.

144
00:10:43.530 --> 00:10:46.470
I give 100% of my effort and you give 100% of yours,

145
00:10:46.800 --> 00:10:48.830
And that way we both end up with 100%.

146
00:10:50.050 --> 00:10:53.940
Both of our problems get solved in this mutually beneficial relationship.

147
00:10:55.010 --> 00:10:56.320
Hopefully, you can understand the metaphor.

148
00:10:57.960 --> 00:10:59.360
So if you can't solve someone's problem,

149
00:11:00.160 --> 00:11:01.620
Then they have no reason to deal with you.

150
00:11:03.290 --> 00:11:06.500
If the restaurant has no food, I'm going to go to another restaurant.

151
00:11:07.230 --> 00:11:09.900
There's nothing interesting to watch on YouTube, I'm going to get on TikTok.

152
00:11:10.520 --> 00:11:13.540
If you can't help me improve my English, I'm going to talk to someone else.

153
00:11:15.550 --> 00:11:17.760
So be a painkiller, not a vitamin.

154
00:11:19.520 --> 00:11:23.420
This is a brilliant concept that I got from a guy named Mike Morrison.

155
00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:25.760
He's the host of the Membership Guys podcast,

156
00:11:25.760 --> 00:11:29.230
And I've been listening to him a lot lately because I want to learn more about how to build

157
00:11:29.230 --> 00:11:30.910
And operate a great membership business.

158
00:11:31.640 --> 00:11:35.290
And his idea is that if you want to successfully run a thriving business,

159
00:11:35.560 --> 00:11:39.070
Whatever your business offers has to be a painkiller and not a vitamin.

160
00:11:39.790 --> 00:11:44.960
Because vitamins are simply nice to have, they're not essential to our daily existence.

161
00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:49.200
Like, we know we should take them, but some of them are nasty.

162
00:11:49.420 --> 00:11:50.940
Some of them are too hard to swallow.

163
00:11:51.210 --> 00:11:53.390
Some of them are expensive and most of all,

164
00:11:53.580 --> 00:11:56.170
It's not something we ever feel that we need.

165
00:11:57.850 --> 00:12:01.020
Painkillers, on the other hand, are something you must have.

166
00:12:02.620 --> 00:12:06.220
When you've got a debilitating migraine or an excruciating toothache,

167
00:12:06.870 --> 00:12:08.940
The only thing on your mind is getting the pain to stop.

168
00:12:10.360 --> 00:12:12.830
In other words, the only thing on your mind is a painkiller.

169
00:12:14.150 --> 00:12:17.190
If the pain is bad enough, you don't even care how much the painkiller costs

170
00:12:17.410 --> 00:12:20.480
You'll do or pay whatever is necessary to stop the pain.

171
00:12:21.920 --> 00:12:24.740
So think about that in the context of looking for a language exchange partner.

172
00:12:26.190 --> 00:12:31.400
You have to understand the true pain points of looking for a quality language exchange partner.

173
00:12:31.760 --> 00:12:34.820
For example, having to deal with people who can't hold the conversation

174
00:12:35.860 --> 00:12:40.580
Or people who have ulterior motives, most of the time sexual ulterior motives. Right?

175
00:12:41.140 --> 00:12:44.500
People who don't have time for you or are always inconsistent with you.

176
00:12:45.420 --> 00:12:48.570
Or having to waste time talking to person after person after person,

177
00:12:48.910 --> 00:12:50.830
But never having a real connection with any of them.

178
00:12:52.060 --> 00:12:55.830
These are the pain points of trying to find a language exchange partner,

179
00:12:55.930 --> 00:12:57.670
Everyone experiences this. Right?

180
00:12:58.810 --> 00:13:01.790
So first, you've got to learn how to solve those problems for your partner.

181
00:13:03.060 --> 00:13:07.400
Then you've got to learn how to communicate the fact that you can solve those problems for your partner.

182
00:13:07.770 --> 00:13:12.370
Because it doesn't matter how great you are if no one knows you're great. Right?

183
00:13:13.760 --> 00:13:18.380
And I can't guarantee that this approach will eliminate all the difficulties of

184
00:13:18.380 --> 00:13:22.690
Finding a language exchange partner, but I speak from experience when I say that

185
00:13:22.690 --> 00:13:26.510
Taking this approach makes the process a lot easier and a lot more enjoyable.

186
00:13:28.290 --> 00:13:31.120
All right. The next universal truth I want to share with you is that

187
00:13:31.120 --> 00:13:34.480
Trust is one of the most important things in any relationship.

188
00:13:36.010 --> 00:13:42.750
People do business with other people that they know, like and/or trust. Right?

189
00:13:42.750 --> 00:13:46.260
People get into relationships with people they know, they like and they trust.

190
00:13:46.530 --> 00:13:49.520
People spend time with people they know, they like and they trust.

191
00:13:50.040 --> 00:13:50.620
You see what I'm saying?

192
00:13:51.810 --> 00:13:54.910
So you have to be able to show somebody that you can be trusted

193
00:13:54.910 --> 00:14:03.740
And what I mean when I say that is don't say or do things that you wouldn't want somebody saying

194
00:14:03.740 --> 00:14:06.400
Or doing to your boyfriend or your girlfriend or your mother

195
00:14:06.460 --> 00:14:10.040
Or your grandmother or something like that. What I'm saying is show respect.

196
00:14:10.780 --> 00:14:13.000
Show somebody that you're serious about this interaction,

197
00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:16.230
About this language exchange, about learning and growing together. All right?

198
00:14:16.570 --> 00:14:23.340
Don't get on these apps asking people for new pictures or their phone number or like... Shit like that.

199
00:14:23.340 --> 00:14:26.750
You know, just why would you do that? Why would you do that?

200
00:14:27.950 --> 00:14:30.960
People on these apps and, you know, I'm generalizing,

201
00:14:30.960 --> 00:14:34.310
But especially girls get on these apps and like all day, every day,

202
00:14:34.310 --> 00:14:38.290
They get all kinds of messages from untrustworthy people who have ulterior motives

203
00:14:38.460 --> 00:14:39.590
And just want to waste their time.

204
00:14:39.880 --> 00:14:41.410
They're not serious about a language exchange.

205
00:14:41.620 --> 00:14:43.500
It happens to guys, too. Trust me, I know.

206
00:14:43.590 --> 00:14:46.600
But I'm generalizing here, just for my example.

207
00:14:47.210 --> 00:14:51.890
So in that case, if you already know one of the pain points is having to deal with

208
00:14:52.130 --> 00:14:55.270
Untrustworthy people with ulterior motives who are just here to waste your time.

209
00:14:55.590 --> 00:14:59.830
You need to show that you are not one of those people, that you can be trustworthy,

210
00:15:00.170 --> 00:15:02.390
That you're here to be serious and show up consistently.

211
00:15:02.740 --> 00:15:04.850
And that you are a good listener. You're open-minded.

212
00:15:05.200 --> 00:15:07.370
You know, you're going to bring your own doubts and questions

213
00:15:07.370 --> 00:15:10.620
And subjects to the conversation. Right? You can be trusted.

214
00:15:11.250 --> 00:15:14.800
You're a serious language exchange partner that just wants to practice language and make friends.

215
00:15:15.070 --> 00:15:18.240
And you're going to give 100% and you expect the same thing in return.

216
00:15:18.960 --> 00:15:20.780
You can count on me. Right?

217
00:15:20.970 --> 00:15:22.770
You have to be able to show that and communicate that.

218
00:15:23.300 --> 00:15:25.970
I know it's easy for me to say that without maybe teaching you

219
00:15:25.970 --> 00:15:29.300
Or giving you clear examples, but hopefully you get the idea.

220
00:15:30.400 --> 00:15:32.950
People do business with, get in relationships with,

221
00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:36.700
And communicate with people that they know, they like and they trust.

222
00:15:37.790 --> 00:15:41.100
Now, you're not going to know everyone. Not everyone is going to like you.

223
00:15:41.590 --> 00:15:44.190
And even if you're a saint, a trustworthy person,

224
00:15:44.190 --> 00:15:46.470
Not everyone is going to trust you. That's fine.

225
00:15:46.470 --> 00:15:49.180
But I'm saying you increase your chances of becoming fluent,

226
00:15:49.720 --> 00:15:51.400
Actually learning the language by finding a partner.

227
00:15:51.400 --> 00:15:53.540
And you increase your chances of finding a partner

228
00:15:54.060 --> 00:15:58.330
By showing your partner that you are quality partner, a trustworthy partner,

229
00:15:58.520 --> 00:16:00.530
A dedicated partner. You see what I'm saying?

230
00:16:01.550 --> 00:16:02.610
So, just something to think about.

231
00:16:03.930 --> 00:16:08.210
Now, the last universal truth I want to share with you in this episode is that

232
00:16:08.640 --> 00:16:11.590
A satisfied partner is a long-term partner.

233
00:16:11.610 --> 00:16:14.360
And what I mean when I say that is,

234
00:16:15.110 --> 00:16:18.710
If you're giving your partner everything they need in terms of support, you know,

235
00:16:18.710 --> 00:16:22.090
You're making conversation with them, you're correcting their mistakes,

236
00:16:22.530 --> 00:16:26.130
Answering all their questions, you're consistently talking to them during the week

237
00:16:26.130 --> 00:16:29.770
And stuff like that. You're being a great partner, basically.

238
00:16:31.270 --> 00:16:34.040
Your partner is going to be satisfied more than likely, right?

239
00:16:34.040 --> 00:16:37.570
If you're helping them in every way you can and you're really helping them improve

240
00:16:37.860 --> 00:16:40.240
And understand things better, they're going to be satisfied.

241
00:16:40.750 --> 00:16:45.070
And when they are satisfied, they want to talk to you more. They want to keep talking to you.

242
00:16:45.920 --> 00:16:47.880
Because that's another problem that we all face. Right?

243
00:16:47.880 --> 00:16:50.470
We might find somebody, start a conversation with them,

244
00:16:50.850 --> 00:16:53.500
And even if we talk for a few days or a few weeks,

245
00:16:53.790 --> 00:16:56.980
A lot of times you just lose touch with people for whatever reason.

246
00:16:57.520 --> 00:17:01.360
You weren't helping them the way that they needed or they weren't helping you the way that you needed.

247
00:17:01.360 --> 00:17:07.620
But the point is, a lot of times people ghost you or just disappear, stop responding to your messages

248
00:17:07.620 --> 00:17:11.140
Or phone calls because something about the interaction was not satisfying them.

249
00:17:11.720 --> 00:17:14.070
They weren't getting what they wanted or needed from that interaction.

250
00:17:14.070 --> 00:17:17.680
So if you can learn what your partner truly needs,

251
00:17:17.950 --> 00:17:21.580
How to satisfy those needs in the context of a language exchange,

252
00:17:22.170 --> 00:17:25.030
Then I think you have a much higher chance of keeping that partner,

253
00:17:25.450 --> 00:17:28.920
Which means you have a higher chance of consistently practicing your speaking

254
00:17:28.920 --> 00:17:34.160
And listening skills, which means you have a higher chance of becoming an advanced speaker or even a fluent speaker.

255
00:17:34.450 --> 00:17:40.100
So a satisfied partner is a long-term partner because this is a long-term game.

256
00:17:40.740 --> 00:17:45.110
We're not talking about 30 days to fluency or 90 days to fluency or something like that.

257
00:17:45.860 --> 00:17:50.710
Like, learning a language is a process that never ends. It never ends.

258
00:17:51.730 --> 00:17:54.920
Even my first language, I learn stuff about my first language all the time.

259
00:17:56.210 --> 00:17:58.890
Foreigners teach me stuff about my first language sometimes,

260
00:17:59.120 --> 00:18:01.190
Or just make me think about things I never considered.

261
00:18:01.190 --> 00:18:04.530
You're always learning when it comes to language. It never stops.

262
00:18:04.870 --> 00:18:08.560
So if you can't maintain a relationship with, you know,

263
00:18:08.560 --> 00:18:12.440
Multiple or even just one partner for more than a year, two years...

264
00:18:12.700 --> 00:18:16.440
I'm not saying that it's always going to be your fault if that's the case or you're doing something wrong.

265
00:18:16.850 --> 00:18:19.060
I'm just saying if you can't do that for whatever reason,

266
00:18:20.960 --> 00:18:23.840
You're just making it harder for yourself because now you have to go find another partner

267
00:18:23.840 --> 00:18:27.350
And start all over again. And we know how hard it is. Right?

268
00:18:27.460 --> 00:18:32.970
So I'm sure you get the idea. A happy partner is a satisfied partner.

269
00:18:33.740 --> 00:18:37.880
So, don't just focus on finding a great partner,

270
00:18:37.880 --> 00:18:41.000
But be a great partner that attracts great partners.

271
00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:42.920
I like to think about it that way. You know?

272
00:18:43.740 --> 00:18:44.600
I'd love to know what you think.

273
00:18:45.390 --> 00:18:48.130
So let me just recap really quickly these,

274
00:18:48.170 --> 00:18:51.350
I think, 8 universal truths about learning a language.

275
00:18:51.460 --> 00:18:57.760
Number one, there is no best way or one-size-fits-all way or only way to learn a language.

276
00:18:58.180 --> 00:19:00.890
What works for me, might not work for you. Right?

277
00:19:01.320 --> 00:19:05.960
Number two, you need to understand the culture that comes with the language you are trying to learn.

278
00:19:06.230 --> 00:19:07.930
You cannot separate language from culture,

279
00:19:08.210 --> 00:19:10.830
Especially when you want to learn how to communicate like a native

280
00:19:11.060 --> 00:19:14.680
Or truly understand what natives mean when they speak. Okay?

281
00:19:15.320 --> 00:19:20.230
Number three, technology changes all the time, but the language learning process does not.

282
00:19:21.030 --> 00:19:24.830
So this new revolutionary app or website or whatever is cool,

283
00:19:24.830 --> 00:19:28.630
It might make it easier for you. But understand, fundamentals are fundamentals.

284
00:19:29.010 --> 00:19:31.300
And at the end of the day, you're going to have to do some work.

285
00:19:31.930 --> 00:19:36.870
There's no new tech or app that's just going to do this shit for you.

286
00:19:37.310 --> 00:19:37.870
You see what I'm saying?

287
00:19:38.840 --> 00:19:41.270
Number four, quality over quantity.

288
00:19:41.930 --> 00:19:44.480
One good partner is better than 50 mediocre ones.

289
00:19:44.720 --> 00:19:50.020
So learn how to attract, keep and also be a quality language exchange partner.

290
00:19:51.600 --> 00:19:56.040
Number five, build it and they will come is a terrible mindset and a terrible strategy.

291
00:19:56.320 --> 00:20:00.240
Simply saying, "Hey, I'm learning English" is not interesting or attractive to anyone,

292
00:20:00.560 --> 00:20:02.090
At least in my experience. Okay?

293
00:20:02.420 --> 00:20:05.860
Which takes me to the next point, which is don't tell people what you want,

294
00:20:06.530 --> 00:20:08.900
Tell people what you have to offer. Okay?

295
00:20:09.670 --> 00:20:13.320
I can't guarantee results, but I'm almost positive you will see better results

296
00:20:13.600 --> 00:20:17.350
If you focus on what you have to offer and not just what you want from other people. All right?

297
00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:21.770
Next, is what? Damn, this is a lot right here.

298
00:20:22.660 --> 00:20:24.820
Next, trust is like currency.

299
00:20:25.100 --> 00:20:27.770
It's one of the most valuable things in any relationship.

300
00:20:28.080 --> 00:20:29.440
If somebody feels they can't trust you,

301
00:20:31.120 --> 00:20:33.510
You're probably not going to be interacting with that person for very long

302
00:20:33.880 --> 00:20:35.930
Or it's not going to be a very positive interaction.

303
00:20:35.930 --> 00:20:39.730
So you need to be a person that can be trusted.

304
00:20:39.730 --> 00:20:43.460
You need to be trustworthy and also genuinely communicate that

305
00:20:43.460 --> 00:20:45.760
Or show that through your actions, not just your words.

306
00:20:45.930 --> 00:20:46.790
You see what I'm saying?

307
00:20:46.910 --> 00:20:50.020
And finally, a satisfied partner is a long-term partner.

308
00:20:50.740 --> 00:20:55.650
Learning a language is like a marathon. Okay? It's a long-term process.

309
00:20:55.650 --> 00:21:00.020
Got to stay dedicated for long periods of time to really get to a high level

310
00:21:00.020 --> 00:21:01.890
And then stay there. You see what I'm saying?

311
00:21:01.890 --> 00:21:03.790
So by being a great partner,

312
00:21:04.090 --> 00:21:06.180
Making sure that your partner gets everything that they need,

313
00:21:06.420 --> 00:21:08.310
You increase the chances that they do the same for you

314
00:21:08.310 --> 00:21:12.700
And you guys are helping each other effortlessly for years and years to come.

315
00:21:12.700 --> 00:21:15.720
And then it's not even about just language, you just have this great friend.

316
00:21:16.090 --> 00:21:18.250
Because that's what it's all about, man. You know what I'm saying?

317
00:21:18.750 --> 00:21:21.950
So we could go into much more depth about each of these truths,

318
00:21:21.950 --> 00:21:25.310
But hopefully, this episode has given you a few things to think about.

319
00:21:25.600 --> 00:21:28.410
And hopefully, you'll be able to apply some of this information

320
00:21:28.410 --> 00:21:31.980
And start to see better results in your process. But that's it for now.

321
00:21:31.980 --> 00:21:35.740
So if you're still with me at this point, I want to thank you for your time and your attention.

322
00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:38.570
I hope you enjoyed the episode. And this is Life in English.

323
00:21:38.570 --> 00:21:40.230
I'm your host, Tony Kaizen.

324
00:21:40.230 --> 00:21:43.390
And I will talk to you soon. Peace!

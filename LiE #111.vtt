00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:00.890
What's up, everybody.

00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:03.259
You are listening to another episode of life in English.

00:00:03.289 --> 00:00:04.609
I'm your host, Tony.

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:09.590
And in this episode, we are talking about confidence.

00:00:16.046 --> 00:00:16.526
Alright.

00:00:17.226 --> 00:00:19.546
Andrés from España says,

00:00:19.896 --> 00:00:23.191
"Bro, I've moved abroad to study medicine in English.

00:00:23.401 --> 00:00:26.341
I'm originally from Spain and people laugh at my English.

00:00:26.701 --> 00:00:28.561
Any advice for being more confident?"

00:00:30.001 --> 00:00:34.111
This is a very important topic, and I know a lot of people have experienced this same situation.

00:00:34.591 --> 00:00:37.741
I'm going to do my best to answer this question, not by telling you what to do,

00:00:37.981 --> 00:00:41.341
but by challenging you to shift or change your mindset.

00:00:41.971 --> 00:00:47.101
Let me start by saying, I can appreciate the fact that other people laughing at your English is something that makes you feel bad.

00:00:47.551 --> 00:00:51.451
I can appreciate the fact that you're struggling with your confidence and your self-esteem.

00:00:51.931 --> 00:00:55.831
So I want to make it clear that when I'm about to say is not meant to be taken as an attack.

00:00:56.461 --> 00:00:58.831
What I'm about to say is not a critique of who you are.

00:00:59.101 --> 00:01:04.211
I also don't want you to think I can't empathize with you and that I've never been in your position because I have...

00:01:04.721 --> 00:01:05.381
many times.

00:01:06.301 --> 00:01:09.691
Now that that's clear, let me start by detailing the situation.

00:01:09.721 --> 00:01:14.791
You've made a decision to learn a new skill, a skill that most people,

00:01:15.091 --> 00:01:18.871
especially English speakers, will never even attempt to learn in their lifetimes.

00:01:19.741 --> 00:01:22.771
You decided to live in another country and study medicine.

00:01:23.641 --> 00:01:28.081
The problem is not only do you have the challenge of learning about the complexities of modern medicine,

00:01:28.501 --> 00:01:31.281
but you have to learn about it in a language that's foreign to you.

00:01:32.021 --> 00:01:35.371
Not only do you have the challenge of medicine and language to worry about,

00:01:35.491 --> 00:01:40.621
but whenever you try to communicate with your colleagues in this foreign language, they laugh at you because of the way you speak.

00:01:41.671 --> 00:01:46.111
You're a Spanish man in a foreign land and the people of that land don't accept you.

00:01:47.221 --> 00:01:53.461
I imagine this type of thing affects all aspects of your self-confidence because language is at the base of everything we do.

00:01:54.091 --> 00:01:57.491
And every time you try to use the language, people make you feel stupid for it.

00:01:58.321 --> 00:02:03.976
So you want to know how to gain the confidence you need to be successful in medical school and in your career thereafter.

00:02:04.996 --> 00:02:08.536
Well, first we have to talk about what confidence actually is.

00:02:10.406 --> 00:02:17.696
The dictionary defines confidence as a feeling or consciousness of one's powers or of reliance on one's circumstances.

00:02:18.356 --> 00:02:22.986
Faith or belief that one will act in a right, proper, or effective way.

00:02:23.826 --> 00:02:26.326
The quality or state of being certain.

00:02:27.046 --> 00:02:32.926
A feeling of self-assurance arising from one's appreciation of one's own abilities or qualities.

00:02:33.946 --> 00:02:39.526
Confidence is a state of being clearheaded either that a hypothesis or prediction is correct,

00:02:39.796 --> 00:02:42.586
or that a chosen course of action is the best or most effective.

00:02:43.366 --> 00:02:47.366
Confidence comes from a Latin word 'fidere', which means to trust.

00:02:47.926 --> 00:02:52.126
Therefore having self-confidence is having trust in oneself.

00:02:53.626 --> 00:02:56.806
If I understood your message correctly, Andrés, this is what you're after.

00:02:57.406 --> 00:02:58.306
This is what you want.

00:02:58.756 --> 00:03:00.886
And your question is, "How do I get it?"

00:03:01.966 --> 00:03:05.056
Well, if we take a closer look at these definitions, we can find the answer.

00:03:05.806 --> 00:03:07.936
Having confidence is having trust in oneself,

00:03:08.176 --> 00:03:13.801
a feeling of self-assurance arising from one's appreciation of one's own abilities and qualities,

00:03:14.251 --> 00:03:18.361
faith or belief that one will act in a right proper or effective way.

00:03:19.531 --> 00:03:20.641
You have to trust yourself.

00:03:21.601 --> 00:03:24.271
You have to know and appreciate your own abilities and qualities.

00:03:24.451 --> 00:03:26.521
You must have faith in yourself.

00:03:27.661 --> 00:03:30.991
How can you do these things if you don't truly know yourself?

00:03:32.341 --> 00:03:34.411
You can't, it's impossible.

00:03:35.331 --> 00:03:41.361
Now, you can have false confidence also known as arrogance, but that won't get you very far in my opinion.

00:03:42.421 --> 00:03:44.191
So you must get to know yourself.

00:03:45.301 --> 00:03:47.971
Self-confidence comes from self knowledge.

00:03:49.141 --> 00:03:50.311
You have to know what you look like.

00:03:50.941 --> 00:03:52.441
What are your physical characteristics?

00:03:53.161 --> 00:03:54.241
You have to know how you sound.

00:03:55.051 --> 00:03:56.281
What's your communication style?

00:03:56.911 --> 00:03:57.751
Are you aggressive?

00:03:57.991 --> 00:03:58.561
Timid?

00:03:58.741 --> 00:03:59.671
Soft-spoken?

00:03:59.971 --> 00:04:00.541
Eloquent?

00:04:00.781 --> 00:04:01.351
Direct?

00:04:02.341 --> 00:04:03.661
You have to know what you're capable of.

00:04:04.561 --> 00:04:05.761
Can you read and right well?

00:04:06.361 --> 00:04:07.381
Do you learn fast?

00:04:07.441 --> 00:04:08.521
Are you good with numbers?

00:04:08.791 --> 00:04:09.731
Are you good with people?

00:04:10.241 --> 00:04:11.816
Are you open-minded or close-minded?

00:04:12.286 --> 00:04:13.426
Is your body in good shape?

00:04:13.966 --> 00:04:15.526
Can you stay committed to your goals?

00:04:15.736 --> 00:04:17.146
Are you easily influenced?

00:04:17.686 --> 00:04:18.886
Are you addicted to anything?

00:04:19.636 --> 00:04:20.356
What interests you?

00:04:21.166 --> 00:04:22.126
Why does it interest you?

00:04:23.626 --> 00:04:26.056
You also have to know what you're not capable of.

00:04:26.356 --> 00:04:30.016
This is just as, if not more important than knowing what you're capable of.

00:04:31.036 --> 00:04:31.966
Can you get taller?

00:04:32.596 --> 00:04:33.616
Can you run faster?

00:04:34.066 --> 00:04:35.296
Can you be someone else?

00:04:35.896 --> 00:04:37.156
Do you know how to be a leader?

00:04:37.846 --> 00:04:39.006
Do you know how to be a follower?

00:04:39.856 --> 00:04:40.471
Are you funny?

00:04:41.041 --> 00:04:42.031
Are you good with kids?

00:04:42.271 --> 00:04:43.081
Are you genuine?

00:04:44.431 --> 00:04:46.831
Now at this point you might be thinking, "Okay, that's cool.

00:04:47.101 --> 00:04:48.661
But how do I figure all of this out?"

00:04:49.711 --> 00:04:52.741
Well, the answer to that question is pay attention.

00:04:53.821 --> 00:04:54.751
Self-awareness.

00:04:55.981 --> 00:04:58.771
Self knowledge comes from self awareness.

00:04:58.921 --> 00:05:02.941
Become aware of yourself, pay attention to yourself.

00:05:03.751 --> 00:05:04.951
Put your fucking phone down.

00:05:05.941 --> 00:05:09.151
Turn off your computer and spend some time with yourself.

00:05:10.321 --> 00:05:15.421
Take note of your thoughts, your habits, the things you believe, your mood and your energy.

00:05:16.261 --> 00:05:19.951
Take note of the things that affect your thoughts, your mood, and your energy.

00:05:20.551 --> 00:05:24.871
Start a podcast, or keep a journal that documents the things you're thinking and feeling.

00:05:25.651 --> 00:05:26.791
Process these things.

00:05:27.961 --> 00:05:32.711
Take time to reflect on past experiences and what you can learn about yourself from those experiences.

00:05:33.361 --> 00:05:38.566
'Cause after all the only reason you can remember the past is so you can learn from it and do better in the future.

00:05:39.766 --> 00:05:43.456
So if you're truly paying attention and you're honest with yourself,

00:05:44.656 --> 00:05:46.846
I'm sure you'll start to see patterns in your behavior,

00:05:47.086 --> 00:05:50.926
your thought process and your relationships, your work, et cetera.

00:05:52.376 --> 00:05:57.076
You can get a sense of the type of person you really are and what it is that makes you, who you are.

00:05:58.126 --> 00:06:00.506
In other words, you will gain self-knowledge.

00:06:00.871 --> 00:06:04.681
And like I said before, self knowledge leads to self confidence.

00:06:05.851 --> 00:06:10.021
Self-confidence isn't the belief that you can be or do anything in this life.

00:06:10.981 --> 00:06:13.621
Self-confidence is knowing a hundred percent who you are,

00:06:13.951 --> 00:06:18.121
what you're capable of, what you're not capable of and accepting it.

00:06:19.291 --> 00:06:20.131
You have to own it.

00:06:22.161 --> 00:06:23.961
This is where a lot of us start to have problems.

00:06:24.591 --> 00:06:26.811
We realize that we have a dark side.

00:06:27.831 --> 00:06:28.491
We aren't perfect.

00:06:29.311 --> 00:06:30.961
We are the people we would like to be.

00:06:31.591 --> 00:06:36.871
Not only that, but other people are doing the things we want to do, or they have the qualities we want to possess.

00:06:37.501 --> 00:06:42.361
Not only that, but people judge us and make fun of us because of who we are or who we are not.

00:06:43.381 --> 00:06:48.601
We feel embarrassed and ashamed of the people we discover when we become aware of ourselves.

00:06:50.071 --> 00:06:53.701
Now, many of us are well aware of our imperfections and shortcomings,

00:06:53.821 --> 00:06:57.781
but we just have a hard time accepting them, which is why we lack confidence.

00:06:58.801 --> 00:07:02.491
We're so attached to this idea of who we believe we should be

00:07:03.991 --> 00:07:08.461
instead of accepting who we are and working diligently to become who we want to be.

00:07:09.691 --> 00:07:13.891
At the end of the day, self-confidence is little more than self acceptance.

00:07:14.761 --> 00:07:19.681
When you've accepted the fact that your English is terrible, things become much more simple.

00:07:20.821 --> 00:07:21.881
You only have two options.

00:07:22.926 --> 00:07:29.376
Let your English be terrible forever (nothing wrong with that) or work hard to improve your English.

00:07:30.516 --> 00:07:32.826
Those are your only two logical options.

00:07:33.666 --> 00:07:36.216
Crying and complaining about it doesn't make sense.

00:07:36.846 --> 00:07:40.206
Expecting someone else to solve the problem for you doesn't make sense.

00:07:40.776 --> 00:07:45.126
Letting other people make you feel bad for something you've already accepted about yourself

00:07:45.366 --> 00:07:48.156
also makes absolutely no fucking sense.

00:07:49.616 --> 00:07:57.921
So remember, self-awareness leads to self-knowledge, self-knowledge leads to self-confidence.

00:08:00.501 --> 00:08:03.711
So now that I've talked about, you know, what true confidence is,

00:08:04.641 --> 00:08:10.971
let me challenge you to shift your mindset so you can see that people laughing at you or talking shit about you is not a problem.

00:08:11.961 --> 00:08:14.001
It never has been, and it never will be.

00:08:15.531 --> 00:08:21.401
What you need to understand, is that what people say about you says absolutely nothing about you.

00:08:22.961 --> 00:08:27.401
What people say to you says absolutely nothing about you.

00:08:28.541 --> 00:08:32.891
What people do to you says absolutely nothing about you.

00:08:34.271 --> 00:08:37.121
People's words and actions are only reflections of themselves.

00:08:38.438 --> 00:08:42.038
So if you find somebody's laughing at you because of the way you speak English,

00:08:42.038 --> 00:08:46.538
or because of the way you do a certain task, or just because of who you are,

00:08:47.258 --> 00:08:50.448
you have to stop and ask yourself, what does that mean, exactly?

00:08:51.783 --> 00:08:52.983
Does that define who I am.

00:08:52.983 --> 00:08:54.213
Does that change who I am?

00:08:54.543 --> 00:08:57.093
Does that say or mean anything about me in particular?

00:08:57.153 --> 00:08:57.933
No, of course not.

00:08:59.043 --> 00:08:59.583
Of course not.

00:08:59.763 --> 00:09:04.563
If you're trying to express yourself in a foreign language that's not your own, and you're having a difficult time...

00:09:04.763 --> 00:09:09.333
you have a strong accent or whatever it is, and somebody decides to point their finger at you and start laughing...

00:09:10.023 --> 00:09:14.043
the only thing that says about anybody is that they are the piece of shit.

00:09:14.073 --> 00:09:15.123
They are the asshole.

00:09:15.603 --> 00:09:16.713
It doesn't say anything about you.

00:09:17.493 --> 00:09:19.103
You haven't done anything to anybody.

00:09:20.063 --> 00:09:20.668
You see what I'm saying?

00:09:21.598 --> 00:09:25.738
If anything, it just says that that person simply does not understand.

00:09:25.738 --> 00:09:28.468
They cannot empathize with the position that you are in.

00:09:28.468 --> 00:09:30.118
They've never been in your position.

00:09:30.268 --> 00:09:37.408
They never had to leave their country, go across the world to study medicine in a foreign language by themselves.

00:09:38.048 --> 00:09:38.298
Right?

00:09:38.298 --> 00:09:43.458
Be the only person in the classroom, most likely, that's from their country, that speaks their language,

00:09:44.693 --> 00:09:46.973
and step outside their comfort zone to express themselves.

00:09:46.973 --> 00:09:48.293
They've never been in that position.

00:09:48.503 --> 00:09:49.523
They cannot empathize.

00:09:50.573 --> 00:09:53.753
So when they look at you, there's there's no...

00:09:54.563 --> 00:09:55.283
how can I say...

00:09:56.273 --> 00:09:57.113
there's no empathy.

00:09:58.013 --> 00:10:00.173
They don't care about what you're going through, what your position is.

00:10:00.173 --> 00:10:01.283
They just don't understand.

00:10:01.283 --> 00:10:02.333
They don't care to understand.

00:10:02.573 --> 00:10:05.153
It's easier to feel superior, easier to feel like,

00:10:05.333 --> 00:10:05.903
"Oh, I'm cool.

00:10:05.903 --> 00:10:06.473
I'm the shit.

00:10:06.473 --> 00:10:07.643
Look at this fucking idiot.

00:10:08.363 --> 00:10:10.493
Trying to speak, learn how to speak English bro.

00:10:11.353 --> 00:10:11.523
Right?"

00:10:11.523 --> 00:10:18.363
It's so much easier to do that be cocky and arrogant and an asshole because everybody else is like me.

00:10:18.363 --> 00:10:19.243
We all speak English.

00:10:19.293 --> 00:10:20.403
We're all in the same group.

00:10:20.823 --> 00:10:22.863
You know, I feel confident in numbers.

00:10:22.863 --> 00:10:28.353
I feel confident in my comfort zone, my country, my university, my language, my friends and classmates.

00:10:28.923 --> 00:10:30.783
So it's easy to be an asshole.

00:10:32.113 --> 00:10:36.523
But those types of people who most likely have never been across the world to study something complex

00:10:36.523 --> 00:10:44.588
like medicine in a foreign language where they're the only English speaker in the city, let alone the university or the classroom.

00:10:45.368 --> 00:10:50.018
They've never had to try and express themselves in Spanish or Vietnamese or Swahili or something like that.

00:10:51.248 --> 00:10:51.578
Right.

00:10:52.628 --> 00:10:54.998
So it's easy for them to be arrogant in that situation.

00:10:55.208 --> 00:10:59.828
Or even worse, maybe they have been in a situation where they are the outsider, let's say.

00:11:00.698 --> 00:11:05.418
And they are the ones that are embarrassed and laughed at and made fun of for being the foreigner,

00:11:05.438 --> 00:11:08.618
for being the one that can't speak the language perfectly or whatever it is.

00:11:08.948 --> 00:11:12.068
And their ego was so damaged, it was so hurt.

00:11:12.158 --> 00:11:15.188
They felt so bad about themselves that after that moment,

00:11:15.578 --> 00:11:20.708
they made it their life's mission to make everybody else feel that way so that they can feel better about themselves.

00:11:21.818 --> 00:11:25.928
Either way, either way, it says nothing about you.

00:11:27.678 --> 00:11:28.028
Nothing.

00:11:28.133 --> 00:11:29.243
So you have to get to a point...

00:11:29.243 --> 00:11:34.133
what I'm trying to say is you have to get to a point where you know yourself so well

00:11:34.823 --> 00:11:41.903
inside and out, the good, the bad, the ugly, the light and the dark that nobody can say shit to you.

00:11:41.933 --> 00:11:44.813
Nobody can tell you something about yourself that you don't already know.

00:11:46.433 --> 00:11:51.233
Whether it's good or bad if somebody is telling you something about yourself that you already know, why would it affect you?

00:11:53.503 --> 00:11:54.703
Why would it have any effect on you?

00:11:54.703 --> 00:11:55.393
You already know.

00:11:56.813 --> 00:11:57.443
You see what I'm saying?

00:11:58.133 --> 00:11:59.453
So that's the point you got to get to.

00:11:59.813 --> 00:12:05.663
You have to go inside yourself and get to know your strengths, your weaknesses,

00:12:05.663 --> 00:12:09.263
your shortcomings, you know, your gifts, all of your qualities.

00:12:09.683 --> 00:12:10.403
You see what I'm saying?

00:12:10.463 --> 00:12:14.813
You have to be very, very, very, very honest with yourself.

00:12:16.073 --> 00:12:21.253
Have that conversation with yourself sometimes daily, you know, and remind yourself of who you actually are.

00:12:21.883 --> 00:12:28.583
And you might be thinking, "Yeah, easy for you to say, Tony, you're extroverted and you're confident, and this, this and that,

00:12:28.583 --> 00:12:31.343
you speak well and you speak three languages and blah, blah, blah."

00:12:31.343 --> 00:12:37.433
But what you don't know is where I come from or who I was a year ago or five years ago,

00:12:37.613 --> 00:12:40.913
or 10 years ago, and how I've grown and evolved over time.

00:12:40.943 --> 00:12:42.353
That's the part that you haven't seen.

00:12:42.653 --> 00:12:44.273
You will never see and you will never know.

00:12:44.903 --> 00:12:47.243
So I'm not speaking like, oh, it's so easy.

00:12:47.243 --> 00:12:49.073
It's so, you know, just do it.

00:12:50.048 --> 00:12:50.948
Even though I kind of am.

00:12:50.948 --> 00:12:52.478
'Cause it's not easy, but it's simple.

00:12:52.898 --> 00:12:53.448
But what you don't...

00:12:53.468 --> 00:13:01.478
What I'm trying to say is that you will never understand the fact that the reason I say this was such confidence is because I'd done that work.

00:13:01.538 --> 00:13:04.028
I've gone to, let's say, the dark side.

00:13:04.418 --> 00:13:10.358
The place that most people try to avoid, because it's an uncomfortable feeling to have to get to know yourself,

00:13:11.918 --> 00:13:14.818
or it's an uncomfortable feeling to have to get to know all of yourself,

00:13:15.308 --> 00:13:18.818
when there's huge parts of yourself that you don't necessarily like,

00:13:19.058 --> 00:13:22.928
or that you're embarrassed about as you're ashamed of that you wish were different...

00:13:23.498 --> 00:13:27.398
that you know you can't change, but every day you sit and wish you could change it.

00:13:28.298 --> 00:13:34.118
It's an uncomfortable process to go through on a daily or weekly or monthly basis, you know?

00:13:34.388 --> 00:13:38.018
But you have to go through it and I've been through it, you know, I'm going through it.

00:13:38.018 --> 00:13:48.363
So the reason that there's literally nothing, you can say to me that's going to affect me emotionally or mentally

00:13:48.363 --> 00:13:56.163
is because you could never in a million years think of something so fucked up to say to me that I haven't already said to myself.

00:13:57.093 --> 00:14:01.473
The little motherfucker in the back of my head, that's always, always talking shit.

00:14:01.623 --> 00:14:03.033
I was trying to bring me down.

00:14:03.573 --> 00:14:05.793
You know, that little bitch inside.

00:14:07.023 --> 00:14:08.193
There's nothing you could say.

00:14:08.943 --> 00:14:12.183
Nothing you could say that's worse than what I hear on a daily basis.

00:14:12.183 --> 00:14:12.853
There's nothing.

00:14:14.333 --> 00:14:14.703
Nothing.

00:14:15.473 --> 00:14:19.198
So why would I let something that you say affect me?

00:14:20.548 --> 00:14:21.388
"Oh, you're ugly.

00:14:22.318 --> 00:14:23.098
You're not funny.

00:14:23.158 --> 00:14:23.758
You're short.

00:14:24.218 --> 00:14:25.708
Your English is trash."

00:14:25.978 --> 00:14:26.818
Whatever it is.

00:14:28.348 --> 00:14:28.828
Okay.

00:14:30.688 --> 00:14:31.678
I know that, right?

00:14:31.768 --> 00:14:32.808
"Your English is terrible.

00:14:32.808 --> 00:14:34.358
HA HA HA learn English!"

00:14:35.818 --> 00:14:36.328
Okay.

00:14:37.048 --> 00:14:37.468
I know that.

00:14:38.198 --> 00:14:39.698
Yeah, I'm trying to improve.

00:14:39.788 --> 00:14:44.348
So if you don't have something positive to add, if you're not going to help me, fuck off.

00:14:45.518 --> 00:14:46.148
You see what I'm saying?

00:14:46.718 --> 00:14:48.068
That's the mentality you have to have.

00:14:48.068 --> 00:14:51.308
Not to be an arrogant asshole or nothing like that, but just understand...

00:14:52.058 --> 00:14:53.638
people talking shit, who cares bro?

00:14:53.768 --> 00:14:57.788
If you know yourself and you know who you are, if you know what you're not capable of,

00:14:57.788 --> 00:14:59.268
if you know what you need to work on...

00:15:00.668 --> 00:15:03.428
What does it matter of somebody else just tells you that or reminds you?

00:15:03.788 --> 00:15:08.888
Regardless of how they say it, even if they're mean or rude or arrogant about it, who gives a shit?

00:15:09.898 --> 00:15:10.188
Who cares?

00:15:10.188 --> 00:15:12.818
It does not say anything about you.

00:15:12.818 --> 00:15:13.778
It doesn't define you.

00:15:14.648 --> 00:15:15.308
You feel what I'm saying?

00:15:15.968 --> 00:15:16.898
It doesn't mean anything.

00:15:16.898 --> 00:15:20.708
And that goes for the negative and the positive, because it goes both ways.

00:15:21.188 --> 00:15:23.108
It's all about your ego and it goes both ways.

00:15:23.108 --> 00:15:26.933
So if somebody saying something negative should have no effect on you,

00:15:27.113 --> 00:15:28.973
it's the same thing with somebody giving you compliments,

00:15:28.973 --> 00:15:32.333
telling you how beautiful you are, how smart you are, how talented you are.

00:15:32.573 --> 00:15:35.663
You can't let that have a mental or positive effect on you,

00:15:35.903 --> 00:15:38.603
and then say all the negative stuff isn't going to have an effect on me.

00:15:39.743 --> 00:15:41.213
It goes both ways in my opinion.

00:15:41.723 --> 00:15:48.173
So don't let somebody pump up your ego or make your head super big by telling you all this positive shit either.

00:15:48.503 --> 00:15:50.713
You need to stay balanced and grounded and level.

00:15:51.153 --> 00:15:52.433
Positive or negative.

00:15:52.883 --> 00:15:58.613
Neither one of these things should have so much of an effect on you that it changes the way you feel or think about yourself.

00:15:59.723 --> 00:16:02.243
Now, when I say that, I don't mean that you shouldn't listen to people

00:16:02.813 --> 00:16:06.563
because everybody can tell you something that you don't know, including something about yourself.

00:16:06.803 --> 00:16:09.203
Because no matter how well you think you know yourself,

00:16:09.593 --> 00:16:13.433
everybody else in your life knows a different version of you that you can't see.

00:16:14.303 --> 00:16:16.223
Because you can't see yourself through somebody else's eyes.

00:16:16.343 --> 00:16:20.813
So maybe somebody, even your enemy, somebody you hate or despise or don't respect,

00:16:21.083 --> 00:16:23.933
they can also tell you something about yourself that you need to know.

00:16:25.673 --> 00:16:27.863
So even if you think, you know yourself, a hundred percent,

00:16:28.733 --> 00:16:31.763
your enemy could tell you even more and that's okay.

00:16:31.943 --> 00:16:37.673
You need to take that information objectively and you process it and you determine what it means.

00:16:37.853 --> 00:16:39.423
You determine whether or not it's true.

00:16:39.443 --> 00:16:40.988
That's what I'm trying to say,

00:16:41.198 --> 00:16:44.648
is you don't let somebody else's words or actions or opinions define you.

00:16:45.488 --> 00:16:48.938
So you can take them in and process them but be objective about it.

00:16:50.078 --> 00:16:54.428
Don't let somebody come in and tell you something about yourself that makes you feel worse about yourself.

00:16:54.458 --> 00:16:55.478
That should never happen.

00:16:56.978 --> 00:16:57.968
That should never happen.

00:16:58.778 --> 00:17:03.158
So that's what I mean, is you have to get to a point where you can become self aware enough,

00:17:03.668 --> 00:17:09.233
pay enough attention to yourself that you start to know yourself inside and out.

00:17:09.533 --> 00:17:13.853
Because once you get to that point, once you know who you are, you can trust yourself.

00:17:14.693 --> 00:17:17.483
You can trust yourself and know I'm capable of this.

00:17:17.753 --> 00:17:18.833
I'm not capable of that.

00:17:19.103 --> 00:17:19.973
I could learn this.

00:17:20.243 --> 00:17:21.953
I could never learn that I could do this.

00:17:21.953 --> 00:17:22.793
I can never do that.

00:17:23.303 --> 00:17:23.603
Right?

00:17:24.893 --> 00:17:26.303
I'd be happy in this situation.

00:17:26.303 --> 00:17:27.503
I wouldn't be happy in that one.

00:17:27.713 --> 00:17:29.423
These are the types of people I want in my life.

00:17:29.603 --> 00:17:30.873
These are the type of people I don't.

00:17:31.553 --> 00:17:37.103
By being self-aware, learning from the past, paying attention, you can learn these things about yourself.

00:17:37.313 --> 00:17:41.963
And once you learn about yourself, you can be confident in yourself because you know who you are,

00:17:42.203 --> 00:17:45.263
what you're capable of, who you're not, and what you're not capable of.

00:17:45.773 --> 00:17:51.983
That's confidence, not thinking that you're the best or better than everybody in the room and everywhere you go, that's not confidence.

00:17:53.063 --> 00:17:56.783
Confidence is just being comfortable and accepting of oneself.

00:17:57.233 --> 00:17:57.743
Period.

00:17:57.863 --> 00:18:01.703
Because when you get to that point, nobody can say anything that's going to shake you.

00:18:02.153 --> 00:18:06.053
Nobody can say anything that's going to affect you or put you down or lift you up.

00:18:07.043 --> 00:18:07.703
You do that.

00:18:08.783 --> 00:18:09.413
You see what I'm saying?

00:18:09.803 --> 00:18:10.883
That's your responsibility.

00:18:11.213 --> 00:18:15.533
Now, obviously, you know, somebody gives you a compliment that makes you feel good.

00:18:15.713 --> 00:18:19.283
Of course, I'm not saying like, you know, put this wall up.

00:18:19.283 --> 00:18:21.923
So even when somebody says something nice, you're like, nah, fuck that.

00:18:21.983 --> 00:18:22.673
I know who I am.

00:18:22.943 --> 00:18:23.813
That's not what I'm saying.

00:18:24.293 --> 00:18:30.098
I'm just saying, you know, you need to take all comments and actions objectively.

00:18:30.128 --> 00:18:32.918
And remember, at the end of the day, it says nothing about you.

00:18:33.188 --> 00:18:35.408
It's just somebody else's opinion of you.

00:18:36.248 --> 00:18:40.988
Somebody else's opinion of you or actions toward you will never define you.

00:18:41.948 --> 00:18:45.548
You define you every day when you wake up, your actions define you.

00:18:46.268 --> 00:18:46.598
You see?

00:18:47.354 --> 00:18:52.634
Anyway, man, I could talk all day about this subject, but hopefully I've gotten my point across to you.

00:18:53.144 --> 00:19:01.454
And just to summarize it in one simple idea, is the key to self-confidence is self-knowledge and you get self-knowledge by being self-aware.

00:19:02.024 --> 00:19:05.754
So start paying attention to yourself, get to know yourself.

00:19:06.369 --> 00:19:11.019
The good, the bad, the ugly inside and out the light and the dark, the positive to negative,

00:19:11.229 --> 00:19:15.309
to a point where nobody can tell you something about yourself that you don't already know.

00:19:15.999 --> 00:19:18.729
And if they can tell you something about yourself, you don't already know,

00:19:19.449 --> 00:19:25.629
you can take it objectively instead of, you know, personally letting it destroy how you feel that day,

00:19:25.839 --> 00:19:29.589
or making you feel better about yourself than you probably should.

00:19:30.669 --> 00:19:31.809
The positive or the negative.

00:19:31.839 --> 00:19:35.409
Neither one of them should have so much of an effect on you that you feel...

00:19:36.339 --> 00:19:37.959
it changes the way you feel about yourself.

00:19:38.499 --> 00:19:45.519
So understand that what people say about you or to you, or what they do to you, has nothing to do with you.

00:19:46.719 --> 00:19:52.119
So other people's actions or words should not be affecting your self-confidence at all.

00:19:53.839 --> 00:19:54.529
Not at all.

00:19:55.129 --> 00:19:55.519
Okay.

00:19:55.939 --> 00:19:59.149
So go within and figure out what's missing.

00:19:59.959 --> 00:20:05.754
What do you need from yourself to feel better about yourself, more confident in yourself?

00:20:05.814 --> 00:20:09.074
That's what you need to figure out because once you get to that point,

00:20:09.074 --> 00:20:12.624
somebody pointing and laughing at, you talking shit, criticizing you...

00:20:13.644 --> 00:20:17.664
it just rolls off you like water off a duck.

00:20:18.594 --> 00:20:19.194
You see what I'm saying?

00:20:20.784 --> 00:20:23.054
It's not easy, but it's very simple.

00:20:23.694 --> 00:20:30.534
So hopefully, this episode, this message, you know, these ideas gave you something to think about.

00:20:30.744 --> 00:20:36.924
And hopefully they help you get on the path to self-awareness then self-knowledge, then self-confidence.

00:20:38.154 --> 00:20:38.464
Peace.

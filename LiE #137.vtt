00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:02.570
Tony Kaizen:
Good morning. Good afternoon. Good evening.

2
00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:10.620
Shit! How do you start the transmission fucking up, man? Let's try that again.

3
00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:16.080
Good morning. Good afternoon. Good evening. Depending on where you are in the world.

4
00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:21.000
This is episode number 137 of the Life in English podcast.

5
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.450
I'm your host, Tony Kaizen. And in this episode,

6
00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:27.930
I'm going to play a clip of a man named Cain Kerner,

7
00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:30.760
who has five very important things to share with you today.

8
00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:33.500
Now, Cain Kerner... Actually, let me spell his name,

9
00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:40.670
C A I N, Cain, K E R N E R, Kerner. It's Cain Kerner.

10
00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:45.480
And you can actually search for him on Tik Tok. You can find this video on his Tik Tok profile.

11
00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:50.920
I came across him on Tik Tok and he had this really interesting video called

12
00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:52.170
Five Things You Need to Hear Today.

13
00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:54.940
And I thought it was very thought-provoking, so I wanted to share it with you today.

14
00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:59.550
So as always, man, I'm going to play the clip and then summarize,

15
00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:02.050
Tell you what I think and we'll get out of here, my friend.

16
00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:07.110
So let's not waste any time and let's get into this episode. I'm going to play the clip now.

17
00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:14.850
Cain Kerner:
What's poppin'? My name is Cain, and these are five things that you need to hear today. Let's go.

18
00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:19.130
Number one, discipline has a better attendance record than inspiration.

19
00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:24.820
Number two, in order to lead the orchestra, you must turn your back to the audience.

20
00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:29.150
Number three, being more assertive can help you to avoid being resentful.

21
00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:34.340
Number four, today is the tomorrow that you worried about yesterday.

22
00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:40.460
And number five, you suffer more than necessary when you suffer before it's necessary.

23
00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:46.330
Tony Kaizen:
That last one was good, bro. All right.

24
00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:50.530
So let's go all the way back to the beginning of the clip and I'll explain everything that was said.

25
00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:54.350
So at first, actually, let me just play it, then I'll explain it.

26
00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:59.580
Cain Kerner:
What's poppin'? My name is Cain, and these are five things that you need to hear today.

27
00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.550
Tony Kaizen:
So first he said "what's poppin'?". Now, you might have heard this before,

28
00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:07.170
But "what's poppin'?" is the same thing as saying, What's up?

29
00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:10.610
There's many different variations of the phrase "What's up?".

30
00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:14.430
What's poppin'? What's crackin'? What's good? What's happening? What's going on?

31
00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:17.900
You know, there's a bunch of them. But "what's poppin'?",

32
00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:22.240
I mean, even "what's up?", I guess is considered slang.

33
00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:26.030
But "what's poppin'?" is definitely slang. It's not something that everyone says.

34
00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:28.110
It just depends on where you're from and who you grew up with.

35
00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:29.910
But again, it just means "what's up?".

36
00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:35.690
So if somebody says, Hey, what's poppin', bro? They just mean what's up, in most cases. Right?

37
00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:39.060
And typically it's guys that say "What's poppin'?".

38
00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:41.420
I've never in my life heard a woman say "what's poppin'?".

39
00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:45.380
It's not that it would be weird. You can obviously say it if you want.

40
00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:50.330
I'm just trying to give you an idea of what this phrase means, who uses it and why.

41
00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:53.340
You know what I'm saying? It's just typically guys say that.

42
00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:57.410
Everyone says what's up, but what's poppin'? I've never heard a woman say that.

43
00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:00.200
But anyway, it just means "what's up?". So he said, What's poppin'?

44
00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:02.230
My name is Cain, and here are five things you need to hear today.

45
00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:05.310
So let's go ahead and hear those five things one more time.

46
00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:12.660
Cain Kerner:
Let's go. Number one, discipline has a better attendance record than inspiration.

47
00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:18.570
Tony Kaizen:
Discipline has a better attendance record than inspiration.

48
00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:22.390
Now, you might have understood that the first time hearing it.

49
00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:26.470
But just in case you didn't or even if you did, let me tell you what I think,

50
00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:31.650
Because this is a problem I see with many people, myself included,

51
00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:36.970
I used to make this mistake all the time. But in the context of learning English, right?

52
00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:39.440
This podcast is for English learners. You're learning English,

53
00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:43.870
So I'm going to try to keep it within that context. Excuse me.

54
00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:53.120
So let's say you're an English learner, what a lot of people do is they simply wait until they feel like practicing their English.

55
00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:56.070
They wait until they feel like studying English.

56
00:03:56.090 --> 00:04:01.740
They wait until they feel like talking to another person in English. You see what I'm saying?

57
00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:03.420
That's... They're waiting for inspiration.

58
00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:10.650
And I've talked before on this podcast about the difference between inspiration and motivation.

59
00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:15.560
Inspiration is just that feeling where you, where you believe you can do anything.

60
00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:19.170
You have this surge of positive energy and you can conquer the world. Right?

61
00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:23.440
You want to do, do, do. You want to take action. You feel good about it. That's inspiration.

62
00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:27.790
It comes out of nowhere. You can't predict it. You see what I'm saying?

63
00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:38.430
And just like every other feeling, happiness or sadness, or hunger, or anger, inspiration comes and goes. It comes and goes.

64
00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:44.970
You cannot depend on inspiration if you're trying to get something big and challenging done.

65
00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:47.780
You see what I'm saying? Because you never know when inspiration is going to show up.

66
00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:52.680
You never know what the attendance record of inspiration is going to be.

67
00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:57.750
And just in case you don't know, 'attendance record' is the record of how often you show up.

68
00:04:58.510 --> 00:05:01.500
Like in school, if you had perfect attendance at school,

69
00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:04.130
That means you showed up at school every single day of the year.

70
00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:09.030
You never missed a day. You were never absent. You would always attend school, right?

71
00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:14.470
So if we go back to inspiration. The attendance record of inspiration is a little shoddy, bro.

72
00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:18.470
It's a little... It's inconsistent. It's here sometimes, it's not here sometimes.

73
00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:22.230
It's never there when you need it. Right? That's inspiration.

74
00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:26.810
Now, motivation is simply, in my opinion, it's the reason for doing something.

75
00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:30.950
And that's why we say, What was the motive for that action?

76
00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:36.140
I think it comes from, those two words come from the same place. Motive, motivation, motivated.

77
00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:38.640
It means that you have a good reason to do something

78
00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:42.430
And a reason to do something has nothing to do with the feeling about doing it.

79
00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:50.750
You understand what I'm saying? Like, the motivation for learning English would be to be able to travel the world

80
00:05:50.790 --> 00:05:56.400
And be able to communicate in this universal language or get a better job or pass this English exam.

81
00:05:56.400 --> 00:06:01.520
There's a reason you're doing it. That's motivation, you understand? Not inspiration.

82
00:06:03.250 --> 00:06:09.600
So getting back to Cain's point. I'm trying to remember the exact words he said.

83
00:06:11.630 --> 00:06:15.510
Discipline has a better attendance record than inspiration.

84
00:06:17.490 --> 00:06:21.830
So we've already established that inspiration is unreliable. It comes and goes. Right?

85
00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:26.640
But discipline, forcing... Not even forcing yourself to do something,

86
00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:31.730
But choosing to maintain a productive habit over time.

87
00:06:32.830 --> 00:06:37.060
Essentially, that's discipline, right? Regardless of how you feel,

88
00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:39.870
Regardless of how much inspiration you have at the moment,

89
00:06:40.230 --> 00:06:44.670
You choose to do this thing even if you don't feel like it, right?

90
00:06:45.170 --> 00:06:49.340
Even if you don't want to, you choose to do it because you told yourself that you were going to do it.

91
00:06:49.910 --> 00:06:55.720
You choose to do it because you know the only way to be successful at it is doing it consistently. It's discipline.

92
00:06:57.540 --> 00:07:04.440
So by choosing to be disciplined, you greatly increase the chance that you're successful,

93
00:07:04.440 --> 00:07:06.540
That you actually do what you say you want to do.

94
00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:09.890
If you just rely on inspiration, you'll never fucking get it done, bro.

95
00:07:10.620 --> 00:07:16.210
You'll never get it done. And that's what a lot of people have to understand is these big,

96
00:07:16.410 --> 00:07:20.090
Challenging, long term goals, like learning a language, starting a business,

97
00:07:20.090 --> 00:07:25.600
Learning how to play the soccer, any skill or any project that takes long amounts of time

98
00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:32.330
And large amounts of effort and energy, discipline is what gets you there. Consistency.

99
00:07:33.390 --> 00:07:36.700
Understanding that you're going to wake up and there are going to be days when you don't want to do this shit,

100
00:07:36.810 --> 00:07:41.150
Whatever it is, practice English, run the business, fucking play guitar, whatever it is.

101
00:07:41.430 --> 00:07:43.310
There's going to be days when you just don't feel like it.

102
00:07:44.490 --> 00:07:49.730
And what most people do is say "Ah, tomorrow". And then tomorrow becomes next week and next week becomes next month,

103
00:07:49.730 --> 00:07:54.800
And next month becomes the next fucking year. You understand?

104
00:07:54.970 --> 00:07:59.830
Like, you don't want that. I don't even know you and I know you don't want that.

105
00:08:00.230 --> 00:08:04.720
You know what I'm saying? Do not want that. And the way you avoid that is discipline,

106
00:08:04.760 --> 00:08:09.660
Consistency, showing up every single day, regardless of whether you want to or not,

107
00:08:09.810 --> 00:08:11.360
Regardless of whether you feel like it or not.

108
00:08:12.690 --> 00:08:15.630
Because discipline has a better attendance record than inspiration.

109
00:08:15.630 --> 00:08:22.020
Discipline will show up every single fucking day, if you choose for it to show up. It's on you. You understand?

110
00:08:22.320 --> 00:08:27.300
You have control over your level of discipline, but you have zero control over your level of inspiration.

111
00:08:28.050 --> 00:08:31.840
So just something to think about. All right? But let's move on to point number two.

112
00:08:34.330 --> 00:08:39.590
Cain Kerner:
Number two, in order to lead the orchestra, you must turn your back to the audience.

113
00:08:42.050 --> 00:08:47.730
Tony Kaizen:
In order to lead the orchestra, you must be willing to turn your back to the audience.

114
00:08:47.810 --> 00:08:51.240
I actually had to think about this one for a second after I heard it.

115
00:08:51.300 --> 00:08:54.860
I even searched on the Internet just to make sure I understood what it really meant.

116
00:08:56.140 --> 00:09:02.300
And what I understand now when he says this, first of all, let me explain the language because 'an orchestra'...

117
00:09:04.060 --> 00:09:06.640
A rough definition, I don't have the dictionary in front of me,

118
00:09:06.640 --> 00:09:13.700
But a basic definition of 'an orchestra' is a group of musicians that are all playing what we call 'string instruments'.

119
00:09:14.870 --> 00:09:21.290
String instruments are instruments that are played with strings like the guitar, the violin, the cello.

120
00:09:23.170 --> 00:09:25.990
There's a bunch of other ones I'm not familiar with, but you get the point.

121
00:09:26.220 --> 00:09:28.220
Instruments like that where you play them with strings,

122
00:09:28.650 --> 00:09:32.970
And then an orchestra is typically like violins and cellos, violas.

123
00:09:34.170 --> 00:09:39.420
And I don't know the names of the other ones, but you've seen that before, at least on TV or maybe in a theater,

124
00:09:39.420 --> 00:09:43.690
A giant group of people playing these instruments and they're playing like classical music or something like that.

125
00:09:43.690 --> 00:09:50.420
That's an orchestra. So in order to lead the orchestra, the band leader, it's not a band, it's an orchestra.

126
00:09:50.420 --> 00:09:53.470
But the leader, the one that's conducting the show,

127
00:09:53.470 --> 00:09:56.560
That's one that's instructing and guiding the entire orchestra. Right?

128
00:09:57.050 --> 00:10:00.540
That person at the front. In order to be able to do their job,

129
00:10:02.380 --> 00:10:06.170
they had to turn their back to the audience. Literally. Literally.

130
00:10:06.170 --> 00:10:10.380
They have to look at the orchestra and lead them and not look at the audience

131
00:10:10.380 --> 00:10:13.130
And focus on what the audience is saying or doing or thinking.

132
00:10:14.190 --> 00:10:20.610
So if you take that and think about it metaphorically you can apply that really to anything in life,

133
00:10:20.610 --> 00:10:27.920
Whether you're the boss at a business or the team or the team captain, or even just in your personal life.

134
00:10:29.650 --> 00:10:33.040
You understand? So let's, let's just use your life, for example. I feel like that's universal.

135
00:10:34.820 --> 00:10:36.840
The orchestra in this case would also be you.

136
00:10:36.840 --> 00:10:40.560
You're, you're both the orchestra leader and the orchestra itself.

137
00:10:41.450 --> 00:10:43.700
Maybe that doesn't make sense, but just follow me for a second.

138
00:10:44.370 --> 00:10:49.580
You are responsible for yourself. Let's put it that way. And in order to live your life.

139
00:10:49.620 --> 00:10:55.350
In order to achieve what you really want to achieve, especially if it's something that's less than traditional.

140
00:10:55.350 --> 00:10:59.430
Maybe you want to travel the world for a couple of years when everybody else expects you to go to college.

141
00:10:59.720 --> 00:11:02.570
Everybody else expects you to get a 9 to 5 job or something.

142
00:11:04.150 --> 00:11:08.920
In order to do what you really want to do, in order to be successful at what you want to do,

143
00:11:08.980 --> 00:11:14.390
Whatever that is, you have to turn your back to the audience, your parents, your siblings,

144
00:11:14.390 --> 00:11:16.970
Your friends, your co-workers, strangers on the Internet.

145
00:11:17.380 --> 00:11:22.090
Everybody who has an opinion about you and what you're doing, you can't really focus on that.

146
00:11:23.750 --> 00:11:29.330
And I don't mean don't listen to people because even people you don't like can tell you stuff that you need to know. Right?

147
00:11:30.020 --> 00:11:35.380
But I'm saying you need to be objective about it. And just remember that you are responsible for yourself.

148
00:11:35.380 --> 00:11:38.410
No one else. Only you can live your life.

149
00:11:39.880 --> 00:11:44.140
And as a leader, you have to be able to deal with that type of pressure and that type of criticism.

150
00:11:44.570 --> 00:11:48.540
People talking shit or disagreeing with your choices, your lifestyle.

151
00:11:48.610 --> 00:11:52.850
You have to focus on the orchestra, the people you're trying to lead

152
00:11:52.850 --> 00:11:55.310
Because they are depending on you to be the leader, they're looking...

153
00:11:55.560 --> 00:11:58.550
Literally, the orchestra is looking at the leader for direction.

154
00:12:00.470 --> 00:12:03.960
You cannot direct him if his back is turned to them and he's looking at the audience,

155
00:12:04.400 --> 00:12:06.810
Worried about what they think. I'm sure you understand the metaphor.

156
00:12:08.340 --> 00:12:10.290
And again, you can apply that to anything in life, bro.

157
00:12:10.290 --> 00:12:14.610
You're trying to start a business with you and your friends and everybody thinks it's going to fail.

158
00:12:14.660 --> 00:12:17.220
Everybody's saying "Get a fucking job. Go to school" Blah, blah, blah.

159
00:12:17.640 --> 00:12:20.080
Turn your back to the audience and lead that fucking orchestra, bro.

160
00:12:21.170 --> 00:12:24.230
Focus on what's important. No matter what you do in life,

161
00:12:24.260 --> 00:12:28.110
There will always be people who disagree or criticize, or tear you down.

162
00:12:28.110 --> 00:12:30.340
There will always be people, I shouldn't say always,

163
00:12:31.150 --> 00:12:33.780
But they will probably be somebody who supports you as well.

164
00:12:35.020 --> 00:12:38.880
My point is on both sides, you might have positive feedback and negative feedback.

165
00:12:38.880 --> 00:12:44.170
It doesn't matter. You got to focus on leading your fucking orchestra. Nothing more.

166
00:12:45.740 --> 00:12:48.710
Hopefully, that makes sense because it's a really important point, man,

167
00:12:48.710 --> 00:12:55.990
Especially for young people or people of any age that are kind of insecure about doing things their way, living life their way.

168
00:12:56.590 --> 00:13:02.700
This is an important point to understand. There will always be critics, man.

169
00:13:02.750 --> 00:13:05.500
People will always have something to say about you and your choices.

170
00:13:05.500 --> 00:13:10.490
But as long as you know what path you're on, you're doing shit for the right reasons.

171
00:13:10.490 --> 00:13:15.250
Like, there's no reason to focus on all that shit. Just lead your orchestra.

172
00:13:15.710 --> 00:13:22.010
Who or whatever that may be, you know? All right. Let's move on to point number three.

173
00:13:24.440 --> 00:13:28.310
Cain Kerner:
Number three, being more assertive can help you to avoid being resentful.

174
00:13:32.140 --> 00:13:36.310
Tony Kaizen:
I like this one too, man. Being more assertive can help you to avoid being resentful.

175
00:13:36.760 --> 00:13:40.660
Now, I want to find the dictionary definitions of these words before we get started.

176
00:13:40.660 --> 00:13:45.160
So give me 1 second. Define assertive.

177
00:13:45.680 --> 00:13:49.500
And the reason I want to get a dictionary definition of 'assertive' is

178
00:13:49.500 --> 00:13:53.300
Because people all the time confuse the word 'assertive' with 'aggressive'. Right?

179
00:13:53.300 --> 00:13:59.820
So give me a second. Assertive. A S S E R T I V E. Assertive.

180
00:14:00.540 --> 00:14:04.490
This word means having or showing a confident and forceful personality.

181
00:14:06.200 --> 00:14:10.100
Excuse me. So, and just one second,

182
00:14:10.350 --> 00:14:14.140
I want to explain I keep burping a lot because I'm drinking a Red Bull.

183
00:14:14.140 --> 00:14:20.140
So it's like, I'm trying to talk and these fucking bubbles just keep coming up out of my stomach and I burp.

184
00:14:20.190 --> 00:14:22.410
So, sorry about that.

185
00:14:22.650 --> 00:14:28.740
But anyway, assertive, having or showing confidence or forceful personality.

186
00:14:29.570 --> 00:14:33.670
People confuse this with aggressive and let me get the definition of that as well.

187
00:14:34.100 --> 00:14:42.070
Aggressive. Aggressive is ready or likely to attack or confront,

188
00:14:42.070 --> 00:14:46.830
Characterized by or resulting from aggression. So hopefully you can see the difference.

189
00:14:47.290 --> 00:14:56.690
Assertive is more about confidence and aggressive is more about attack, aggression.

190
00:14:57.530 --> 00:15:03.270
A lot of... It's not always physical. But the idea is to attack when we talk about aggression.

191
00:15:03.730 --> 00:15:06.830
Assertiveness is just to take action.

192
00:15:08.020 --> 00:15:10.830
Whatever that action may be, to take action confidently, you know?

193
00:15:11.880 --> 00:15:19.080
So and the last word is resentful. Resentful. Resentful.

194
00:15:19.710 --> 00:15:23.880
Feeling or expressing bitterness or indignation at having been treated unfairly.

195
00:15:26.160 --> 00:15:27.370
That's what resentful means.

196
00:15:27.410 --> 00:15:31.530
So going back to the point, being more assertive can help you to avoid being resentful.

197
00:15:31.980 --> 00:15:37.560
The way I understood it, this point refers to a lot of passive-aggressive people,

198
00:15:37.770 --> 00:15:41.970
You know, those type of people that clearly have something to say or something they want to do,

199
00:15:42.990 --> 00:15:48.730
But they're afraid to do it. Because of shyness or cowardice or whatever it is,

200
00:15:49.020 --> 00:15:51.630
They're afraid to take an action or say what needs to be said.

201
00:15:52.780 --> 00:15:55.290
And they just hold it for themselves. They keep it on the inside.

202
00:15:55.290 --> 00:16:02.390
And for that reason, that bitterness, that anger, that resentment ends up manifesting itself in other ways.

203
00:16:04.100 --> 00:16:10.420
They might say something very indirect that communicates that direct thing that they're afraid to say.

204
00:16:10.660 --> 00:16:17.260
They might do something very indirect that communicates something's wrong or they're unhappy or they're unsatisfied. Right?

205
00:16:17.260 --> 00:16:24.630
That's why we call it passive-aggressive because you're passively communicating your aggression instead of directly. You understand?

206
00:16:26.360 --> 00:16:32.350
And I guess what Cain is saying is by being assertive, by confidently taking action,

207
00:16:32.350 --> 00:16:35.280
By saying what needs to be said, by saying what you're really thinking,

208
00:16:35.560 --> 00:16:38.910
By communicating that your feelings were hurt, that you didn't like what happened,

209
00:16:38.910 --> 00:16:43.140
Or that you need this thing or whatever. It could be bad or good, whatever you need to communicate.

210
00:16:43.800 --> 00:16:46.470
By being assertive and communicating that directly and clearly,

211
00:16:47.770 --> 00:16:53.760
You can avoid those feelings of resentment and bitterness, and unfair treatment. You understand?

212
00:16:53.760 --> 00:16:56.640
Because when you just hold on to it, instead of saying it or doing it,

213
00:16:56.640 --> 00:16:58.290
You're really doing nothing but poisoning yourself.

214
00:16:59.190 --> 00:17:04.260
And that's why people end up manifesting that in other ways because it starts to eat them alive on the inside.

215
00:17:04.960 --> 00:17:06.380
So they have to take action.

216
00:17:06.380 --> 00:17:10.590
They have to say it or do it in some indirect way to just get it out of themselves

217
00:17:11.010 --> 00:17:12.320
So they don't have to feel that way anymore.

218
00:17:12.970 --> 00:17:17.310
And what I think Cain is saying is you would never have to feel that way if you just said what needed to be said

219
00:17:17.800 --> 00:17:20.650
Or did what needed to be done from the beginning.

220
00:17:22.120 --> 00:17:24.400
And being assertive and saying, You know what? I didn't like that.

221
00:17:24.930 --> 00:17:26.380
Or, You know what? I'm not going to tolerate that.

222
00:17:27.930 --> 00:17:31.290
By just being direct and saying that you can avoid those feelings of resentment

223
00:17:31.290 --> 00:17:37.220
That you will inevitably feel when you choose not to say what needs to be said or do what needs to be done, you know?

224
00:17:37.220 --> 00:17:41.300
I really hope that makes sense because it's an important point, man.

225
00:17:41.300 --> 00:17:46.690
And maybe it's personal because I just really, really, really have a hard time tolerating passive-aggressive people.

226
00:17:47.860 --> 00:17:49.710
I really don't like them. You know what I'm saying?

227
00:17:50.750 --> 00:17:53.220
It's probably not, I mean, that's a negative thing to say. But I just...

228
00:17:54.580 --> 00:17:59.100
Passive aggression is the weirdest thing, dog. To me, it's just cowardice.

229
00:18:00.010 --> 00:18:01.890
It's a, it's a fancy term for cowardice.

230
00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:05.930
And I just, I don't know, I have a low tolerance for cowards, bro.

231
00:18:06.130 --> 00:18:09.870
And especially, and I say that a lot of times I talk shit on this podcast.

232
00:18:10.080 --> 00:18:14.180
I can be critical or cynical, but things I say like that, like, Man, I fucking hate a coward.

233
00:18:14.670 --> 00:18:21.940
I say that because I saw that in myself and I hated myself and that was something I had to change about myself.

234
00:18:21.940 --> 00:18:24.910
So I'm much more understanding when I find it in other people these days.

235
00:18:24.970 --> 00:18:28.310
But still, it's just something that it's hard to deal with. It's cowardice.

236
00:18:29.360 --> 00:18:33.130
It was hard to deal with in myself. I couldn't take it anymore, so I had to change it.

237
00:18:33.240 --> 00:18:37.550
You know what I'm saying? And I guess that's why I don't like seeing it in other people.

238
00:18:37.910 --> 00:18:40.390
And there's a quote that I'm trying to... I don't want to fuck it up,

239
00:18:40.390 --> 00:18:43.490
But it makes me think of a quote that I heard a long time ago.

240
00:18:43.490 --> 00:18:49.890
And somebody said something like, When you find a person and there's something about them you don't like,

241
00:18:50.870 --> 00:18:55.650
What you're really doing is seeing something that you don't like about yourself.

242
00:18:57.420 --> 00:19:02.260
When you find a quality in somebody that you don't like or something that irritates you is because you identify with that quality.

243
00:19:02.600 --> 00:19:06.390
You see it in yourself. Every person is in some way like a mirror.

244
00:19:07.590 --> 00:19:10.860
So when you see like, for example, I don't like cowardice.

245
00:19:10.960 --> 00:19:16.050
So when I see somebody being a coward, some part inside me identifies with that,

246
00:19:16.050 --> 00:19:18.480
And that's why I don't like it. It's not about that person.

247
00:19:19.380 --> 00:19:24.080
It's about that quality that I've found in myself at some point that I identify with for some reason.

248
00:19:24.080 --> 00:19:27.810
And I don't know if that makes sense to you, but when I heard that, it just made me think,

249
00:19:27.810 --> 00:19:34.070
Man, that there might be some truth to that. It's never that we don't like that specific person.

250
00:19:34.070 --> 00:19:38.180
There's a quality inside them that we identify with and we don't like that quality.

251
00:19:38.180 --> 00:19:40.400
But it's not the person, you know?

252
00:19:40.740 --> 00:19:44.670
But anyway, that has nothing to do with the point that Cain made,

253
00:19:44.670 --> 00:19:47.850
Which is being more assertive can help you to avoid being resentful.

254
00:19:47.920 --> 00:19:52.360
Hopefully, the point made sense. If it didn't, you know, hit me up and I'll try to clarify.

255
00:19:53.010 --> 00:19:54.780
But anyway, let's move on to point number four.

256
00:19:58.240 --> 00:20:02.120
Cain Kerner:
Number four, today is the tomorrow that you worried about yesterday.

257
00:20:03.810 --> 00:20:06.520
Tony Kaizen:
That's another... All these points are good, man. But that's another good one.

258
00:20:06.630 --> 00:20:08.850
Today is the tomorrow you worried about yesterday.

259
00:20:08.850 --> 00:20:11.340
And to be honest, I had to think about this one.

260
00:20:11.340 --> 00:20:14.230
It's a really simple sentence, but I had to think about what it really means.

261
00:20:16.060 --> 00:20:20.640
Excuse me. And I guess you could interpret it multiple ways, but...

262
00:20:21.510 --> 00:20:31.300
Hang on. Geez. Okay. No more Red Bulls during podcasts because goddamn, I burped, like, 15 times.

263
00:20:32.170 --> 00:20:36.170
But anyway, this phrase could be interpreted in many ways, right? I think.

264
00:20:37.020 --> 00:20:43.290
But today is the tomorrow you worried about yesterday, when I hear that,

265
00:20:43.760 --> 00:20:50.900
I think that a lot of people, myself included, have a bad habit of living in the future.

266
00:20:52.860 --> 00:20:57.310
You know, I heard recently that anxiety is simply living in the future.

267
00:20:58.350 --> 00:21:00.210
You're worried about what could happen or what might happen.

268
00:21:02.010 --> 00:21:05.000
Even though it hasn't happened yet, it's in the future, this imaginary place.

269
00:21:06.160 --> 00:21:15.270
And depression is living in the past. There's something in the past that you just can't let go of.

270
00:21:15.270 --> 00:21:18.510
You can't walk away from it. You can't overcome it.

271
00:21:19.750 --> 00:21:22.090
You're stuck there in the past and you're depressed about it.

272
00:21:22.130 --> 00:21:27.040
You're sad about something that happened that you can't change and you can't let go of.

273
00:21:28.490 --> 00:21:31.200
So living in the future is anxiety. Living in the past is depression.

274
00:21:31.200 --> 00:21:35.580
So all you really have, the only healthy way to live is living in the present.

275
00:21:37.150 --> 00:21:43.240
You know what I'm saying? And a lot of us spend so much time worrying about tomorrow, next week, next month, next year.

276
00:21:45.450 --> 00:21:48.120
But tomorrow will never come, technically.

277
00:21:48.750 --> 00:21:52.380
All you have is the present moment. So you're worried about tomorrow, tomorrow, tomorrow.

278
00:21:52.740 --> 00:21:54.760
But today is the tomorrow you worried about yesterday.

279
00:21:56.160 --> 00:21:57.850
So the question is, what are you going to do today?

280
00:21:59.050 --> 00:22:01.500
Because yesterday you were so worried about today and now here it is.

281
00:22:01.500 --> 00:22:07.460
What are you going to do? The answer for most people is, I'll worry about tomorrow, worry about the next day.

282
00:22:10.080 --> 00:22:12.830
For obvious reasons that's just a really bad idea, you know?

283
00:22:13.040 --> 00:22:16.470
But it's a, it's a weird... It's a weird balancing act, you know what I'm saying?

284
00:22:16.470 --> 00:22:25.310
Because we have to live in the present if we want to be, you know, healthy and happy, it's the only way to be.

285
00:22:26.340 --> 00:22:31.660
But at the same time, you have to think about tomorrow to prepare for tomorrow.

286
00:22:32.880 --> 00:22:36.590
So I guess the point is, even though you have to think about and prepare for the future,

287
00:22:36.590 --> 00:22:41.050
You need to live here in the present. Take action now. You know what I'm saying?

288
00:22:42.150 --> 00:22:45.460
So that tomorrow... How can I say this?

289
00:22:46.600 --> 00:22:50.860
Take action now so that you increase the chances that tomorrow is a good day and not a bad day.

290
00:22:52.180 --> 00:22:54.130
Take action now so you don't have to worry about tomorrow.

291
00:22:54.250 --> 00:23:00.410
Do everything you can today to make sure that tomorrow is as good as it can possibly be. You know?

292
00:23:01.630 --> 00:23:04.900
It's senseless to be worrying about the future all the time.

293
00:23:06.390 --> 00:23:08.420
Because the future doesn't exist. All you have is right now.

294
00:23:08.480 --> 00:23:12.160
So what are you going to do right now to make a difference?

295
00:23:12.160 --> 00:23:14.780
That's all that matters because that's all you have control over. You know?

296
00:23:15.150 --> 00:23:20.480
I think that's the main point. I would love to hear how you guys interpret this phrase, though,

297
00:23:20.480 --> 00:23:23.170
Because again, I think you can interpret it more than one way.

298
00:23:23.410 --> 00:23:27.710
But that's more or less what I took from it. All right? So let's get on to this last point.

299
00:23:29.520 --> 00:23:31.710
Cain Kerner:
Tomorrow that you're worried about yesterday.

300
00:23:32.050 --> 00:23:33.980
Tony Kaizen:
That is not the last point. Here we go.

301
00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:41.050
Cain Kerner:
And number five, you suffer more than necessary when you suffer before it's necessary.

302
00:23:43.660 --> 00:23:47.290
Tony Kaizen:
I think this one is not a continuation of point number four, but it's similar, right?

303
00:23:47.290 --> 00:23:52.590
You suffer more than necessary when you suffer before it's necessary.

304
00:23:54.420 --> 00:23:58.080
It's a really good one. And this one specifically, I think is for the anxious people,

305
00:23:58.440 --> 00:24:03.200
The ones that are always living in the future. Because as a matter of fact, I'll give you an example.

306
00:24:03.200 --> 00:24:07.790
One of my friends, she wants to be an au pair. And just in case you don't know what that is,

307
00:24:08.270 --> 00:24:11.750
An au pair is basically a caregiver or a nanny or something like that,

308
00:24:12.120 --> 00:24:18.110
that will move to a foreign country and live with this family in exchange for a place to live and food to eat and stuff like that.

309
00:24:18.510 --> 00:24:21.810
The au pair will take care of the family's children, just like a nanny.

310
00:24:22.940 --> 00:24:28.770
And actually, I don't know what episode number it was, but I interviewed an au pair on this podcast.

311
00:24:28.770 --> 00:24:31.960
So if you're interested in what the life of an au pair is like,

312
00:24:33.560 --> 00:24:37.400
Then search for the episode "The Life of an Au Pair with Alondra Sandoval".

313
00:24:38.570 --> 00:24:41.810
I don't remember the number, but it's recent, so you'll find it.

314
00:24:42.630 --> 00:24:45.010
But anyway, my friend wants to be an au pair as well.

315
00:24:45.810 --> 00:24:50.790
And she joined the program, you know, years ago. I don't know how many years ago.

316
00:24:50.790 --> 00:24:54.390
And she was having a hard time finding a family and then COVID happened.

317
00:24:54.390 --> 00:24:56.860
So everything got shut down and nobody was traveling.

318
00:24:57.560 --> 00:25:00.750
And then she kind of, not gave up on the idea,

319
00:25:00.750 --> 00:25:04.750
But she kind of realized it was going to be a long time before things went back to normal

320
00:25:05.460 --> 00:25:08.070
And she got a chance to meet more families and actually travel.

321
00:25:08.820 --> 00:25:12.180
So she got a job and everything and was just kind of like waiting to see what happen.

322
00:25:13.460 --> 00:25:17.650
And at some point, she changed her destination. She wanted to come to the U.S.,

323
00:25:17.710 --> 00:25:20.320
But then she realized there were more opportunities in Europe.

324
00:25:20.860 --> 00:25:24.800
So she decided she wanted to go to Europe. And this whole time we're talking about it,

325
00:25:24.800 --> 00:25:27.210
and she's just really nervous about all these things.

326
00:25:27.210 --> 00:25:31.240
Like, what if I can't find a family? What if I run out of time? What if I lose the money?

327
00:25:31.240 --> 00:25:33.520
What if they don't like me? What if somebody else takes my spot?

328
00:25:33.520 --> 00:25:35.090
What if this? What if that? What if that?

329
00:25:35.540 --> 00:25:37.620
Just worried about all of these things that could go wrong.

330
00:25:39.020 --> 00:25:42.820
Worried about all these things that might happen or might not happen. You understand?

331
00:25:43.230 --> 00:25:48.750
She just... She was just stressing herself out. Nobody or nothing was stressing her out.

332
00:25:48.750 --> 00:25:55.010
She was stressing herself out by worrying about all these things in this imaginary future that might happen.

333
00:25:55.010 --> 00:26:03.630
Let me say that again, worrying about all these things that might happen. You understand?

334
00:26:04.320 --> 00:26:08.680
There's a.. The list of things that might happen is fucking infinite. It's infinite.

335
00:26:09.910 --> 00:26:13.860
So by worrying about things that might happen, you're just stressing yourself out for no reason.

336
00:26:13.860 --> 00:26:18.740
You're suffering more than necessary because you're suffering before it's necessary.

337
00:26:19.190 --> 00:26:22.420
So, and I'm sure you understand, but just in case and for anyone who doesn't,

338
00:26:22.420 --> 00:26:25.820
Let me explain what that really means using that same example.

339
00:26:25.850 --> 00:26:29.810
So she's worried about all these things for months and months and months.

340
00:26:29.810 --> 00:26:30.910
We're talking about it all the time.

341
00:26:31.810 --> 00:26:37.210
Finally, she finds multiple families that she likes and families that are interested in her, and all these things.

342
00:26:37.480 --> 00:26:40.480
And she's nervous about that too. What if I choose the wrong family?

343
00:26:40.760 --> 00:26:43.910
What if the family finds somebody else and I lose that option and blah blah blah.

344
00:26:44.700 --> 00:26:47.510
Worried about that too. And at the end of it all,

345
00:26:47.510 --> 00:26:50.000
She finds the perfect family that she has a great connection with.

346
00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:52.870
She signs the contract. She's going to Europe at the end of this year.

347
00:26:53.050 --> 00:27:01.740
Everything worked out. Everything. So all of that anxiety, all of that suffering,

348
00:27:01.740 --> 00:27:07.800
All that stress that she put on herself for years was unnecessary.

349
00:27:07.800 --> 00:27:14.180
It did nothing positive for... It had no positive impact on the result.

350
00:27:15.650 --> 00:27:17.780
In fact, all that shit she was worrying about didn't even happen.

351
00:27:17.780 --> 00:27:22.480
She found a family that she actually wants to work with, in a country she actually wants to visit.

352
00:27:22.820 --> 00:27:25.510
She's learning this new language now. Everything worked out.

353
00:27:28.340 --> 00:27:33.390
There was no reason to be all stressed and anxious about all this shit because it worked out. Right?

354
00:27:34.670 --> 00:27:37.110
So she did all that suffering before it was necessary,

355
00:27:37.390 --> 00:27:40.950
Because if nothing would have worked out and she would have lost her program money

356
00:27:40.950 --> 00:27:46.550
And found no family and everything went to shit, then she would have a reason to,

357
00:27:46.550 --> 00:27:48.820
Let's say, suffer or be sad or disappointed.

358
00:27:48.990 --> 00:27:52.010
But even then, even if nothing worked out and everything went to shit,

359
00:27:52.290 --> 00:27:55.330
All that suffering before that moment was still unnecessary.

360
00:27:55.330 --> 00:27:58.720
It has no effect on the outcome of the situation.

361
00:27:58.720 --> 00:28:03.150
So she suffered before things went to shit and then she suffered after things went to shit.

362
00:28:04.160 --> 00:28:07.120
Why would you suffer twice for no reason? That's the point.

363
00:28:08.380 --> 00:28:10.080
But in her case, shit actually did work out.

364
00:28:10.080 --> 00:28:13.440
So why would you suffer all that time and things worked out in the end?

365
00:28:13.680 --> 00:28:18.560
It's like, What's what's the point? There's no reason.

366
00:28:20.080 --> 00:28:22.690
So sitting and worrying about what might happen, what could happen,

367
00:28:22.690 --> 00:28:25.770
This or that and the third, you're suffering for no reason.

368
00:28:26.360 --> 00:28:31.670
You're putting yourself through all this anxiety and stress before you even know what's going to happen.

369
00:28:31.740 --> 00:28:33.390
Everything might work out perfectly fine,

370
00:28:33.420 --> 00:28:38.450
And then all that time and energy turns out to be wasted. You know what I'm saying?

371
00:28:39.610 --> 00:28:44.860
So... Hey, man, I would just say except what you can't control,

372
00:28:46.170 --> 00:28:52.650
Do every single thing in your power to increase the chance that what you want to happen actually happens.

373
00:28:52.650 --> 00:28:57.210
But after you do that, you've got to sit back and accept the fact you can't control nothing else, bro.

374
00:28:57.240 --> 00:29:05.930
So why stress about it? Like, stress has actual health implications, you understand?

375
00:29:05.930 --> 00:29:11.950
Like, just constantly being stressed and anxious has a negative effect on your physical and mental health.

376
00:29:13.030 --> 00:29:20.160
You're choosing to feel stressed and anxious about this, You're choosing to focus on that negativity.

377
00:29:20.450 --> 00:29:22.830
You're choosing to suffer before it's necessary.

378
00:29:22.890 --> 00:29:28.380
So you're choosing to fuck up your own health just because you can't accept the fact that there are things you cannot control.

379
00:29:29.660 --> 00:29:30.900
Maybe you don't think about it that way,

380
00:29:30.900 --> 00:29:35.780
But when I break it down to the essential idea, that's what it is. You know?

381
00:29:36.730 --> 00:29:38.610
A lot of people suffer with that, myself included.

382
00:29:38.700 --> 00:29:43.480
I've had to work on it over, over time and just like, understand like,

383
00:29:43.480 --> 00:29:47.670
Shit, I really want this thing. I really want this thing to happen or whatever.

384
00:29:48.370 --> 00:29:51.390
But I've done all I can do. I can't control anything else.

385
00:29:51.390 --> 00:29:55.090
I just have to exhibit faith and patience and see what happens.

386
00:29:56.710 --> 00:29:58.140
And shit is just so much easier that way.

387
00:29:58.140 --> 00:30:00.680
There's no reason, there's never a reason to suffer twice.

388
00:30:03.220 --> 00:30:07.470
There's never a reason to suffer before and after something happens. There's no reason.

389
00:30:09.170 --> 00:30:12.430
So, that's it, man. That's it.

390
00:30:12.430 --> 00:30:14.530
Let me summarize these five points and we'll get out of here, man.

391
00:30:14.530 --> 00:30:17.900
Number one... Is what, Tony?

392
00:30:18.400 --> 00:30:22.310
Number one, discipline has a better attendance record than inspiration.

393
00:30:23.260 --> 00:30:27.920
Number two, in order to lead the orchestra, you must turn your back to the audience.

394
00:30:28.590 --> 00:30:32.670
Number three, being more assertive can help you to avoid being resentful.

395
00:30:33.660 --> 00:30:37.400
Number four, today is the tomorrow you worried about yesterday.

396
00:30:38.300 --> 00:30:44.700
And number five, you suffer more than necessary when you suffer before it's necessary.

397
00:30:46.550 --> 00:30:48.560
This is Life in English. I'm your host, Tony Kaizen.

398
00:30:48.820 --> 00:30:50.820
I want to thank you so much for your time and your attention.

399
00:30:50.820 --> 00:30:55.720
I. Hope you enjoyed the episode and I will definitely talk to you soon. Peace!

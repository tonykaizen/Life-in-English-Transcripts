What's up, everybody?

00:00:00.930 --> 00:00:03.390
You're listening to another episode of Life in English.

00:00:03.390 --> 00:00:05.450
I'm your host Tony Kaizen.

00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:13.570
And this episode is a reminder to always keep it a hundred.

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:20.190
All right, y'all in this episode, we are going to take a trip down South to New Orleans, Louisiana.

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:27.119
I found another interesting clip that will not only expose you to more real American English, but also send you a valuable message.

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:29.520
So first, I'll play the clip from start to finish

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:35.100
and next I'll walk you through the clip line by line to make sure you understand everything that is being said.

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:39.750
And don't feel if you don't understand the clip, the first time you hear it,

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:44.310
the New Orleans accent is very particular and it's hard to understand if you're not familiar with it.

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:48.690
But let's not waste any more time, let's get into this episode.

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:56.210
See, you could be a hundred to people every day, all day.

00:00:57.230 --> 00:00:57.600
You heard me?

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:01.280
And they could be fifty to you every day, all day.

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:02.360
And it's all good.

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:07.490
But once you catch on to them being a fifty and you always being a hundred,

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:10.880
and you start moving differently, guess what they do.

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:12.470
They get mad at you.

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:18.400
'Cause you done caught on to they fake bullshit they bringing to the table, and they doing, and what they want to do.

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:21.560
They want to play victim and act like you doing them some bad.

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:24.900
When the whole time you been a hundred and they been fifty.

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:25.720
But guess what?

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:27.520
Fuck them people, man.

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:29.170
Fuck them.

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:29.760
Real talk.

00:01:30.033 --> 00:01:32.020
At the end of the day, fuck them people.

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:33.160
You heard me?

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:36.520
In the middle of the night, fuck them people.

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:37.380
Move around them people.

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:40.090
Let them be fifty with the fifty people they want to be fifty with.

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:41.380
You keep being a hundred.

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:43.600
Don't let them fifties stop you from being a hundred.

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:45.620
You always keep a thousand.

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:45.980
You heard me?

00:01:46.135 --> 00:01:46.945
No matter what.

00:01:47.545 --> 00:01:50.515
Just lay there and clear your catalog, close your circle.

00:01:51.955 --> 00:01:58.505
All right, y'all, like I said before, don't feel bad if you couldn't understand the entire clip or even the majority of it.

00:01:58.835 --> 00:02:00.664
I'm sure there are even some  people in the U.S.

00:02:00.664 --> 00:02:04.085
that would have a hard time understanding this accent and dialect.

00:02:04.295 --> 00:02:07.764
So first, let me explain what it means when we say 'keep it a hundred'.

00:02:08.285 --> 00:02:10.985
To keep it a hundred simply means to stay true to yourself.

00:02:11.745 --> 00:02:17.595
In other words, it means to be yourself and live by your values, no matter what someone else says or thinks about it.

00:02:17.954 --> 00:02:24.195
So, 'keep it' means to maintain it the way it is or to maintain it in your possession.

00:02:24.465 --> 00:02:30.734
Now, the idea of a hundred is that the number 100 represents completeness or fullness.

00:02:30.975 --> 00:02:36.195
Like when you get a hundred percent on your English exam or you feel a hundred percent healthy, right?

00:02:36.405 --> 00:02:40.605
So if you're keeping it in a hundred, you're being a hundred percent, your authentic self.

00:02:41.275 --> 00:02:41.515
Right?

00:02:42.365 --> 00:02:47.340
Now, to keep it a hundred can also mean to be honest, which is more or less the same thing, depending on how you look at it.

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:50.670
For example, I might say, "I'ma keep it a hundred with you."

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:54.360
And just in case you couldn't understand that, another way or...

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:56.490
yeah, another way of saying that is,

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:59.460
"I'm going to keep it one hundred with you."

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:00.690
But naturally I would say.

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:02.250
"I'ma keep it a hundred with you."

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:06.120
Which is the same thing as saying, "I'm going to be completely honest with you."

00:03:07.454 --> 00:03:08.665
I'm gonna keep it a hundred with you, bro.

00:03:08.805 --> 00:03:10.155
Like, I'm gonna be honest with you.

00:03:10.394 --> 00:03:11.025
You see what I'm saying?

00:03:11.685 --> 00:03:14.055
Now, there are a few variations of this phrase as well,

00:03:14.445 --> 00:03:24.345
so we can say keep it a hundred or keep it a thousand, keep it a band, keep it a stack, keep it all the way tall or simply keep it real.

00:03:24.945 --> 00:03:26.565
Like I said, these all mean the same thing.

00:03:26.865 --> 00:03:30.144
So when you think of a thousand, it's a hundred times ten.

00:03:30.165 --> 00:03:33.225
So it's just kind of, like, emphasis on the phrase.

00:03:33.225 --> 00:03:38.505
You're saying all the way real, one hundred and fifty percent, a thousand percent real and authentic.

00:03:38.835 --> 00:03:42.195
Now, the word 'band', in this case, is slang for a thousand.

00:03:42.645 --> 00:03:44.325
And the same thing with the word 'stack'.

00:03:44.385 --> 00:03:46.395
A stack is $1,000.

00:03:46.725 --> 00:03:51.435
So to keep it a band or keep it a stack needs to keep it a thousand, which means to keep it a hundred.

00:03:51.495 --> 00:03:52.125
You see what I'm saying?

00:03:52.725 --> 00:04:01.885
And to keep it all the way tall is similar to the phrase straight up, which just means honest or direct or a hundred percent real.

00:04:01.915 --> 00:04:03.295
Now, I don't want to start to confuse you.

00:04:03.325 --> 00:04:06.025
So we'll stay focused on this phrase for now.

00:04:06.715 --> 00:04:09.285
And just remember that at the end of the day, they all mean the same thing.

00:04:09.325 --> 00:04:12.685
Keep it real, keep it a band, keep it all the way tall, keep it a hundred.

00:04:13.105 --> 00:04:13.765
It's all the same.

00:04:14.395 --> 00:04:17.635
So now you should understand the meaning of the phrase, keep it a hundred.

00:04:17.815 --> 00:04:23.755
So let's listen to the clip again, so you can understand everything that was said and the true message of this man's words.

00:04:24.315 --> 00:04:24.791
So let's do it.

00:04:27.534 --> 00:04:33.435
See, you can be a hundred to people every day, all day, you heard me?

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:35.440
Alright.

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:39.670
See, you can be a hundred to people every day, all day.

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:40.660
You heard me?

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:43.300
So there's was a couple of things I want to explain in this line.

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:47.050
The first one, the pronunciation of the words, a hundred.

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:51.250
It's very common here in the U.S., depending on where you're from and what your culture is,

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:53.530
we don't pronounce the words a hundred.

00:04:54.284 --> 00:04:57.765
It's much faster and easier, um, to say, 'uh hunnid'.

00:04:58.744 --> 00:04:59.264
'Uh hunnid'.

00:04:59.474 --> 00:05:03.085
You can be a hundred with people, or you can be one hundred or a hundred.

00:05:03.375 --> 00:05:05.565
It's the same thing, just a difference of pronunciation.

00:05:05.835 --> 00:05:08.805
So then he said, "You heard me?"

00:05:09.015 --> 00:05:10.094
at the end of the sentence.

00:05:10.455 --> 00:05:10.965
You heard me?

00:05:11.414 --> 00:05:13.935
And this is a phrase that's very particular to New Orleans.

00:05:13.935 --> 00:05:22.115
I don't know if they say in other parts of Louisiana or in other states near Louisiana, but I know for sure in New Orleans they say, "You heard me?"

00:05:22.705 --> 00:05:25.140
Which is the words 'you heard me'.

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:26.100
Right?

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:31.080
And technically the grammatically correct way to ask, 'cause it is a question,

00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:34.110
so the grammatically correct way to say that is, "Did you hear me?"

00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:34.770
Right?

00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:39.660
But a more, let's say, informal way of asking the question is, "You heard me?"

00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:40.440
Right?

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:43.350
And that's the same thing as saying, you feel me, you dig what I'm saying.

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:44.850
Do you understand what I'm saying?

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:45.930
Can you identify?

00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:46.680
Are you following?

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:47.900
You heard me?

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:53.430
It's very particular to New Orleans, maybe Louisiana, but I'm not sure, but definitely New Orleans.

00:05:53.430 --> 00:06:00.360
And you're going to hear that a lot in this clip, but also, probably when
you're talking to some people from new Orleans or listening to music from there.

00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:00.960
All right.

00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:02.720
So let's move on to the next line

00:06:05.810 --> 00:06:10.370
And they can be fifty to you everyday, all day.

00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:11.360
And it's all good.

00:06:12.810 --> 00:06:16.260
And they can be fifty to you every day, all day.

00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:17.430
And it's all good.

00:06:17.700 --> 00:06:19.290
So there's two things I want to explain here.

00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:23.790
The first one is the pronunciation of the word, fifty F I F T Y.

00:06:23.850 --> 00:06:24.810
The number, let's say,

00:06:25.350 --> 00:06:28.340
and he didn't say fifty, he said fitty...

00:06:29.580 --> 00:06:30.300
fitty.

00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:36.720
Now, again, depending on where you're from, you might say fifty, or you might say fifty, fifty is faster and easier.

00:06:37.350 --> 00:06:39.695
Um, So it's really your choice.

00:06:40.175 --> 00:06:43.325
I'm just trying to get you to understand what he actually said.

00:06:43.595 --> 00:06:45.515
And it's just a difference of pronunciation.

00:06:45.515 --> 00:06:49.385
Some people say fifty, some people say fifty, so there you go.

00:06:49.715 --> 00:06:54.215
And at the end of that sentence, he said, it's all good, which is three words.

00:06:54.275 --> 00:06:56.135
It's all good.

00:06:56.465 --> 00:06:58.295
But he kind of blended those words together.

00:06:58.325 --> 00:07:01.455
Using connected speech and said is'sall'good.

00:07:02.195 --> 00:07:02.975
It's all good.

00:07:03.425 --> 00:07:03.695
You see?

00:07:03.725 --> 00:07:06.275
And when we say it's all good, it just means everything is fine.

00:07:06.275 --> 00:07:07.055
There's no problems.

00:07:07.115 --> 00:07:13.860
So you can be a hundred with people, you can be real, you can be authentic and somebody else can still be fake with you.

00:07:14.190 --> 00:07:15.570
And for them it's no problem.

00:07:15.570 --> 00:07:16.320
It's all good.

00:07:16.770 --> 00:07:17.070
Right?

00:07:18.180 --> 00:07:18.390
All right.

00:07:18.420 --> 00:07:19.260
Hopefully, that makes sense.

00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:20.820
So let's move on to the next line.

00:07:23.790 --> 00:07:24.810
And it's all good.

00:07:25.380 --> 00:07:33.330
But once you catch on to them being a fifty and you always being a hundred and you start moving differently, guess what they do.

00:07:33.840 --> 00:07:34.950
They get mad at you.

00:07:36.405 --> 00:07:36.675
All right.

00:07:36.675 --> 00:07:37.094
There's a lot.

00:07:37.094 --> 00:07:40.875
I need to explain in that idea right there.

00:07:40.875 --> 00:07:43.914
He said, but once you catch on to them being fifty.

00:07:43.935 --> 00:07:45.135
So the first thing is catch on.

00:07:45.810 --> 00:07:50.070
The phrasal verb catch on basically means to start to understand something.

00:07:50.099 --> 00:07:57.990
And we typically use catch on in a case where it takes you some time to start to understand what's going on or what's happening.

00:07:58.080 --> 00:07:58.650
You see what I'm saying?

00:07:58.680 --> 00:08:02.610
So these people can be fifty% real and authentic with you.

00:08:02.850 --> 00:08:08.490
They can be fake with you, and it might take you some time to start to understand or really see what's happening, you know?

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:13.540
So once you catch on to them, being a fifty and you always being 100,

00:08:14.340 --> 00:08:17.520
and you start moving differently, which is the next thing I want to explain.

00:08:17.670 --> 00:08:18.810
He says, moving differently.

00:08:18.820 --> 00:08:20.490
He doesn't mean, like, physically moving.

00:08:20.790 --> 00:08:26.460
When we say moving in this case, when you start moving differently, he means start behaving differently.

00:08:26.590 --> 00:08:28.290
You start acting differently, right?

00:08:28.290 --> 00:08:30.790
We're talking about how you move through the world or through life.

00:08:30.810 --> 00:08:31.710
It's more figurative.

00:08:31.920 --> 00:08:38.100
So your behavior, your decisions, your actions, your words, and all that, all of that is included in the way you move.

00:08:38.804 --> 00:08:40.275
The way you behave, you see?

00:08:40.454 --> 00:08:47.204
So you start moving differently, you start acting or behaving differently, and guess what they do, they get mad at you.

00:08:47.775 --> 00:08:49.214
And that's the last thing I want to explain here.

00:08:49.214 --> 00:08:50.655
'Cause he said they get mad at you.

00:08:51.525 --> 00:08:53.235
So you might notice, it sounds a little different.

00:08:53.235 --> 00:08:59.834
It's not at you because the word at ends with the letter T and the word you starts with the letter Y.

00:09:00.045 --> 00:09:05.125
So in almost every case where that happens, a lot of Americans will say 'tchu'.

00:09:05.340 --> 00:09:11.040
The, the word that ends with a T that's followed by a word that starts with a Y makes a 'tcha' sound.

00:09:11.250 --> 00:09:16.680
So instead of saying at you, we connect them and say at you, they get mad at you.

00:09:17.370 --> 00:09:17.640
Okay?

00:09:17.640 --> 00:09:19.200
So one more time, the whole idea.

00:09:19.440 --> 00:09:23.340
Once you start to understand and become aware of the fake shit that's going on

00:09:23.580 --> 00:09:27.420
and you start to move differently or behave differently, guess what happens?

00:09:27.690 --> 00:09:29.700
They get mad at you.

00:09:30.540 --> 00:09:30.930
Okay.

00:09:31.260 --> 00:09:32.250
Hopefully that makes sense.

00:09:32.520 --> 00:09:33.990
And we gon' move on to the next line.

00:09:37.845 --> 00:09:38.655
Guess what they do.

00:09:39.165 --> 00:09:46.155
They get mad at you 'cause you done caught on to they fake bullshit they bringing to the table  and they doing and what they wanna do.

00:09:47.865 --> 00:09:48.225
All right.

00:09:48.435 --> 00:09:50.295
A lot of stuff to explain here, my friend.

00:09:50.355 --> 00:09:51.015
So here we go.

00:09:51.255 --> 00:09:54.285
He says, 'cause you done caught on to they fake bullshit.

00:09:55.155 --> 00:09:59.325
So the first thing you probably know, but just in case you don't, he said, because you done caught on

00:09:59.655 --> 00:10:00.755
and 'cause, in this case...

00:10:01.470 --> 00:10:03.960
A lot of Americans will say, 'cause instead of because.

00:10:04.230 --> 00:10:08.070
The complete word is because, but we kind of shorten it and just say, 'cause, all right?

00:10:08.340 --> 00:10:10.890
So the next thing is you done caught on.

00:10:11.910 --> 00:10:14.280
So here he is, he's using the present perfect.

00:10:14.640 --> 00:10:17.580
But according to the grammar rules, it's grammatically incorrect.

00:10:17.580 --> 00:10:21.930
'Cause he should say you have caught on, but a lot of places in the U.S.

00:10:21.930 --> 00:10:24.360
depending on your culture, the region and things like that,

00:10:24.630 --> 00:10:26.930
a lot of people would say you done caught on.

00:10:27.350 --> 00:10:32.925
Anytime they're using the present perfect, instead of saying 'have' and then the verb, they say 'done' and then the verb.

00:10:33.045 --> 00:10:37.815
You done caught on, or you done seen, or you done gone where you done been,

00:10:37.845 --> 00:10:41.925
instead of you have been, you have caught on, you have seen, you have done.

00:10:42.585 --> 00:10:43.035
Why?

00:10:43.785 --> 00:10:47.115
I don't know, but just understand technically it's grammatically incorrect,

00:10:47.415 --> 00:10:53.140
but you will hear it, you know, depending on the region or the person you're talking to in the U.S.

00:10:53.430 --> 00:10:53.700
All right?

00:10:53.820 --> 00:10:56.460
So you should know what caught on means at this point.

00:10:56.670 --> 00:11:01.439
So you done caught on, or you have caught on to they fake bullshit.

00:11:02.160 --> 00:11:07.740
Another case where he said they, but technically he should have said their fake bullshit,

00:11:07.770 --> 00:11:10.590
because we're talking about the bullshit that belongs to them.

00:11:10.620 --> 00:11:11.310
It's theirs.

00:11:11.550 --> 00:11:13.920
It's not they, it's their bullshit.

00:11:14.310 --> 00:11:14.850
You see what I'm saying?

00:11:15.090 --> 00:11:18.330
But again, depending on where you are, a lot of people speak this way.

00:11:18.450 --> 00:11:22.530
Instead of saying their they say, they, I don't know why, but they do.

00:11:22.560 --> 00:11:26.250
So instead of saying, like, their bullshit or their kids or their money,

00:11:26.310 --> 00:11:28.590
they would say they bullshit, they kids, they money.

00:11:29.610 --> 00:11:32.010
But what they mean to say is their, technically.

00:11:32.250 --> 00:11:32.550
All right?

00:11:32.850 --> 00:11:33.960
And fake bullshit.

00:11:34.440 --> 00:11:35.520
You should know what fake means.

00:11:35.520 --> 00:11:38.130
It's just the opposite of real, the opposite of authentic.

00:11:38.130 --> 00:11:40.620
And bullshit, in this case, it's kind of like nonsense.

00:11:40.950 --> 00:11:42.180
They fake nonsense.

00:11:42.900 --> 00:11:46.935
Ridiculousness, you know, that's the basic idea.

00:11:47.265 --> 00:11:53.445
So you have caught on to their fake bullshit that they bringing to the table.

00:11:53.745 --> 00:11:59.085
Another case where he said they, and he should have said they're, or they are because we're using the present continuous here.

00:11:59.505 --> 00:12:05.355
The fake bullshit that they are bringing to the table, but he said the fake shit that they bringing to the table.

00:12:05.895 --> 00:12:07.215
It's just faster to say it that way.

00:12:07.215 --> 00:12:12.204
And again, it's incorrect grammatically, but a lot of people speak that way.

00:12:12.385 --> 00:12:12.685
All right?

00:12:12.925 --> 00:12:17.064
So bring to the table, the fake shit that they are bringing to the table.

00:12:17.964 --> 00:12:20.365
To bring something to the table means to contribute something.

00:12:21.150 --> 00:12:23.939
So if somebody asks you, "What do you bring to the table?"

00:12:24.540 --> 00:12:26.430
They're saying, what do you have to contribute?

00:12:26.579 --> 00:12:30.780
What are you contributing to this situation or relationship or whatever it is.

00:12:30.990 --> 00:12:36.959
So you have caught on to they fake bullshit that they bringing to the table or bringing to the relationship.

00:12:37.349 --> 00:12:37.920
You see what I'm saying?

00:12:38.910 --> 00:12:41.400
And they doing and what they want to do.

00:12:41.430 --> 00:12:42.450
That's the last thing he said.

00:12:42.945 --> 00:12:46.305
And that they doing and they want to do, and this was kind of redundant.

00:12:46.305 --> 00:12:48.285
So it's hard to explain that entire thing.

00:12:48.435 --> 00:12:52.455
So let me play it one more time and I'll try to explain the last part of that idea.

00:12:56.245 --> 00:13:01.665
Because you done caught on to they fake bullshit they bringing to the table and they doing, and what they want to do.

00:13:02.325 --> 00:13:05.835
So he said that they bringing to the table, and they doing, and what they want to do.

00:13:06.615 --> 00:13:08.745
Just kind of being redundant at this point.

00:13:08.745 --> 00:13:11.415
'Cause he's saying the fake shit that they are bringing to the table.

00:13:12.255 --> 00:13:15.405
And then he continues to say that they doing and that they want to do.

00:13:15.885 --> 00:13:17.955
And he's still talking about the fake bullshit.

00:13:18.645 --> 00:13:21.855
So the fake bullshit, that one, they are bringing to the table,

00:13:22.165 --> 00:13:23.865
two, that they are doing,

00:13:24.015 --> 00:13:25.725
and three, that they want to do.

00:13:26.325 --> 00:13:27.405
Hopefully, that makes sense.

00:13:27.645 --> 00:13:34.125
And the last thing I want to explain is he said that they doing another case where he should say they are doing, but he said they doing,

00:13:34.155 --> 00:13:36.105
I guess it's just faster and easier.

00:13:36.555 --> 00:13:38.025
And that they want to do...

00:13:39.135 --> 00:13:39.555
that.

00:13:40.844 --> 00:13:42.314
Oh, no, he said, "What they want to do."

00:13:42.704 --> 00:13:43.605
"And what they want to do."

00:13:44.145 --> 00:13:49.635
So the last thing I want to bring your attention here is instead of saying what they want to do,

00:13:50.064 --> 00:13:52.694
he used connect to speech and said, "they wanna do."

00:13:53.564 --> 00:13:54.555
"And what they wanna do."

00:13:55.185 --> 00:13:55.545
Okay?

00:13:56.295 --> 00:13:57.344
Hopefully, I'm not confusing you.

00:13:57.344 --> 00:13:58.574
Hopefully, you're still with me.

00:13:58.785 --> 00:14:04.155
It's kind of difficult to explain these things because some of it is cultural, not, it's not just about the language.

00:14:04.155 --> 00:14:07.785
You know, the reason that we say certain things, even though it's grammatically incorrect,

00:14:07.785 --> 00:14:11.100
and which people say it this way, it's kind of difficult to explain it.

00:14:11.100 --> 00:14:15.060
But hopefully, you still with me, I think we're about halfway through the clip, so let's continue.

00:14:19.200 --> 00:14:20.160
And what they want to do.

00:14:20.730 --> 00:14:23.610
They wanna play victim, and act like you doing them something bad.

00:14:24.060 --> 00:14:24.990
When the whole time...

00:14:25.620 --> 00:14:25.950
All right.

00:14:25.950 --> 00:14:32.070
So the next line, they want to play victim and act like you doing them something bad.

00:14:33.150 --> 00:14:34.350
Again, a lot to explain.

00:14:34.610 --> 00:14:37.200
So, he said, "they want to play victim."

00:14:37.320 --> 00:14:40.710
Again, it's want to, and you just connect the words and say, wanna.

00:14:41.120 --> 00:14:43.560
The next thing is play victim.

00:14:43.950 --> 00:14:48.690
Now, the complete phrase is play the victim, but you can say play victim and it's the same exact thing.

00:14:48.930 --> 00:14:49.800
And what that means...

00:14:50.340 --> 00:14:53.580
he's not saying play like have fun or like it's a game or anything like that.

00:14:53.580 --> 00:14:55.530
He's saying act like the victim.

00:14:55.920 --> 00:14:59.270
To play someone or something in this context...

00:14:59.925 --> 00:15:08.385
In this context, to play the victim, to play the hero, to play the boss, to play the employee, whatever, it means to act like this thing.

00:15:08.415 --> 00:15:12.015
So if you want to play victim, it means you want to act like the victim.

00:15:12.285 --> 00:15:12.584
You see?

00:15:13.454 --> 00:15:18.525
So, so they want to play victim and act like you doing them something bad.

00:15:19.125 --> 00:15:25.835
So again, another case where we're using the present continuous, but he's not using the word 'are' in this case.

00:15:25.835 --> 00:15:27.675
He just said you doing them something bad.

00:15:27.915 --> 00:15:31.215
When technically, you should say, 'you are doing' or 'you're doing'.

00:15:31.575 --> 00:15:31.885
You see?

00:15:32.474 --> 00:15:34.485
And then he says, 'doing them something bad'.

00:15:35.385 --> 00:15:37.785
This one is a little hard to explain...

00:15:38.655 --> 00:15:39.944
doing them something bad.

00:15:41.175 --> 00:15:43.064
Because it's like a colloquial phrase that we have.

00:15:43.064 --> 00:15:47.954
If you do somebody some kind of way, it means to treat somebody some kind of way.

00:15:48.105 --> 00:15:55.740
So if you do somebody wrong, if you do her wrong or do him wrong or do me wrong, it means that you treat me wrong or incorrectly.

00:15:55.740 --> 00:15:59.640
You do something wrong to me, it's just a colloquial way of speaking.

00:15:59.640 --> 00:16:03.000
So he's saying you're doing them something bad.

00:16:03.780 --> 00:16:07.470
Probably sounds a little strange, the sentence structure, but it's very normal to us.

00:16:07.920 --> 00:16:12.900
You're doing them something bad, which is the same thing as saying you're doing something bad to them.

00:16:13.530 --> 00:16:13.770
Okay.

00:16:13.770 --> 00:16:19.290
So I wouldn't recommend that you write this way if you're trying to pass a test or the IELTS or some type of English exam,

00:16:19.500 --> 00:16:22.140
but you will hear people speak that way in the U.S.

00:16:23.700 --> 00:16:24.030
All right?

00:16:24.990 --> 00:16:25.230
Cool.

00:16:25.230 --> 00:16:26.890
Let's move on to the next line.

00:16:30.670 --> 00:16:31.850
Something bad.

00:16:31.865 --> 00:16:34.545
When the whole time you've been a hundred and  they been fifty.

00:16:34.565 --> 00:16:35.285
But guess what?

00:16:36.005 --> 00:16:37.085
Fuck them people, man.

00:16:37.935 --> 00:16:38.735
Fuck them.

00:16:38.765 --> 00:16:39.335
Real talk.

00:16:39.655 --> 00:16:41.605
At end of the day, fuck them people.

00:16:43.685 --> 00:16:44.165
All right.

00:16:44.255 --> 00:16:45.365
Actually played too much.

00:16:45.395 --> 00:16:46.085
Let me go...

00:16:46.415 --> 00:16:49.445
I played two lines instead of one, but anyway, I'll still explain.

00:16:50.165 --> 00:16:53.825
When the whole time, you've been a hundred, and  they been fifty.

00:16:54.035 --> 00:17:00.755
So the first thing I want to bring to your attention is he says, 'when the whole time', but he didn't pronounce it like that.

00:17:01.115 --> 00:17:04.575
He connected the words 'when' and 'the', and he said 'whena'.

00:17:05.375 --> 00:17:09.865
When the whole time, when the whole time you've been a hundred.

00:17:10.685 --> 00:17:15.915
'When-a-whole time', instead of when the whole time.

00:17:16.544 --> 00:17:16.875
You see?

00:17:17.115 --> 00:17:19.244
So you don't have to speak this way to sound natural.

00:17:19.274 --> 00:17:21.915
I just want you to understand every single thing that's being said

00:17:22.125 --> 00:17:27.734
and the little details and the patterns of speech and pronunciation in some people here in the U.S.

00:17:27.794 --> 00:17:28.034
All right?

00:17:28.034 --> 00:17:32.215
So when the whole time you've been a hundred and they been fifty.

00:17:32.834 --> 00:17:34.875
So, another grammar observation.

00:17:34.875 --> 00:17:37.004
He says, 'you been a hundred'.

00:17:37.425 --> 00:17:42.925
When technically, you should say 'you have been a hundred' or 'you've been a hundred'.

00:17:42.945 --> 00:17:46.605
But he omitted the verb 'have' in this case and just said, 'you been'.

00:17:47.115 --> 00:17:47.445
Okay?

00:17:47.475 --> 00:17:49.695
It's grammatically incorrect, but very common.

00:17:50.535 --> 00:17:50.805
All right.

00:17:50.805 --> 00:17:52.825
And then he said they been fifty.

00:17:52.845 --> 00:17:54.635
So you've been hundred and they been fifty.

00:17:54.885 --> 00:17:55.485
The same thing.

00:17:55.485 --> 00:17:57.594
You should say, ' they have been' fifty.

00:17:57.885 --> 00:18:00.195
But he just omits that verb from his phrase.

00:18:00.990 --> 00:18:05.730
Probably because it's faster and easier, but like I said, it's grammatically incorrect, just so you know.

00:18:06.240 --> 00:18:07.860
Then he says, "But guess what?

00:18:08.820 --> 00:18:09.810
Fuck them people, man.

00:18:10.800 --> 00:18:11.760
Fuck them people."

00:18:12.030 --> 00:18:15.540
Now, the way he pronounced the word, isn't the typical pronunciation.

00:18:15.540 --> 00:18:18.600
I think he was just putting, you know, emphasis on it.

00:18:19.380 --> 00:18:22.650
Maybe not to be funny, but he was just putting emphasis on it, just so you know.

00:18:22.650 --> 00:18:24.640
So let me play it one more time so you can hear it.

00:18:26.820 --> 00:18:27.620
And they've been fifty.

00:18:27.640 --> 00:18:28.360
But guess what?

00:18:29.110 --> 00:18:30.840
Fuck them people, man.

00:18:30.930 --> 00:18:31.830
Fuck them.

00:18:31.830 --> 00:18:32.820
Real talk.

00:18:33.130 --> 00:18:33.550
All right.

00:18:33.820 --> 00:18:34.780
Fuck them people.

00:18:34.780 --> 00:18:42.550
So I already talked about the pronunciation of fuck, but then he says, fuck them people when he should say, fuck those people.

00:18:43.360 --> 00:18:43.720
Okay?

00:18:44.020 --> 00:18:52.775
But it's just another colloquial thing, instead of saying, you know, 'them', or, excuse me, instead of saying 'those' people, we'll say 'them'.

00:18:53.155 --> 00:18:58.675
'I don't like them people', or 'I don't want them things', or some, 'I don't know them people',

00:18:58.675 --> 00:19:00.725
or something like that when you should be saying those,

00:19:01.235 --> 00:19:03.515
the grammatically correct thing to say is 'those'.

00:19:03.635 --> 00:19:03.995
Okay?

00:19:04.205 --> 00:19:05.495
He said, "fuck them people."

00:19:06.575 --> 00:19:11.015
Um, and then the next thing I want to bring to your attention is fuck them.

00:19:11.975 --> 00:19:12.755
Fuck them.

00:19:13.535 --> 00:19:14.645
Just the way he pronounced it.

00:19:14.645 --> 00:19:16.205
He didn't say, fuck them.

00:19:16.205 --> 00:19:17.025
He said, "fuck'em."

00:19:18.145 --> 00:19:18.545
"Fuck'em."

00:19:18.875 --> 00:19:22.280
So he completely removed the TH from the word 'them' and said "fuck'em."

00:19:22.910 --> 00:19:27.080
It's very, very common, a very connected way of saying the words.

00:19:27.200 --> 00:19:27.670
Fuck'em!

00:19:28.460 --> 00:19:29.270
Very, very common.

00:19:29.420 --> 00:19:29.660
All right.

00:19:29.660 --> 00:19:30.980
Just so you can understand what he said.

00:19:31.400 --> 00:19:33.590
And then the last thing he said in that phrase was 'real talk'.

00:19:34.400 --> 00:19:42.080
Real talk is a phrase that just means like, um, this is, what I'm saying is true.

00:19:42.110 --> 00:19:43.250
What I'm saying is authentic.

00:19:43.250 --> 00:19:44.300
What I'm saying is real.

00:19:44.540 --> 00:19:45.260
Real talk.

00:19:45.320 --> 00:19:48.975
So if somebody says something that you think is absolutely true and you agree with,

00:19:49.274 --> 00:19:53.595
and you want to kind of emphasize the fact that you do agree and you think it's true and a hundred percent authentic,

00:19:53.595 --> 00:19:55.034
you can say, "real talk."

00:19:55.485 --> 00:19:56.595
You know, I agree.

00:19:57.135 --> 00:19:58.274
That's real what you just said.

00:19:58.305 --> 00:19:58.725
That's true.

00:19:58.725 --> 00:19:59.445
That's authentic.

00:19:59.445 --> 00:19:59.774
You know?

00:19:59.985 --> 00:20:01.815
But you can also say it when you're talking, like,

00:20:02.415 --> 00:20:04.845
"This is my point A, B and C, real talk."

00:20:05.264 --> 00:20:10.215
Which is like saying, "This is my point A, B and C, I mean, what I say, you know,

00:20:10.514 --> 00:20:12.764
this is a hundred percent true and authentic what I'm saying.

00:20:12.795 --> 00:20:13.455
It's real talk."

00:20:13.935 --> 00:20:15.354
You know, what I'm saying is real.

00:20:16.124 --> 00:20:16.725
That's the idea.

00:20:17.445 --> 00:20:18.824
All right, let's move on to the next line.

00:20:21.465 --> 00:20:22.624
...people, man.

00:20:22.814 --> 00:20:23.614
Fuck them.

00:20:23.644 --> 00:20:24.245
Real talk.

00:20:24.534 --> 00:20:27.524
At end of the day, fuck them people.

00:20:27.524 --> 00:20:27.925
You heard me?

00:20:28.754 --> 00:20:31.425
At the end of the day, fuck them people.

00:20:31.784 --> 00:20:32.235
You heard me?

00:20:32.625 --> 00:20:38.685
So, at the end of the day is a phrase that just means when all things are taken into consideration.

00:20:39.765 --> 00:20:40.035
All right.

00:20:40.035 --> 00:20:42.525
So it's a, an expression let's say.

00:20:42.765 --> 00:20:44.895
So when everything's taken into consideration,

00:20:44.895 --> 00:20:47.985
after everything is said and done, which is another way of saying it,

00:20:48.554 --> 00:20:51.135
fuck them people or those people.

00:20:51.885 --> 00:20:52.425
Same thing.

00:20:52.425 --> 00:20:54.645
It's just one is grammatically correct, the other one is not.

00:20:54.825 --> 00:20:58.235
But at the end of the day, fuck them people, you heard me?

00:20:58.545 --> 00:20:59.595
So there's that phrase again.

00:20:59.595 --> 00:21:02.535
That New Orleans phrase 'you heard me?' Maybe Louisiana...

00:21:03.405 --> 00:21:04.455
I'm not sure, like I said.

00:21:04.695 --> 00:21:07.365
But let's move on to the next line 'cause it's connected to this line.

00:21:07.935 --> 00:21:08.855
So let's play them both.

00:21:09.925 --> 00:21:12.185
Fuck them people, you heard me?

00:21:12.465 --> 00:21:15.285
In the middle of the night, fuck them people.

00:21:15.285 --> 00:21:15.514
All right.

00:21:16.035 --> 00:21:18.105
In the middle of the night, fuck them people.

00:21:18.105 --> 00:21:19.965
Now this isn't something that we say all the time.

00:21:19.995 --> 00:21:25.695
It's just, it's just a creative way of using the language because the actual expression is 'at the end of the day'.

00:21:26.385 --> 00:21:28.754
That's normal, everybody uses that and understands that,

00:21:28.754 --> 00:21:31.485
but then he says, and at, "in the middle of the night."

00:21:32.055 --> 00:21:35.520
So he's kind of taking the literal meaning of 'at the end of the day',

00:21:35.550 --> 00:21:39.030
and then he's playing with the language and saying also in the middle of the night.

00:21:40.139 --> 00:21:43.199
So 'at the end of the day' just means when everything's taken into consideration,

00:21:43.199 --> 00:21:47.310
but the literal meaning 'at the end of the day', we're talking about the time of day.

00:21:47.310 --> 00:21:48.899
You have morning, afternoon, and evening...

00:21:49.310 --> 00:21:50.130
At the end of the day.

00:21:50.370 --> 00:21:56.490
So the next line, he's playing with the literal meaning and saying also in the middle of the night, which basically means...

00:21:57.150 --> 00:22:03.750
he's trying to say all the time, not just in the morning, not just at the end of the day, but also in the middle of the night, fuck them people.

00:22:03.930 --> 00:22:04.920
Fuck them in the morning.

00:22:05.010 --> 00:22:06.130
Fuck them in the afternoon.

00:22:06.330 --> 00:22:07.270
Fuck them in the evening.

00:22:07.320 --> 00:22:08.130
Fuck them at night.

00:22:08.130 --> 00:22:09.030
Fuck them a midnight.

00:22:09.470 --> 00:22:11.580
Fuck them people, all the time.

00:22:12.090 --> 00:22:12.330
You know?

00:22:12.330 --> 00:22:14.700
So hopefully, you can understand, he's just playing with the language,

00:22:14.730 --> 00:22:18.290
putting emphasis on the fact that you need to say, "Fuck them people."

00:22:18.750 --> 00:22:20.085
Every day, all day.

00:22:21.045 --> 00:22:21.915
That's the idea.

00:22:22.635 --> 00:22:23.805
Hopefully, it makes sense.

00:22:24.135 --> 00:22:25.935
All right, so let's move on to the next line.

00:22:28.415 --> 00:22:28.745
You heard me?

00:22:28.975 --> 00:22:32.095
In the middle of the night, fuck them people.

00:22:32.095 --> 00:22:32.955
Move around them people.

00:22:32.955 --> 00:22:37.165
Let them be fifty with the fifty people they wanna be fifty with.

00:22:38.035 --> 00:22:38.485
All right.

00:22:38.485 --> 00:22:41.875
Like I said, do not feel bad if this is hard to follow, I'm going to explain it for you.

00:22:41.875 --> 00:22:43.225
Hopefully, you'll understand.

00:22:43.705 --> 00:22:44.095
All right.

00:22:44.455 --> 00:22:45.955
Move around them people.

00:22:46.015 --> 00:22:53.100
To move around, in this case, is literal and figurative 'cause to move around basically means to pass to the other side of.

00:22:53.500 --> 00:22:53.670
Right?

00:22:53.670 --> 00:22:55.500
So let's imagine these people are in front of you.

00:22:55.950 --> 00:22:58.950
You pass to the other side of them and you keep moving.

00:22:58.950 --> 00:23:00.310
You don't let them stop you.

00:23:00.330 --> 00:23:01.770
You don't let them be an obstacle.

00:23:01.770 --> 00:23:05.399
Just step to the side and keep moving forward, move around them.

00:23:05.669 --> 00:23:06.110
All right?

00:23:06.330 --> 00:23:07.649
Move around them people.

00:23:07.649 --> 00:23:09.570
Again, you should say 'those' people,

00:23:10.320 --> 00:23:14.580
but especially if you're watching this on YouTube, you can see the words that I've highlighted in different colors.

00:23:14.879 --> 00:23:18.145
You can see the patterns of grammar in his speech.

00:23:18.145 --> 00:23:20.865
You can see the patterns of pronunciation in his speech.

00:23:21.135 --> 00:23:21.435
All right.

00:23:21.435 --> 00:23:25.455
So move around 'them' people should be move around 'those' people, technically.

00:23:25.725 --> 00:23:25.995
All right.

00:23:26.175 --> 00:23:31.665
Then he says, let them be fifty with the fifty people they wanna be fifty with.

00:23:32.325 --> 00:23:33.015
Goddamn.

00:23:33.045 --> 00:23:36.745
So again, the word 'fifty' he's pronouncing 'fitty'.

00:23:37.215 --> 00:23:38.265
And he says it multiple times,

00:23:38.265 --> 00:23:40.815
"Let them be fifty with the fifty people they wanna be fifty with."

00:23:41.775 --> 00:23:42.135
Okay.

00:23:43.274 --> 00:23:48.435
He also said 'with the', let them be fifty with the fifty people.

00:23:48.915 --> 00:23:50.745
But he didn't say 'with the'.

00:23:50.945 --> 00:23:51.495
He said, "wit'the."

00:23:52.245 --> 00:23:53.294
He connected those two words.

00:23:53.294 --> 00:23:55.485
Let them be fifty with the fifty...

00:23:56.465 --> 00:23:57.374
with the.

00:23:58.074 --> 00:24:01.814
Let them be fifty with the fifty people they want to be fifty with.

00:24:02.475 --> 00:24:06.174
So again, he connected want and to and said 'wanna be fifty with'.

00:24:06.225 --> 00:24:07.185
So let me say it one more time.

00:24:07.605 --> 00:24:12.825
Let them be fifty with the fifty people they want to be fifty with.

00:24:13.065 --> 00:24:16.635
Let them be fake with the fake people they want to be fake with.

00:24:17.595 --> 00:24:17.955
Okay.

00:24:18.615 --> 00:24:21.045
Again, don't feel bad if this is kind of hard to follow or understand.

00:24:21.854 --> 00:24:24.465
You know, it's, it's a colloquial way of speaking, man.

00:24:24.465 --> 00:24:26.354
So if you can't understand, it don't feel bad.

00:24:26.354 --> 00:24:30.104
'Cause this is the type of stuff that they don't really teach in school, they don't expose you to.

00:24:30.284 --> 00:24:33.915
So this is your first time hearing somebody speak like this is going to be difficult.

00:24:33.915 --> 00:24:38.955
So don't feel bad if you're still following me at this point, congrats to you because it is difficult, man,

00:24:39.614 --> 00:24:43.694
but I'm trying to help you understand the way people actually talk here in the United States.

00:24:43.695 --> 00:24:46.395
There's many different ways to speak English and this is one of them.

00:24:46.814 --> 00:24:47.274
All right?

00:24:47.335 --> 00:24:48.024
So let's continue.

00:24:51.844 --> 00:24:52.774
Move around them people.

00:24:52.774 --> 00:24:55.504
Let them be fifty with the fifty people they wanna be fifty with.

00:24:55.715 --> 00:24:56.745
You keep being a hundred.

00:24:56.795 --> 00:24:59.075
Don't let them fifties stop you from being a hundred.

00:24:59.675 --> 00:25:00.034
All right.

00:25:00.305 --> 00:25:02.585
So you keep being a hundred.

00:25:03.365 --> 00:25:03.605
Which..

00:25:03.605 --> 00:25:04.595
You should know what that means now.

00:25:04.595 --> 00:25:05.825
You keep being authentic.

00:25:05.825 --> 00:25:08.254
You keep keeping it a hundred.

00:25:08.284 --> 00:25:09.305
You keep being real.

00:25:09.965 --> 00:25:14.525
And the next thing you said is "Don't let them fifties stop you from being hundred."

00:25:14.795 --> 00:25:23.589
Another case where he should say, don't let 'those' fifties or fake people keep you or stop you from being a hundred.

00:25:24.090 --> 00:25:24.659
So don't..

00:25:24.810 --> 00:25:25.770
You keep being real.

00:25:25.770 --> 00:25:28.590
Don't let those fake people stop you from being real.

00:25:28.980 --> 00:25:29.969
That's the idea here.

00:25:30.300 --> 00:25:30.629
All right.

00:25:31.530 --> 00:25:32.010
Next line.

00:25:34.050 --> 00:25:36.310
Don't let them fifties stop you from being a hundred.

00:25:36.510 --> 00:25:38.239
You always keep it a thousand.

00:25:38.370 --> 00:25:38.659
You heard me?

00:25:38.820 --> 00:25:39.659
No matter what.

00:25:40.230 --> 00:25:43.220
Just lay there and clear your catalog, close your cricle.

00:25:44.429 --> 00:25:44.820
All right.

00:25:45.120 --> 00:25:46.800
I played two lines only meant to play one.

00:25:46.800 --> 00:25:48.030
So let me go back to the first one.

00:25:49.230 --> 00:25:50.419
Stop you from being a hundred.

00:25:50.639 --> 00:25:52.080
You always keep it a thousand.

00:25:52.470 --> 00:25:52.770
You heard me?

00:25:52.950 --> 00:25:53.639
No matter what.

00:25:54.179 --> 00:25:56.010
All right, you always keep it at a thousand.

00:25:56.129 --> 00:25:57.659
So he's just continuing his idea.

00:25:57.870 --> 00:26:00.479
Don't let the fifties stop you from being a hundred.

00:26:00.750 --> 00:26:02.250
You always keep it a thousand.

00:26:02.460 --> 00:26:06.970
And again, when you say keep it a thousand, you're just put an emphasis on the idea of keeping it a hundred.

00:26:07.365 --> 00:26:09.465
All the way real, all the way authentic.

00:26:09.465 --> 00:26:11.535
You always keep it a thousand.

00:26:11.655 --> 00:26:12.525
Always keep it real.

00:26:12.825 --> 00:26:13.365
You heard me?

00:26:13.935 --> 00:26:14.205
Right?

00:26:14.475 --> 00:26:16.005
And then he says, "No matter what."

00:26:16.365 --> 00:26:23.535
So when we use the phrase, 'no matter what', it's like saying, 'not under any circumstances, not in any case or situation'.

00:26:23.545 --> 00:26:26.325
So you always keep it real and you never be fake.

00:26:26.835 --> 00:26:30.655
You never let somebody else stop you from being real, under any circumstances.

00:26:31.095 --> 00:26:32.145
No matter what happens.

00:26:32.145 --> 00:26:36.495
It doesn't matter what happens, regardless of what happens, independent of what happens.

00:26:36.585 --> 00:26:37.245
You see what I'm saying?

00:26:37.305 --> 00:26:41.625
That's the idea of when we say 'no matter what', not under any circumstances.

00:26:41.775 --> 00:26:42.135
Okay?

00:26:42.784 --> 00:26:43.514
Last line.

00:26:44.855 --> 00:26:48.784
Just lay there and clear your catalog, close your circle.

00:26:49.595 --> 00:26:53.075
Just lay there and clear your catalog, close your circle.

00:26:53.225 --> 00:26:55.715
So the first thing, he used the word, 'just'.

00:26:56.135 --> 00:27:00.375
In this case, when we use the word 'just', in this context, it means 'simply'.

00:27:00.855 --> 00:27:03.315
Simply lay there and clear your catalog.

00:27:03.555 --> 00:27:05.145
So the next thing you says is 'lay there'.

00:27:05.535 --> 00:27:07.365
And this is a colloquial way of speaking.

00:27:07.365 --> 00:27:10.545
And when we say 'lay there', we don't mean physically lay down.

00:27:10.875 --> 00:27:14.085
We just mean sit there or stay in your current position.

00:27:15.075 --> 00:27:15.915
And that's really what it means.

00:27:15.915 --> 00:27:19.635
So just sit there, stay in your current position and clear your catalog.

00:27:20.265 --> 00:27:24.155
So when he says 'clear your catalog', it's a figure of speech.

00:27:24.485 --> 00:27:24.975
It's like...

00:27:26.175 --> 00:27:26.755
He's saying..

00:27:26.780 --> 00:27:29.570
Let's imagine you have a list of friends in a catalog.

00:27:29.659 --> 00:27:31.629
Friend, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7.

00:27:31.879 --> 00:27:37.879
To clear your catalog means to remove everything from the catalog, to clear it, to take it back to zero,

00:27:37.879 --> 00:27:41.160
to make it so that there's nothing in the catalog.

00:27:41.400 --> 00:27:41.760
You see?

00:27:41.970 --> 00:27:45.180
So when he says clear your catalog, he's talking about your list of friends.

00:27:45.570 --> 00:27:51.000
Lay there, simply sit there and remove all those fake people from your list of friends.

00:27:51.090 --> 00:27:51.840
That's the idea.

00:27:52.110 --> 00:27:55.170
And he emphasizes that when he says, "Close your circle."

00:27:55.380 --> 00:27:57.150
Because a lot of times, at least, in English,

00:27:57.450 --> 00:28:03.155
we talk about your group of friends or colleagues or associates as 'your circle', your social circle.

00:28:03.304 --> 00:28:07.445
So when he says 'close your circle', that means it's not open anymore.

00:28:07.564 --> 00:28:10.355
People don't have access to the circle because you closed it.

00:28:10.385 --> 00:28:16.205
So take or remove everybody, all the fake people from your social circle and close the circle.

00:28:16.745 --> 00:28:21.185
Don't let anything fake or inauthentic into your circle.

00:28:21.425 --> 00:28:23.585
Clear your catalog, close your circle.

00:28:23.945 --> 00:28:25.094
You always keep it a hundred.

00:28:25.115 --> 00:28:26.195
You always keep it real.

00:28:26.254 --> 00:28:30.225
Don't let the fake, you know, stop you from being real.

00:28:31.425 --> 00:28:32.145
That's the idea.

00:28:33.645 --> 00:28:33.885
All right.

00:28:33.885 --> 00:28:40.245
My friend now, hopefully, hopefully, you should understand every single word that was said in the clip.

00:28:40.425 --> 00:28:43.935
So let's go back and listen to the entire thing one more time from start to finish

00:28:44.205 --> 00:28:48.525
and see if you can get the true message of what's being said here without any help.

00:28:48.825 --> 00:28:49.165
All right?

00:28:49.595 --> 00:28:51.765
Let's do it.

00:28:51.765 --> 00:28:57.615
See, you can be a hundred to people every day, all day, you heard me?

00:28:58.270 --> 00:29:01.300
And they can be fifty to you every day, all day.

00:29:01.360 --> 00:29:02.379
And it's all good.

00:29:02.950 --> 00:29:07.510
But once you catch on to them being a fifty and you always being a hundred,

00:29:07.960 --> 00:29:10.900
and you start moving differently, guess what they do...

00:29:11.410 --> 00:29:12.490
They get mad at you.

00:29:12.910 --> 00:29:18.410
‘Cause you done caught on to they fake bullshit they bringing to the table, and they doing, and what they want to do.

00:29:18.980 --> 00:29:21.860
They want to play victim and act like you're doing them something bad.

00:29:22.310 --> 00:29:24.930
When the whole time, you been a hundred and they been fifty.

00:29:24.980 --> 00:29:25.760
But guess what?

00:29:26.440 --> 00:29:28.200
Fuck them people, man.

00:29:28.390 --> 00:29:29.190
Fuck them.

00:29:29.220 --> 00:29:30.020
Real talk.

00:29:30.110 --> 00:29:31.740
At end of the day, fuck them people.

00:29:31.780 --> 00:29:33.180
You heard me?

00:29:33.445 --> 00:29:35.565
In the middle of the night, fuck them people.

00:29:36.295 --> 00:29:37.405
Move around on people.

00:29:37.405 --> 00:29:40.135
Let them be fifty with the fifty people they want to be fifty with.

00:29:40.345 --> 00:29:41.375
You keep being a hundred.

00:29:41.425 --> 00:29:43.625
Don't let them fifties stop you from being a hundred.

00:29:43.825 --> 00:29:45.195
You always keep a thouand.

00:29:45.685 --> 00:29:45.995
You heard me?

00:29:46.135 --> 00:29:46.975
No matter what.

00:29:47.545 --> 00:29:50.534
Just lay there and clear your catalog, close your circle.

00:29:52.075 --> 00:29:52.754
All right, my friend.

00:29:52.754 --> 00:29:55.410
So just in case you still couldn't understand..

00:29:55.410 --> 00:29:59.910
Hopefully, you could, but just in case, the main idea of this clip is from time to time,

00:29:59.910 --> 00:30:05.460
you will find yourself in situations with people who don't appreciate your authenticity or your good nature.

00:30:06.180 --> 00:30:10.530
You might do everything you can to contribute to a relationship, romantic or platonic,

00:30:11.670 --> 00:30:16.410
by being generous and authentic, and your partner could still take it for granted.

00:30:17.280 --> 00:30:21.330
You might give them the best of you and still get the worst of them in return.

00:30:21.880 --> 00:30:24.825
At the end of the day, you have no control over that.

00:30:25.995 --> 00:30:30.015
You can be a hundred percent authentic and honest with someone and they will still be fake with you.

00:30:30.565 --> 00:30:35.275
They'll still lie to you, deceive you, and treat you like an invaluable option.

00:30:35.945 --> 00:30:40.275
The resolution to this type of situation isn't to get mad and call them out on it.

00:30:40.815 --> 00:30:44.385
And you definitely shouldn't start being fake with them because when you do things like that,

00:30:44.535 --> 00:30:47.435
they will most likely get defensive and try to turn the tables.

00:30:47.465 --> 00:30:51.345
They'll try to play the victim and make it seem like you're the one that's tripping.

00:30:51.855 --> 00:30:53.385
You're the one that's being fake now.

00:30:53.745 --> 00:30:54.345
You see what I'm saying?

00:30:55.215 --> 00:30:57.345
You simply need to say, "Fuck them."

00:30:58.545 --> 00:30:59.205
Respectfully.

00:31:00.525 --> 00:31:05.565
Don't let someone else's fake behavior influence you and change your authentic behavior.

00:31:06.435 --> 00:31:11.085
Just remove the fake, deceitful, and unappreciative people from your life.

00:31:12.015 --> 00:31:15.095
Close your circle and continue to keep it a hundred.

00:31:15.588 --> 00:31:16.453
No matter what.

00:31:17.920 --> 00:31:18.671
Peace.

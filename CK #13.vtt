1
00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:01.460
Yes! Yes, ladies and gentlemen.

2
00:00:01.460 --> 00:00:04.700
That is right. Cristiano Ronaldo has returned.

3
00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:11.360
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.

4
00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:14.560
This is Coffee with Kaizen number 13 if I'm not mistaken.

5
00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:17.660
The day is Monday, August 30th, 2021.

6
00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:22.180
And if you are watching this on YouTube, you might have noticed I'm in a new location.

7
00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:26.330
Much more green, serene and peaceful location. You know what I'm saying?

8
00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:27.690
I just had to switch it up a bit.

9
00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:32.600
Hopefully, the sound of these birds and insects and things like that won't ruin the recording.

10
00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:36.640
I don't know what you can hear, but with this lovely piece of equipment in front of me,

11
00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:39.150
I can kind of control what you hear and don't hear.

12
00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:41.190
Like, they're building houses right here across the street.

13
00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:43.410
And I mean, I can literally...

14
00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:46.200
They're right in front of me and there's like drills going, like, zzzz.

15
00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:50.710
I don't know if y'all can hear that. It seems like you can't and I hope you can't.

16
00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:53.690
But if you can, my apologies.

17
00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:56.470
But anyway, man, we're going to get into the subject at hand

18
00:00:56.470 --> 00:01:02.070
Because it has been confirmed that Cristiano Ronaldo, the phenomenon,

19
00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:09.020
The superstar, the legend, the Portuguese footballing genius,

20
00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:14.920
It has been confirmed that Cristiano Ronaldo will return to the glorious Manchester United.

21
00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:20.500
The official statement from the communications department at Manchester United says,

22
00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:24.420
"Manchester United is delighted to confirm that the club has reached agreement with

23
00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:27.460
Juventus for the transfer of Cristiano Ronaldo.

24
00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:31.750
Subject to agreement of personal terms, visa, and medical".

25
00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:34.910
Cristiano, a five-time Ballon d'Or winner,

26
00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:37.960
Has so far won over 30 trophies during his career,

27
00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:40.630
Including five UEFA Champions League titles,

28
00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:45.220
Four FIFA Club World Cups, seven League titles in England, Spain,

29
00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:49.580
And Italy, and the European Championship for his native Portugal.

30
00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:57.430
In his first spell for Manchester United, he scored 118 goals in 292 games.

31
00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:02.990
Everyone at the club looks forward to welcoming Cristiano back to Manchester.

32
00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:10.290
I don't know if y'all can hear that. It's a fire truck passing by.

33
00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:16.690
What the hell is on fire at 9:30 in the morning?

34
00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:19.380
Anyway, I got to be honest, man.

35
00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:25.460
It was truly a surprise to know or to learn that Cristiano Ronaldo is returning to Manchester United because,

36
00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:29.590
You know, a lot of people knew that his contract was going to be ending in the next,

37
00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:33.320
What, ten months or something like that. And people were making speculations.

38
00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:36.820
Oh, he's going to PSG. He's going to Manchester City, you know.

39
00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:39.620
Where is he going to go? He's not happy at Juventus. He wants to leave.

40
00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:43.480
And at the end of it all, he signed with Manchester United.

41
00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:46.590
Now I know that a lot of us, including myself, are thinking, man,

42
00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:50.480
There's only a few teams on the planet that could actually pay his salary

43
00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:57.420
And pay for the transfer fee and find a place for him to actually do what he does on the pitch.

44
00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:03.080
You know what I mean? Manchester United, PSG, Manchester City, I guess Bayern Munich.

45
00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:09.060
I'm talking about teams that have the actual funds, the money to buy this player and pay him,

46
00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:14.800
I think like £400,000 every week. You know what I'm saying?

47
00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:18.850
There's only a handful of teams on the planet that could actually do that.

48
00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:23.160
And we were kind of thinking, or at least I was, how nice would it be, man,

49
00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:29.730
To see Messi and Ronaldo both retire at the same club and play...

50
00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:33.310
I mean, like their last days, their last games playing together on the same team.

51
00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:37.390
You know what I'm saying? With Neymar as well, and all the other stars of PSG,

52
00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:40.270
That would have been very, very, very interesting.

53
00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:42.860
Now, I don't know what you think. But...

54
00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:46.210
And this is no disrespect to French football or the French players

55
00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:47.640
Or anything like that, the French league.

56
00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:52.500
I'm just saying it doesn't seem as competitive as the Premier League or the Spanish League,

57
00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:55.070
Even the German League or Italian League. I don't know.

58
00:03:55.070 --> 00:04:01.840
It's just, I don't get the impression that we would get the best of Ronaldo and Messi in France.

59
00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:04.770
I mean, we always get the best of them no matter where they are.

60
00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:06.970
But I'm saying with higher competition,

61
00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:13.360
Talking about these two players when there's higher competition I just think that

62
00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:18.430
There's a higher level of output and a higher display or a greater display of talent. You know?

63
00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:21.430
They like that challenge. They want to compete with the best of the best.

64
00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:26.520
And I think, at least for Ronaldo, it was a good choice to come back to England.

65
00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:29.190
I wasn't expecting him to come back so soon.

66
00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:31.440
I always imagined that he'd be, you know,

67
00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:37.440
It would be a possibility for him to come back to United and, you know, most likely retire here.

68
00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:40.200
I think he'd play until he was 50 if you let him.

69
00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:44.640
But I imagine that this would be his resting place. I imagine this will be the last team.

70
00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:49.010
It's only right that he either retires here or maybe at Sporting. It's only right.

71
00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:53.150
And a lot of people were talking, you know, saying, oh, he's going to go to Manchester City.

72
00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:58.830
He wants to go to City. And although they could definitely pay for him and use him,

73
00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:07.050
You know, I think it would be like sacrilegious for Cristiano Ronaldo to go to Manchester City.

74
00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:11.540
Like, I know that, or I don't know, but I imagine that in his mind he's just a professional,

75
00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:14.540
He loves the team that he plays for and that's it.

76
00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:19.470
But if he gets transferred then now he loves the current team he plays for and the other team is like,

77
00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:22.310
Yeah, I have love in my heart, whatever, but it's the past.

78
00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:27.090
So I could actually see him going to Manchester City simply because he's a professional.

79
00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:31.230
And he's like, you know, yeah, I played for United, that's really where I made my name.

80
00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:36.180
But at the same time, that was years and years and years ago. It's a thing of the past.

81
00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:40.740
So, you know, they're paying me now. I want to play here now. So it is what it is.

82
00:05:41.010 --> 00:05:44.110
I could genuinely imagine him thinking that way and saying that.

83
00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:49.120
But at the same time, that's not the only thing that matters, right?

84
00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:52.340
Because, you know, the fans, supporters and everything,

85
00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:55.030
They're going to have their opinion and their reaction and things like that.

86
00:05:55.290 --> 00:05:57.040
I'm not saying Cristiano cares about that.

87
00:05:57.580 --> 00:06:00.620
I'm just saying I think it would've been a really, really,

88
00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:04.500
Really rough time at Manchester City for Cristiano Ronaldo.

89
00:06:05.630 --> 00:06:07.560
At least whenever they played United. You know what I'm saying?

90
00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:11.700
But I just think there would be so much hatred, so much hatred,

91
00:06:11.700 --> 00:06:15.850
And confusion if you would have chosen to play for Manchester City. You know?

92
00:06:15.850 --> 00:06:18.000
It would have been nice. There's a lot of great players there.

93
00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:21.330
But I just, I couldn't see it.

94
00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:24.730
So I'm happy he's back, even though it's a surprise. Very happy he's back.

95
00:06:25.490 --> 00:06:28.040
The real question, though, is where exactly is he going to play?

96
00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:32.540
You know, I was listening to interviews last night, you know,

97
00:06:32.540 --> 00:06:35.140
Kind of to prepare my thoughts and things like that for this podcast.

98
00:06:35.590 --> 00:06:38.390
And I was listening to Ole Gunnar Solskjaer.

99
00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:42.330
If you don't know who that is, he's the head coach of Manchester United.

100
00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:45.310
And he was saying that he wants Cristiano to play as a striker.

101
00:06:45.770 --> 00:06:48.620
He wants him to play number nine, which I can understand.

102
00:06:48.620 --> 00:06:50.810
Because you definitely want him in the box scoring goals.

103
00:06:50.810 --> 00:06:52.490
You definitely want him involved in the attack.

104
00:06:53.510 --> 00:06:56.180
But I'm just really curious to see how that's going to work

105
00:06:56.180 --> 00:06:58.840
Because if you look at the squad, our current squad.

106
00:07:00.380 --> 00:07:03.420
You know, it's kind of hard to see how we're going to get all these players...

107
00:07:03.710 --> 00:07:09.220
Not only getting the playing time that they want, everybody getting a chance to play,

108
00:07:09.570 --> 00:07:13.100
But finding the best combination of players because we have so many attackers,

109
00:07:13.100 --> 00:07:17.480
I'm going to go from the back to the front. And you'll see what I mean in a second.

110
00:07:17.480 --> 00:07:20.980
So on goalkeeper you have Da Gea, Tom Heaton. Right?

111
00:07:20.980 --> 00:07:22.880
Those are two main goalkeepers in this case.

112
00:07:23.380 --> 00:07:27.880
Defenders, Victor Lindelof Eric Bailly, I'm not sure if that's how you pronounce his name.

113
00:07:28.300 --> 00:07:31.000
Phil Jones is amazingly still a Manchester United player.

114
00:07:31.530 --> 00:07:35.130
Harry Maguire. Raphael Varane, another great signing in my opinion.

115
00:07:35.510 --> 00:07:41.160
Diogo Dalot, Luke Shaw, Alex Telles, Aaron Wan-Bisska, Brandon Williams,

116
00:07:41.540 --> 00:07:43.290
Amongst others midfielders.

117
00:07:43.660 --> 00:07:49.230
Paul Pogba, Juan Mata, Jesse Lingard, Andreas Pereira, Fred.

118
00:07:49.660 --> 00:07:52.360
Bruno Fernandes, another amazing signing.

119
00:07:53.170 --> 00:07:56.310
Dan James. Nemanja Matic still at the club.

120
00:07:56.310 --> 00:08:00.590
Donny Van de Beek, Scott Mctominay. We got some great midfielders.

121
00:08:01.470 --> 00:08:05.810
Now forwards, this is the point I wanted to get to or the section of the field I wanted to get to.

122
00:08:06.330 --> 00:08:08.870
Edinson Cavani, who we're going to talk about in just a second.

123
00:08:09.220 --> 00:08:12.510
Anthony Martial, Marcus Rashford, Mason Greenwood.

124
00:08:12.510 --> 00:08:16.370
Jadon Sancho, another good signing in my opinion. Anthony Elanga.

125
00:08:16.930 --> 00:08:20.630
You know, all these attacking-minded players, all these forwards,

126
00:08:21.180 --> 00:08:23.220
Where are all these players going to fit on the field?

127
00:08:23.580 --> 00:08:25.770
Plus, Cristiano Ronaldo. You know what I'm saying?

128
00:08:26.770 --> 00:08:27.890
How is that going to work exactly?

129
00:08:27.890 --> 00:08:30.580
Now, obviously, it's not a bad thing to have a deep squad.

130
00:08:30.830 --> 00:08:32.150
We learned that from Manchester City.

131
00:08:32.590 --> 00:08:36.420
It's never a bad thing because with all the competitions that we're going to be competing in,

132
00:08:37.070 --> 00:08:39.690
You know, you are going to have to rotate the players from time to time.

133
00:08:39.690 --> 00:08:42.330
They need rest even though they might want to play every game.

134
00:08:43.330 --> 00:08:46.090
You know, in most cases that's not the best idea.

135
00:08:46.500 --> 00:08:48.830
And you want to use the talent that's available to you.

136
00:08:48.980 --> 00:08:52.650
Make.. You want to mess with the team from time to time, see what works and see what doesn't.

137
00:08:52.650 --> 00:08:54.580
But that's the point. We have two issues.

138
00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:57.500
How are we going to rotate all these players effectively?

139
00:08:57.690 --> 00:09:01.180
And number two, time is not necessarily on our side.

140
00:09:01.180 --> 00:09:04.140
Now, obviously, this is a long-term project, the way I understand it.

141
00:09:04.610 --> 00:09:07.440
But in the short term, you know,

142
00:09:07.840 --> 00:09:11.050
It's going to take a while for all these players to get used to each other,

143
00:09:11.530 --> 00:09:17.260
To create some type of chemistry, to understand the way each of them play and things like that.

144
00:09:17.300 --> 00:09:18.480
You know what I mean? It's going to take time

145
00:09:18.480 --> 00:09:22.200
Because we got three or four new signings and even before they had come,

146
00:09:22.200 --> 00:09:25.200
We still hadn't really figured out how we were going to play.

147
00:09:25.660 --> 00:09:30.140
I mean, for the last five, six, seven years,

148
00:09:30.140 --> 00:09:33.760
We've kind of just been going up and down and left and right and up and down.

149
00:09:34.140 --> 00:09:37.790
You know, we have some great games and great weeks and great months and

150
00:09:37.790 --> 00:09:40.740
Then it's just fucking tragedy. So inconsistent.

151
00:09:41.140 --> 00:09:42.920
So I think now we've made some good signings.

152
00:09:43.250 --> 00:09:45.740
Things are looking optimistic at the club.

153
00:09:45.740 --> 00:09:51.600
But the real question is, you know, how are we going to manage and rotate these players?

154
00:09:52.110 --> 00:09:55.240
And then it's really just a question of time on how long it's going to take

155
00:09:55.240 --> 00:09:57.940
For us to get a real understanding of each other.

156
00:09:58.470 --> 00:10:02.160
The philosophy at the club, you know, a playing style and all that type of stuff.

157
00:10:02.160 --> 00:10:07.630
It's going to take time. I'm optimistic, but not unrealistic.

158
00:10:08.110 --> 00:10:12.150
And you know, there are also some people that are of the opinion that

159
00:10:12.490 --> 00:10:15.530
This purchase of Cristiano Ronaldo really wasn't a good idea.

160
00:10:15.860 --> 00:10:19.450
Because when you think about the millions and millions of pounds

161
00:10:19.450 --> 00:10:23.710
That they paid for the transfer fee and now the hundreds of thousands of pounds

162
00:10:23.710 --> 00:10:27.400
They're going to pay every week in this player's salary.

163
00:10:27.880 --> 00:10:29.370
They could have used that money for something better.

164
00:10:29.370 --> 00:10:32.490
They could have bought more midfielders or defenders or, you know,

165
00:10:32.560 --> 00:10:34.150
Two or three attackers or whatever it is.

166
00:10:34.150 --> 00:10:39.120
Some people have that opinion, and I don't necessarily disagree with it. You know?

167
00:10:39.120 --> 00:10:44.830
Because you could argue that Renaldo is at the end of his career.

168
00:10:45.690 --> 00:10:48.840
So it makes much more sense. If we're building for the future,

169
00:10:48.840 --> 00:10:52.890
It would make more sense to buy players that we can work with and grow with

170
00:10:53.170 --> 00:10:56.370
And basically invest in knowing that they're going to be with the club for five,

171
00:10:56.370 --> 00:10:58.520
Six, seven, ten years, whatever it may be.

172
00:10:59.120 --> 00:11:02.720
You know, even that idea might be unrealistic in today's world because

173
00:11:02.830 --> 00:11:05.880
They're moving players around like, you know, like it's nothing.

174
00:11:05.970 --> 00:11:10.470
But I'm saying you could argue that it wasn't the best investment of money.

175
00:11:11.560 --> 00:11:14.370
You could also argue that it was really more of a financial move

176
00:11:14.370 --> 00:11:17.430
And not a football move if you think about the owners of the club.

177
00:11:18.290 --> 00:11:20.600
I mean, they got deep pockets, we all know that.

178
00:11:21.050 --> 00:11:24.540
But they might have been just thinking we're going to sell more t-shirts now that Ronaldo is back.

179
00:11:24.540 --> 00:11:26.790
We're going to sell more tickets. It's good for the brand.

180
00:11:27.190 --> 00:11:29.560
You know, everybody is going to have eyes on Manchester United now.

181
00:11:29.750 --> 00:11:32.530
They might have been thinking from the financial perspective,

182
00:11:32.670 --> 00:11:35.950
The financial benefits of signing a superstar like that.

183
00:11:36.370 --> 00:11:40.390
We don't know. But the point is, you could argue it wasn't the best decision.

184
00:11:41.430 --> 00:11:45.010
But you could kind of say the same thing about Messi moving to PSG.

185
00:11:45.050 --> 00:11:50.600
Like, let's not forget that before this move happened, we could all kind of agree,

186
00:11:50.920 --> 00:11:56.600
Or most of us could kind of agree Cristiano Ronaldo was still one of the best players on the planet.

187
00:11:56.660 --> 00:11:59.970
Profesional, anyway. One of the best players on the planet.

188
00:11:59.970 --> 00:12:03.100
So you could argue, yeah, he's what, 36, 37.

189
00:12:03.100 --> 00:12:06.600
He's at the end of his career, maybe wasn't the best move,

190
00:12:06.960 --> 00:12:11.260
But I still think he's going to score a lot of goals, create a lot more goals

191
00:12:11.260 --> 00:12:12.680
And be a great addition to the team.

192
00:12:12.680 --> 00:12:18.150
I think he'll be a great addition to any team anywhere. So I'm definitely excited about that.

193
00:12:18.420 --> 00:12:21.690
But what's interesting to know, I was reading this article last night,

194
00:12:21.690 --> 00:12:26.600
It says that Manchester United's signing of Cristiano Ronaldo has put them

195
00:12:26.980 --> 00:12:29.800
To the top of the Premier League spending table this season,

196
00:12:30.150 --> 00:12:32.360
Just edging out Arsenal who are second.

197
00:12:32.790 --> 00:12:35.340
So while the Gunners have made five major signings this summer,

198
00:12:35.640 --> 00:12:41.060
Man United have made just three but have opted for a quality over quantity approach in their deals.

199
00:12:41.830 --> 00:12:45.920
Of course, the other big spenders are also members of the Big Six with Chelsea

200
00:12:45.920 --> 00:12:48.650
And Manchester City key players in the transfer window.

201
00:12:49.220 --> 00:12:52.370
Now the question is, which Premier League team has spent the most?

202
00:12:53.010 --> 00:12:56.800
Until Ronaldo's return to Manchester United, Arsenal were top of the spending table.

203
00:12:57.430 --> 00:13:01.160
Man United have signed big-money deals for Raphael Varane and Jadon Sancho.

204
00:13:01.530 --> 00:13:04.780
And though their move for Ronaldo is relatively modest,

205
00:13:04.780 --> 00:13:08.820
With the total value of the deal not coming in at more than £28 million,

206
00:13:10.470 --> 00:13:13.730
For a player with such a track record, it remains an impressive addition.

207
00:13:14.470 --> 00:13:17.540
Arsenal, meanwhile, have come under scrutiny for their deals in the window,

208
00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:25.070
Notably splashing £50 million on Ben White and around £30 million on Martin Odegaard.

209
00:13:25.900 --> 00:13:31.480
It is a volume of business that the manager, Mikel Arteta has admitted must yield results.

210
00:13:31.480 --> 00:13:32.930
Now I want to go back and make a correction

211
00:13:33.270 --> 00:13:39.340
Because the transfer value or fee is not £28 million, it's €28 million for Ronaldo.

212
00:13:39.930 --> 00:13:44.430
I just noticed that. So I'm looking at this table here and it is an estimated number.

213
00:13:44.490 --> 00:13:51.560
These are all estimated numbers. Manchester United in this transfer window has spent £133 million.

214
00:13:53.480 --> 00:13:57.960
Arsenal £130 million. Manchester City £115 million.

215
00:13:58.130 --> 00:14:05.220
Chelsea £103.5 million. Aston Villa spent 95 million and the list goes on and on.

216
00:14:05.220 --> 00:14:06.230
I'm not going to read all of them,

217
00:14:06.610 --> 00:14:08.880
But a lot of money has been transferred this season.

218
00:14:09.080 --> 00:14:12.060
A lot of players have been transferred this season as always.

219
00:14:12.330 --> 00:14:15.770
But I think that things are looking very, very, very exciting,

220
00:14:15.800 --> 00:14:20.840
Not just for Manchester United, but the Premier League in general, football in general.

221
00:14:21.110 --> 00:14:24.690
And I think we all have our eyes on Champions League this year.

222
00:14:24.820 --> 00:14:26.330
I think it's going to be real interesting.

223
00:14:26.620 --> 00:14:31.080
But please let me know what your thoughts are on this move from Juventus to Manchester United.

224
00:14:31.080 --> 00:14:33.960
Do you think it was a good move? Do you think it was a waste of money?

225
00:14:33.960 --> 00:14:36.210
Do you think he's going to be a good addition to the team?

226
00:14:36.590 --> 00:14:39.950
What do you think Manchester United is going to do this year in the Premier League

227
00:14:40.350 --> 00:14:42.120
And in the Champions League?

228
00:14:42.120 --> 00:14:44.530
Let me know in the comments below if you're watching us on YouTube

229
00:14:44.620 --> 00:14:48.640
Or feel free to shoot me a message on social at @englishwithkaizen.

230
00:14:49.030 --> 00:14:51.950
Instagram is probably the best place to send me a message, but just be patient, you know,

231
00:14:51.950 --> 00:14:55.030
Because I get tons of messages, I try to respond to them all.

232
00:14:55.030 --> 00:14:56.360
But let me know, man, what do you think?

233
00:14:56.680 --> 00:15:00.040
You know how much I love football if you've been listening to the podcast for a while now.

234
00:15:00.350 --> 00:15:06.110
You know how much I love Manchester United and now you know I'm a huge Cristiano Ronaldo fan.

235
00:15:06.350 --> 00:15:07.760
Not just because he played for United,

236
00:15:08.030 --> 00:15:10.250
Not just because he's known as one of the best on the planet.

237
00:15:10.480 --> 00:15:13.650
But I truly think he's a great professional, not just a footballer.

238
00:15:13.780 --> 00:15:18.300
I think if you look into the mind and the character and the habits, you know,

239
00:15:18.300 --> 00:15:21.160
The behavior of somebody like Cristiano Ronaldo, you see it's...

240
00:15:21.960 --> 00:15:23.520
In my opinion, it's deeper than football.

241
00:15:23.520 --> 00:15:27.400
It's not that he's just a footballer. You know what I'm saying?

242
00:15:27.520 --> 00:15:31.400
It's the mentality of the footballer that's interesting to me.

243
00:15:31.660 --> 00:15:35.530
And when it comes to character, when it comes to professionalism, you know,

244
00:15:35.650 --> 00:15:40.940
I think it's difficult to find a lot of players at that level. You know what I'm saying?

245
00:15:41.160 --> 00:15:43.680
But anyway, I'm not going to take any more of your time, man.

246
00:15:43.680 --> 00:15:46.480
I just wanted to share the news, even though I'm sure you've heard.

247
00:15:46.480 --> 00:15:50.010
It kind of broke the Internet when the news was released.

248
00:15:50.010 --> 00:15:52.110
And there's very few people on the planet that can do that,

249
00:15:52.110 --> 00:15:57.130
That can simply go from one team to another, announce it and literally like, break the internet.

250
00:15:57.200 --> 00:15:59.230
People were going crazy about it. You know what I'm saying?

251
00:15:59.670 --> 00:16:03.270
So I just wanted to talk about it real quick and more importantly, or more interestingly,

252
00:16:03.490 --> 00:16:08.480
Get your opinions on this move and know what you think the future holds for Cristiano Ronaldo,

253
00:16:08.540 --> 00:16:11.940
Manchester United, the Premier League, and football in general.

254
00:16:11.940 --> 00:16:15.690
But that's Coffee with Kaizen number 13 in the books.

255
00:16:15.960 --> 00:16:18.490
And I will talk to you later. Peace!
